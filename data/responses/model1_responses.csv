Use full sentences in your response.",What works have been cited?,"2.1   IntroductionDefining  terminology  is  a useful starting  point  when  reading  or writing  on  the subject of  service to prevent any  confusion or assumptions that we  all understand the terms to  mean the  same thing. So,  what do we  mean by  goods, products and services? This is a book about service, but what is a ‘service’ and how is it different to  ‘goods’  or  ‘products’?  Whilst  most  people  intuitively  know  the  difference between  a product and service,  actually defining  this  difference with clarity  and accuracy of text is not straight forward. The terms ‘goods’ and ‘products’ appear to be used interchangeably in much of the literature, but even here we can find debate about  meaning  (Araujo  and  Spring  2006;  Callon  1991,  2002).  However,  for  the sake of brevity we will here accept that they both refer to the same thing and focus on attempts  to differentiate goods and services.  This quest  is far from straightfor-ward.  Since  the  early eighteenth century  academics  and  scholars  from  different domains have attempted  to define these  terms  explicitly (Say 1803;  Levitt 1981; Hill 1999; Gadrey 2000). In this chapter we will attempt to illustrate their findings in order to provide some background to the debate.
2.2   GoodsIn the eighteenth century Adam  Smith (1776) stated that goods  have exchange-able value and so  a  characteristic of a  good is that  its  ownership rights  can be established  and exchanged.  Goods  can be considered  as embodying specialised knowledge in a way that  is highly advantageous  for  promoting  the  division  of labour  (Smith 1776; Demsetz 1993).  Nassau Senior  (1863)  described  goods as material things, meaning  that goods  are tangible and  have physical  dimensions. These  concepts  were  still  accepted  over  100  years  later  when  The  System  of National Accounts (SNA) (1993)  defined goods  as physical objects for which a demand exists, over which ownership rights can be established and whose owner-ship  can  be  transferred  from  one  institutional  unit  to  another  by  engaging  in transactions  on  markets.  Hill  (1999)  summed  up  the  major  characteristics  of goods as an entity that exists independently of its owner and preserves its identity through time; his definition supporting of that of the SNA. Following these defini-tions we can outline a set of attributes for goods:Physical objects for which a demand exists•Their physical attributes are preserved over time•Ownership rights can be established•They exist independently of their owner•They are exchangeable•Unit ownership rights can be exchanged between institutions•They can be traded on markets•They embody specialised  knowledge in  a way that  is highly  advantageous for •promoting the division of labourThese  attributes  are  broadly accepted  by  academics  and  reflect 200  years  of ongoing debate. 
2.3   ServicesAlthough we have found a long standing agreement over the definition of products/goods and their characteristics, the definition of services has never reached consen-sus. Consequently it is hard to obtain full acceptance about the distinction between goods  and  services.  Here  we will present some  of  the  different  perspectives on service from the literature.
2.4   Intangible, Heterogeneous, Inseparable & Perishable (IHIP) CharacteristicsAs marketers began to recognise  and emphasise  the importance of  services (Fisk et al. 1993) they consequently called for services to form a separate part of a com-panies’ marketing strategy (Lovelock 1983).

The culmination of a special three-year R&D project, Wharfedale’s new flagship speakers are the ultimate expression of pure musical enjoyment embedded at the heart of this famous British brand.

Cambridgeshire, England – In Greek mythology, the Elysian Fields are a heavenly place where the heroic and the virtuous are rewarded in the afterlife. Elysian, as an adjective, means blissful – a fitting name for Wharfedale’s new flagship loudspeakers, conceived to deliver blissful sonic reward to music lovers seeking heavenly respite from the rigours of daily life.

Two Elysian loudspeakers have been created; a large standmount model called Elysian 2 (£4,500 per pair) and a floorstanding speaker named Elysian 4 (£6,500 per pair). Both speakers were developed concurrently with the EVO4 Series, which launched towards the end of 2019 and sits immediately below Elysian in Wharfedale’s new hierarchy.

Elysian and EVO4 share many design elements, having benefitted from the same R&D process as part of a unified project. The core speakers in both ranges are three-way designs, sporting an unusual and sophisticated driver array including an Air Motion Transformer (AMT) high-frequency unit. But with Elysian, each component part is engineered to the very highest standard. The drivers, the crossover, the cabinet – every aspect has been developed in harmony and without cost constraint to push the project to its performance limit. Many of these elements were trickled down, remodelled and engineered in a more affordable form to create the EVO4 Series, enabling the speakers in this range to deliver astounding value for money.

With the EVO4 Series already winning major awards, now is the time for Wharfedale to unleash Elysian.

Elysian AMT Treble Unit

In the 1940s, Wharfedale’s founder, Gilbert Briggs, developed the first two-way speaker for domestic use, radical for its separate treble and bass drivers combined via a crossover. Early treble units, such as Brigg’s famous Super 3, resembled small cones as the necessity for reproducing high frequencies demanded the use of low-mass diaphragms. It was subsequently realized that the dome in the centre of the cone was doing most of the work and this gave rise to the now ubiquitous dome tweeter.

Dome treble units have dominated the hi-fi scene for decades, but they are not necessarily the ideal way of reproducing the exact harmonics of the musical waveform. In order to reduce moving mass, the dome has to be small and use ultra-thin materials, both of which counteract its efficiency and accuracy.

The AMT is a radically different way of moving air, using a large, pleated, lightweight diaphragm driven across its surface by rows of strategically placed metallic strips immersed in a strong magnetic field. The pleats in the diaphragm contract and expand under the influence of the musical drive, squeezing the air between them to form the desired waveform.

Not only is this an efficient way of moving air, it is also highly accurate as the diaphragm is under close control of the motor system at all times. The result is a wide bandwidth transducer that achieves extremely low distortion and wonderful musical detail, with scintillating speed and dynamic ability.

The development of this AMT unit was a key part of the Elysian/EVO4 project. The Elysian AMT is larger and of higher specification than the one used in the EVO4 Series, featuring an ultra-lightweight diaphragm material called PET and an acoustically damped rear chamber, delivering even more spellbindingly clear and sweetly extended high frequencies.

Elysian Midrange Driver

In the spirit of Gilbert Briggs, who was well known for experimenting with new driver materials, Wharfedale investigated a range of options to match the sensitivity and accuracy of the AMT treble unit.

The company settled on a proprietary woven glass fibre matrix, formed into a 150mm cone. This provides a superb combination of low mass and high strength, with the addition of a high-plasticity coating to control its acoustic behaviour. With such a low-mass cone, only a low-damping, foamed, rubber-like material would match for the surround – again, coated for durability.

A central phase plug is specially shaped to linearise the output across a wide bandwidth, even off-axis, enhancing a natural response to the music that can be heard anywhere the listener wishes to sit.

This midrange driver enables the Elysian speakers to deliver voices and instruments with astonishing realism. Vocalists seem to be present in the room with the listener – simply close your eyes and listen to the palpable presence of singers in the acoustic space.

Elysian Bass Driver

The midrange unit is matched with a glass fibre matrix cone for the bass unit, in this case terminated with a highly flexible rubber surround and driven by a specially developed low-distortion motor system.

In order to plumb the depths of the lowest frequencies in recorded music, the 220mm bass units – one in the Elysian 2, two in the Elysian 4 – are capable of reaching down below 28Hz in-room, revealing the full body and impact of percussion, stringed and wind instruments.

The bass units are loaded by an advanced version of Wharfedale’s signature slot-loaded port. Christened SLPP (Slot-Loaded Profiled Port), it ensures that the rear output of the bass units is not wasted. Instead, the lowest frequency energy is vented to a slot at the base of the speaker, specially profiled to equalise the high internal pressure to the low pressure in the room.

This reduces the distortion that is typical of bass reflex systems and increases the port’s efficiency. In addition, because the air is dispersed uniformly in the room, the speakers are less fussy about siting.

Elysian Crossover Network

The drivers’ output is combined via a sophisticated crossover network, fine-tuned over hundreds of hours of listening tests to ensure a seamless blend between the drive units.

Of particular note is the phase consistency across the driver output, permitting a wide range of seating positions and encouraging the power response to be highly linear throughout the listening room. Only the highest grade, acoustically transparent components are used throughout the crossover network, ensuring all the musical detail is heard with nothing held back.

Elysian Cabinet

The Elysian speaker cabinets are designed to enhance the acoustic output of the drivers and provide a piece of furniture of which the owner can be justly proud. Handcrafted veneers are enhanced by true piano finish lacquers, hand-polished to six levels of depth to give a truly beautiful finish.

Beneath the veneer is a sandwich of woods of differing density, designed to reduce panel resonance to below audibility. Named PROS (Panel Resonance Optimization System), this multi-layer construction also inhibits the leakage of unwanted sound energy from inside the cabinet, which would otherwise interfere with the forward output of the drive units.

Both Elysian models have a wide stature that complements the output of the drive units by helping them match to the acoustics of the room – an aspect of home audio reproduction that has been largely overlooked amid the modern trend to design slim, compact loudspeakers. One key aspect is the wide baffle, finished with radiused edges to smooth the flow of sonic energy around the cabinet.

Speaking about the development of Elysian, Wharfedale’s Director of Acoustic Design, Peter Comeau, said: “Our aim for the Elysian/EVO4 project was to deliver a new flagship for Wharfedale (Elysian) whilst creating design elements that could be trickled down to a more affordable, mid-range series (EVO4).

While we are justly proud of the value for money offered by the EVO4 Series, the two Elysian models represent the pinnacle of our achievements – loudspeakers that deliver an exceptional high-end performance yet still cost much less than many of the models with which they compete.”

Comeau added, “The cabinet design, in combination with the drive units, allows the Elysian speakers to convey the full body of instruments like cello and bass guitar, without constraining the dynamics of the musical recital. Whether you’re listening to solo piano, a full orchestra, a jazz trio or a rock band, these speakers bring the thrill and excitement of the performance to your listening room.”

The Wharfedale Elysian 2 and Elysian 4 are available in the UK from this month. RRPs are £4,500 per pair (£4,900 with matching stands) and £6,500 per pair respectively. Finish options are walnut, black or white, hand-finished in high-gloss piano lacquer.","The Elysian speakers are named after the Elysian Fields in Greek mythology, a heavenly place for the heroic and virtuous.

Mismatch repair deficiency occurs when tumor cells have a mutation in one of several genes that normally correct mistakes in the DNA code. Without that DNA spellchecker, the tumor constantly accumulates genetic mutations, leading to a high tumor mutational burden. To investigate why some tumors with deficient mismatch repair don’t respond to immune checkpoint inhibitors, Dr. Westcott and his colleagues genetically engineered mice to spontaneously grow lung or colorectal tumors that were either deficient in mismatch repair or had functioning mismatch repair.  Tumors that were deficient in mismatch repair had many more mutations than tumors with functioning mismatch repair, the researchers confirmed.  When they treated both sets of mice with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, they found an unexpected result: mismatch repair–deficient tumors didn’t shrink any more than tumors with functioning mismatch repair. In further experiments, the team figured out why. It came down to both the diversity and the type of mutations in the tumors, Dr. Westcott explained.
The mismatch repair–deficient tumors had a lot of genetic diversity, meaning each mutation was only in a small fraction of cancer cells. And cancer-killing immune cells couldn't efficiently attack tumors with high genetic diversity, the researchers found. But when they created tumors in which all of the cancer cells had the same mutations, immune checkpoint inhibitors shrank the tumors and kept them at bay for months. The type of mutation also appeared to influence how immune system responds to tumors. Some mutations cause tumor cells to produce abnormal bits of proteins on their surface, called neoantigens. Neoantigens help the immune system spot cancer cells, whereas other types of mutations are less likely to jump-start the immune system.  Cancer-killing immune cells launched a massive attack against tumors in which all of the cancer cells had the same neoantigen, called clonal neoantigens. But that attack weakened when only a fraction of the cancer cells had the neoantigen, the researchers found.","Neoantigens help the immune system spot cancer cells.

389,Only use information from the supplied context. Do not use outside information. Do not use extraneous text. Use bullets in at least some capacity to answer the questions. Your response should be under 100 words.,What are the five broad categories of business?,"Defining a successful business 
EVERY ENTREPRENEUR ASPIRES to create a successful 
business, and investors certainly want management to run successful 
businesses. So what determines whether a business is being successful? 
Before answering this question, it is helpful to define what a business 
is and the various forms it can take.
A business is a commercial operation that provides products or 
services with the aim of making a profit for the benefit of its owners. The 
significant point is “for the benefit of its owners”, which differentiates 
it from a government or not-for-profit organisation, such as a charity, 
where the activity is conducted for the benefit of the people it serves.
A profit is an essential element of running a successful business. It 
is a trading surplus whereby the revenues earned exceed the costs. This 
surplus belongs to the owners of the business to use as they choose: 
to take for themselves, to reinvest back in the business, or a mixture 
of the two. For a government organisation or charity, any surplus is 
reinvested in the activities to further benefit the people it serves.
Business structure 
A business can take many forms, ranging from a sole trader to a large 
multinational company. The principal aim of making a profit for its 
owners is still the same. 
A person starting out and setting up a business will take all the risk 
and reward as the venture gets under way. As the business grows it can 
be advantageous to share the risk with others and separate the business 
activities from those of the owner by establishing a company.
A company is a legal entity in its own right that is separate from its 
2017 Guide Financial Management.indd 1 22/01/2018 13:36
2 guide to financial management
owners. An investor is risking only the money paid for buying some 
shares in the company. If the company ceases trading, the shareholders 
(owners) are not liable to make up any shortfall between the value of 
the company’s assets and its liabilities.
There are five broad categories of business:
■ Sole trader. Someone who sets up a business alone and takes all 
the risk and reward of running it, and who may employ staff.
■ Partnership. Two or more people who set up a business together. 
The partners have joint ownership and share the risk and reward 
of running the business. Like a sole trader they may employ staff.
■ Limited liability partnership (LLP). A hybrid of a partnership 
and a company which provides the owners with the limited 
risk of a company and the shared ownership and tax status of a 
partnership.
■ Private company. Usually a small organisation raising its money 
from a few private investors. The shares may be difficult to trade 
as they are not listed on any stock market. Investors’ liability in 
private and public companies is limited to the amount of their 
investment.
■ Public company. Typically a large organisation that is usually 
listed on a stock exchange. Because of its size it may require 
significant investment, and hence it may need to draw investment 
from many investors.
In this book the focus is mainly on companies, though the principles 
can be equally well applied to a sole trader, a partnership and indeed 
not-for-profit organisations.
The role of the board 
The directors of a company are people hired (and at times fired) by the 
shareholders to be stewards of their investment. However, they need 
to balance this with their primary fiduciary duty as a director, which 
is to act in the best interests of the company. Collectively, a board of 
directors has overall responsibility for running a company successfully. 
This is achieved by setting and implementing its strategy.
2017 Guide Financial Management.indd 2 22/01/2018 13:36
Defining a successful business 3
In fulfilling the strategic aims of the company, the board will 
be responsible for making sure not only that the company has the 
necessary resources in terms of investment, assets and people, but 
also that there are appropriate operating controls and procedures for 
managing business risk and making sure that all monies that flow 
through the business are properly accounted for.
What is a successful business? 
The media love to report on successful entrepreneurs and tell of how 
they beat the odds as they built their business and became household 
names. The media also enjoy revelling in the collapse of mighty 
organisations and unpicking the journey to their downfall. So what is 
it that defines business success or failure?
Many descriptions are used to describe success, including “the 
business is profitable”, “revenue is growing” and “the share price is 
rising”. All these attributes are elements of success, though individually 
they do not embrace the totality. To be successful in business is to 
“create a sustainable superior return on investment”.
The core element of this definition is “return on investment” (ROI). 
The business, having been built from money provided by investors, has 
a responsibility to reward those investors for risking their money in 
the venture. The ROI is a measure of the reward being generated. The 
concept is similar to a savings account, where an amount of money 
is placed on deposit with a bank and the investor earns interest on it. 
Despite the banking crisis of 2008 and its aftermath, the investment in 
a savings account is still seen as low risk and consequently the return 
that the investor will make is similarly low.

Therefore, if a deposit of $1,000 is placed in a bank and the gross 
interest earned over a year is $30, the ROI can be expressed as being 3%.
For a business to be successful it needs to reward investors by 
making them wealthier than they would have been by putting their 
money in a savings account. Why should they accept the greater risk 
of investing in a business, with all the uncertainty it faces, if they are 
2017 Guide Financial Management.indd 3 22/01/2018 13:36
4 guide to financial management
not going to be any better off? The return that investors would require 
might be double or more than a savings account, depending on the 
perceived risk, which will be related to factors such as the nature and 
maturity of the business.
The return in a business is derived from the profit it generates 
compared with the money invested to achieve that profit.

Therefore, if investors place $1,000 in a business and the operating 
profit over a year is $200, the ROI can be expressed as being 20%. Some 
examples of the returns achieved by companies in 2016 and stated 
in their annual reports are Walmart (a retailer) 15.5%, ExxonMobil 
(an oil company) 3.9% and Anglo American (an international mining 
company) 11.0%. 
Generating a “superior” return is to achieve a ROI that is greater than 
the rate achieved by businesses running similar activities in similar 
markets, and so to be successful is to generate a return that is at least as 
good as that achieved by your competitors, but ideally better than them.
A “sustainable” superior return is perhaps the most difficult 
objective to achieve. It means generating a superior rate of return year 
in, year out. A business may be flying high when its products or services 
are in fashion. But the fall can be swift when its products or services 
are no longer in vogue and the business has gone from producing 
superior returns to producing inferior ones. To be sustainable is to 
continuously develop the business proposition in a way that keeps 
customers buying the company’s products or services in preference to 
those of its competitors. Innovation, technology and cost reduction are 
all activities that can help maintain a sustainable return.
For example, the returns generated by the mobile phone company 
Nokia in 2006 were almost 46%. They resulted from a pre-eminence 
in a growing market coupled with an ability to continue to introduce 
new technology and ignite passion for the company’s latest products. 
Subsequently, Nokia failed to offer leading technology and was late in 
offering smartphones. As a result, it lost customers and the superior 
returns declined; in 2012 Nokia reported losses of €2.3 billion and was 
finally bought by Microsoft in April 2014.

At the same time as Nokia was declining, Apple, its American rival, 
was rising. The two companies’ ROI between 2006 and 2012 is shown 
in Figure 1.1.
On creating a superior ROI the directors of a company have two 
choices. They can either distribute the wealth to the investors or retain 
it in the business. The second option depends on whether the directors 
can identify further investment opportunities that will create even 
more wealth in the future. Profits can be retained in a company while 
investment opportunities are identified. However, this is only in the 
short term as investors (particularly in public companies) will demand 
the cash be “earning or returning”.
Wealth is created for investors in a business in two ways:
■ annual income – a distribution of profit to the investor (by way of 
a dividend);
■ capital growth – a reinvestment back in the business to increase 
its value (share price).
Shareholder value 
The term “shareholder value” is also used to describe success. Two 
definitions of shareholder value are:
■ a concept that focuses strategic and operational decision-making 
on steadily increasing a company’s value for shareholders;
■ maximising shareholder benefit by focusing on raising company 
earnings and the share price.
These definitions focus more on increasing the value of a business 
in the long term rather than delivering a profit in the short term. An 
example would be Amazon, one of the best-known online retailers, 
where the initial strategy was to invest in building the distribution 
network and customer base as the foundation of the business. Once 
customer numbers grew the profits would emerge. Throughout its 
early years the company was creating long-term value while making 
large losses. During this period Amazon’s share price was volatile as 
it reflected changing views on the future benefits that would arise for 
investors.
For a mature business, an example would be its investment in 
research and development to provide the products and revenue streams 
of the future. This investment can create shareholder value because 
of the potential it is judged to provide. However, the danger is that 
success is built on a future promise, and in a fast-changing world the 
future is always uncertain. For example, AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical 
company, had taken years to develop a new lung cancer drug only to find 
in July 2017 that the trials had failed: its share price fell 16% in one day.
For a company that is quoted on a stock market, there is the 
expectation to achieve a sufficient ROI every year while also investing 
to create future value. Once the business has started to make profits, 
any performance that is worse than the previous year is likely to meet 
with an adverse reaction from analysts and investors, which in many 
instances can lead to a forced change of management.
In February 2017 Unilever, a food company, defended a hostile bid 
from Kraft Foods on the basis that it would complete a “comprehensive 
review of options available to accelerate delivery of value for the 
benefit of our shareholders”. Like all other global companies, it battles 
to produce the ever more superior results that stockmarket investors 
look for.
The details of the measures used to monitor ROI and shareholder 
value creation are explained in Chapter 14.","*   Sole trader

The surgeon, anesthesiologist, physician’s assistant, or nurse 
practitioner will write an order that specifies how often the vital signs 
should be checked. Measuring the pulse and blood pressure every 15 
minutes in the first hour after the operation is not unusual. The CNA 
should always let the supervising nurse or physician know about a 
fever or an abnormal pulse or blood pressure. This is especially 
important when caring for a post-operative patient. Slight deviations of 
pulse and blood pressure may be normal after surgery, but these 
should still be reported. It should not be assumed that a pulse greater 
than 100, or a systolic blood pressure that is low, are of no concern.
Mental Status
Drowsiness is expected after surgery. This can be minimal or it may be 
significant. However, excessive drowsiness or drowsiness that is not 
improving is not normal. A nurse or physician should be informed if a 
patient’s mental status appears abnormal.
Pain
Pain is inevitable following surgery. An incision has been made through 
the skin, and the swelling and bleeding at the incision increase 
pressure on nerve endings, contributing to the pain. Some patients will 
inform the CNA or nurse about their pain and request medications, but 
others will not. 
The CNA should always ask the post-operative patient if pain is 
occurring, but should also be observant to recognize the nonverbal 
signs of pain. A patient may decide to endure the pain without taking 
pain medication because of feeling wary about accepting medication. 
Aside from specifically asking the patient about pain, the CNA should 
look for objective information and nonverbal cues that indicate the 
presence of pain. Does the patient grimace when asked to move? Is 
the patient hesitant about performing coughing and deep breathing 
exercises? Is the patient’s blood pressure and heart rate elevated? If 
the patient is showing evidence of any of the above, the CNA may 
reasonably assume that a significant level of pain is occurring. Pain 
control is important as it increases patient compliance with post-operative movement and surgical wound healing measures, and the 
speed of recovery. It is also important to address physical suffering in 
the post-operative phase to improve standard quality measures of 
patient comfort during hospital care.
The level of pain a patient has will depend in part on what operation 
was performed. The pain associated with a minor procedure should be 
mild, but if the patient has had a major orthopedic surgery, such as 
hip surgery, the pain can be severe. There is no “normal” level of pain 
and each person has an individual level of tolerance. If the procedure 
was a simple one, and the patient is significantly uncomfortable, this
may indicate a problem. If the CNA notices the patient is 
uncomfortable, a nurse or physician should always be informed. If the 
patient is requesting pain medication more frequently than it has been 
prescribed, this is a warning sign.
 
Many healthcare facilities use pain scales to assess a patient’s level of 
pain. A typical pain scale is the 1-10 scale. The patient is asked to 
remember the worst pain ever experienced and consider that a level 
10. The patient is then asked to remember a painful experience that 
was very minor and consider that a level 1. After that, the patient is 
asked to assign the current level of pain a number on the 1-10 pain 
scale. The CNA would ask the patient, for example, “If the worst pain 
you have ever felt was a 10 and a very minor pain you’ve experienced 
was a 1, what would you consider your current level of pain to be?”
Surgical Dressing
A surgical dressing is a sterile cover applied over the incision. A 
dressing can be a small bandage, or it may be a large, complicated 
affair with gauze pads and tape. The surgeon will write orders that 
specify how to care for the dressing. It is very important to follow 
these orders exactly. The CNA should not change or adjust the 
dressing in any way that has not been ordered. The dressing should be 
checked frequently to make sure it is intact and that there are no loose 
edges. Any bleeding or unusual drainage should be noted, and if the 
CNA notices either one, a supervising nurse or physician needs to be 
notified.","* Increases patient compliance with post-operative movement.

Your answer must be 100 words or less.,What arguments did the US Court of appeals reject?,"In April 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued a rule prohibiting most employers from
entering into or enforcing non-compete agreements with workers, subject to exceptions for the sale of a
business and preexisting non-competes with senior executives. The rule (the Non-Compete Rule)
implicates unsettled issues regarding the FTC’s authority to issue substantive competition regulations.
Lawsuits challenging the rule followed. In one of those cases, a federal district court has declared the
Non-Compete Rule unlawful and barred the FTC from enforcing it nationwide. Shortly before that
decision, another court held that a separate challenge to the rule was likely to succeed and preliminarily
enjoined the rule’s enforcement against the named plaintiff in that case. A third court has taken a more
favorable view of the Non-Compete Rule, denying a motion for a preliminary injunction and concluding
that the plaintiff had not established a reasonable probability that the rule exceeds the FTC’s legal
authority.
This Legal Sidebar provides background on the Non-Compete Rule and associated legal issues, along
with an overview of the litigation challenging it.
Background
The Non-Compete Rule
The Non-Compete Rule makes it unlawful to enter into or enforce a non-compete clause with any worker
who is not a senior executive. The rule prohibits employers from entering into non-competes with senior
executives after the rule’s effective date, but allows employers to enforce preexisting non-competes with
senior executives. The rule defines the term “senior executive” to mean a worker who occupied a
“policy-making position” and received total compensation of at least $151,164 in the preceding year.
The rule’s prohibitions are subject to an exception for non-compete clauses entered into pursuant to a
bona fide sale of a business entity, a person’s ownership interest in a business entity, or all or substantially
all of a business entity’s operating assets.
Congressional Research Service
https://crsreports.congress.gov
LSB11228
Congressional Research Service 2
The rule defines the term “non-compete clause” to mean a term or condition of employment that
“prohibits,” “penalizes,” or “functions to prevent” a worker from seeking or accepting work with a
different person after the conclusion of the employment that includes the term or condition. The rule
explains that this definition encompasses “de facto” or “functional” non-competes—for example,
“forfeiture-for-competition” clauses that extinguish an employer’s obligation to pay promised
compensation or benefits if a worker accepts another job. The rule does not, however, categorically
prohibit non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) or non-solicitation agreements.
The Non-Compete Rule defines the term “worker” to include employees and independent contractors.
That term does not include franchisees in the context of a franchisor-franchisee relationship, but does
include employees of a franchisor or franchisee.
Employers that fall outside of the FTC’s jurisdiction under the FTC Act are not subject to the rule. These
employers include certain banks, savings and loan institutions, federal credit unions, common carriers, air
carriers, and “persons, partnerships, or corporations insofar as they are subject to the Packers and
Stockyards Act.” Corporations that are not “organized to carry on business for [their] own profit or that of
[their] members” are also excluded from the FTC Act’s coverage. The rule explains that simply claiming
non-profit status under the tax code is not sufficient to qualify for this exclusion. Instead, the FTC
evaluates the economic realities of an entity’s activities to determine whether the exclusion applies.
The Non-Compete Rule requires employers to provide “clear and conspicuous notice” to workers subject
to prohibited non-compete clauses that the clauses “will not be, and cannot legally be” enforced.
Legal Authority
The FTC relied on Sections 5 and 6(g) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act) in promulgating
the Non-Compete Rule. Section 5 prohibits “unfair methods of competition” (UMC) and empowers the
FTC to enforce that prohibition through adjudication. Section 6 is titled “Additional powers of
Commission.” It confers a range of authorities, most of which involve investigations and the publication
of reports. The provision also includes Section 6(g), which empowers the FTC to “from time to time
classify corporations and . . . to make rules and regulations for the purpose of carrying out” the FTC Act.
Sections 5 and 6(g) were both part of the original FTC Act, which Congress enacted in 1914. Since the
statute’s enactment, Congress has adopted several laws granting the FTC rulemaking authority over
discrete subjects, including the Wool Products Labeling Act, the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act,
the Fur Products Labeling Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act.
The FTC first asserted that Section 6(g) endows it with general substantive rulemaking power in 1962,
and the agency adopted a number of trade regulation rules in the years that followed. Some of those rules
defined certain conduct as both a UMC and an “unfair or deceptive act or practice” (UDAP)—a separate
category of conduct prohibited by Section 5. Other rules relied only on the FTC’s UDAP power. One rule
relied solely on the FTC’s competition authority, but was never enforced and has been repealed.
In the 1970s, a trade association challenged the FTC’s authority to issue substantive rules under
Section 6(g) in National Petroleum Refiners Association v. FTC. The trade association argued that
Section 6(g) authorized only procedural rules, emphasizing that the FTC had not asserted substantive
rulemaking authority under Section 6(g) until 1962 and that FTC officials had occasionally denied the
existence of such authority. The trade association also contended that Congress’s enactment of several
statutes granting the FTC specific rulemaking authorities implied that the FTC lacked general rulemaking
authority.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected those arguments. In affirming the FTC’s power to
issue legislative rules under Section 6(g), the court relied on appellate decisions construing similar
statutes as authorizing substantive rulemaking, the advantages of rulemaking in effectuating the FTC
Congressional Research Service 3
Act’s purposes, and the absence of any limiting language in the statutory text. The D.C. Circuit
downplayed the fact that the FTC had not claimed general rulemaking authority until 1962, reasoning that
the agency’s earlier interpretation of its legal authority did not warrant judicial deference. The court also
concluded that Congress may have provided the FTC with more specific rulemaking authorities based on
“uncertainty, understandable caution, and a desire to avoid litigation,” rather than a firm conviction that
the FTC lacked general rulemaking authority.
Two years after the National Petroleum Refiners decision, Congress enacted the Magnuson-Moss Act,
which imposed special procedural requirements for the FTC’s UDAP rules and eliminated the FTC’s
authority to issue such rules under Section 6(g). Magnuson-Moss did not by its terms affect the FTC’s
authority to issue UMC rules: the statute included a provision disclaiming an intent to affect “any
authority of the Commission to prescribe rules (including interpretive rules), and general statements of
policy, with respect to unfair methods of competition.”
Despite this language in Magnuson-Moss, the FTC’s putative authority to issue UMC rules has been
dormant since the enactment of that statute. The Non-Compete Rule marks the first rule promulgated
under Section 6(g) since the 1970s and the second rule ever that relies solely upon the FTC’s competition
authority.","The D.C. Circuit rejected arguments that Section 6(g) only authorized procedural rules,  that the FTC's late assertion of substantive rulemaking power under Section 6(g) negated it, and that Congress granting the FTC specific rulemaking authorities implied it lacked general rulemaking authority.
","The U.S. Court of Appeals rejected the arguments that Section 6(g) of the FTC Act only authorized procedural rules and that the FTC's assertion of substantive rulemaking authority in 1962 was invalid. It also dismissed the argument that Congress granting specific rulemaking authorities implied the FTC lacked general rulemaking authority. The court downplayed the FTC not claiming this authority before 1962, reasoning the agency's prior interpretation didn't warrant judicial deference. Additionally, the court suggested that Congress’s specific rule authorities might result from caution and a desire to avoid litigation, rather than a lack of general rulemaking authority.","According to the text, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected two main arguments from the trade association:

1. That Section 6(g) only authorized procedural rules, not substantive ones. The trade association based this on the fact that the FTC hadn't claimed substantive rulemaking authority until 1962 and FTC officials had sometimes denied having such authority.

2. That Congress's enactment of specific rulemaking statutes implied the FTC lacked general rulemaking authority.",297,676,497,490.0
402,"To answer, forget everything you know and use only the information I provide in the context block. Provide your answer in 150 words or less. If you cannot answer using the context alone, say ""I cannot determine the answer to that due to lack of context.""","Aside from the potential loss of revenue from home distillation and the known dangers of consuming contaminated alcohol in homemade spirits, why do governments continue to prohibit the legal home production of distilled alcoholic beverages?","The dollar figures involved are informative. When alcohol is made
on a large scale, as it is for the fuel-alcohol industry (gasohol) its cost of
manufacture is about 25 cents per litre. This is for 100% alcohol. If diluted
to the 40% commonly used for vodka, gin and other distilled spirits a litre
would contain about 10 cents worth of alcohol. The retail price of a litre of
vodka will lie somewhere between $10 and $20 depending on the country
and the level of taxation. Some of the difference is due to the scale of
manufacture, the purity of the product, transportation, the profit margin, etc.
but even allowing for these factors the tax burden on the consumer is
extremely high. Is it any wonder that an unscrupulous operator will attempt
to sell his alcohol direct to the consumer, perhaps at half the normal retail
price which would still give him a very handsome profit? Or is it any
wonder that the authorities crack down hard on anyone attempting to
interfere with their huge source of revenue, their milch cow?
This battle between illicit alcohol producers (moon-shiners) or
importers (smugglers) and the authorities has now become the stuff of
legend. Consider the number of stories written or movies made about
desperate men rolling barrels of rum up a beach at midnight! Or about the
battles between gangsters and police during prohibition days in the United
States! Unfortunately, such stories have been taken too much to heart by the
general public so that the whole idea of distillation, and the spirits made by
this process, is now perceived as being inherently more wicked than the
gentle art of beer- or wine-making. And the “wickedness” is a strong
deterrent to most people.
18
It is understandable why a government would wish to put a stop to
smuggling and moonshining for commercial purposes, that is to say in order
to re-sell the product and avoid the payment of taxes. But why would there
be a complete ban on distillation by amateurs, on a small scale and for their
own use? At the risk of being tediously repetitious it is worth reminding
ourselves again (and again) that distillation is one of the most innocuous
activities imaginable. It doesn't produce a drop of alcohol. Not a drop.
What it does is take the beer which you have quite legally made by
fermentation and remove all the noxious, poisonous substances which
appear inevitably as by-products in all fermentations. Far from making
alcohol, a little will actually be lost during this purification process. Instead
of prohibiting it, the authorities should really be encouraging distillation by
amateurs. And the general public, which is so rightly health-conscious these
days, would be more than justified in demanding the right to do so.
In attempting to find the reason for governments to ban the
purification of beer or wine by distillation the first thing which comes to
mind is the potential loss of revenue. After all, if everyone started making
their own spirits at home the loss of revenue could be considerable. But this
cannot be the real reason because the home production of beer and wine for
one's own use is legal, and both are taxable when sold commercially, so the
authorities must not be all that concerned about the loss of revenue when
people make their own alcoholic beverages.
A possible, and somewhat cynical, explanation for the prohibition of
home distillation is based on the following reasoning: Home-made beer and
wine are usually so inferior to a good commercial product that only the most
dedicated amateurs will go to the trouble of first making and then drinking
such doubtful concoctions. Consequently, there is no real threat to the sale
of commercial products nor to the revenues generated by taxation. If,
however, home distillation were permitted, every Tom, Dick and Harriette
would be in a position to make a gin or vodka which was every bit as good
as the finest commercial product on the market. This could, it might be
argued, make serious inroads into commercial sales and into government
revenues.
Further thought, however, makes it very unlikely that amateur
production of spirits would have any appreciable effect on commercial sales.
For one thing the equipment is moderately expensive and it is necessary to
follow directions rather carefully when using it so it is unlikely that the
19
practice would ever become really widespread. Moreover, many people
prefer scotch, rye, rum, etc. to gin and vodka and it is only the latter which
can be made safely and effectively by the amateur. So, if distillation were
legalized for amateurs, it would probably become nothing more than an
interesting hobby, just like making wine, and offer little competition to
commercial producers.
No, we have to look deeper than this in our search for a reason why
governments have a hang-up about distillation. You see, it is not just
amateurs who are penalized. Commercial producers also feel the heavy hand
of government prejudice and disapproval. This is illustrated by several
restrictions which apply in many countries. One is the fact that the
advertising of beer and wine on television is permitted whereas the
advertising of distilled spirits is prohibited. Another concerns the tax
imposed on distilled alcoholic products --- per unit of alcohol the tax on the
distilled product is much higher than it is on beer and wine. A third
restriction on spirits can be seen in the alcoholic beverage section of
supermarkets ---- beer and wine are sold, and possibly fortified wines such
as vermouth, but raise the alcohol concentration to 40% and the ancient
shibboleth of 'hard spirits' reigns supreme. This is grossly unfair
discrimination and naturally of great concern to distillers. As they point out,
a glass of gin and tonic, a glass of wine, and a bottle of beer all contain
similar amounts of alcohol, so it is inequitable to tax their product at a
higher level.
So just why is there this official discrimination against distilled
alcoholic beverages? Irrational attitudes are always difficult to deal with,
but in order to reform the law we have to deal with it, and this requires that
we try to understand the thinking behind it. The drug involved is ethyl
alcohol, an acknowledged mood-modifier, but ethyl alcohol itself is not
singled out by governments as being the bad actor. The alcohol in beer,
wine and gin are identical and imbibed in similar quantities will have
identical effects in terms of mood modification. No, apparently distillation
per se is perceived as evil, to the point where even owning the equipment is
illegal.
There is only one explanation which seems to fit all the facts and this
is that governments and their officials fail to make a distinction between
concentration and amount. Actually, quite a lot of people have this problem.
Just because beer has 5% alcohol and gin has 40% does not mean that the
20
gin-drinker is eight times more likely to over-indulge than the beer drinker.
The fact of the matter is that anti-social behaviour such as hooliganism at
sporting events is invariably caused by beer drinkers. And many studies of
drinking and driving have shown that the vast majority of those pulled over
have been drinking beer, not spirits. People drink until they've had enough,
or feel in a certain mood, and if this takes five, ten, or even more beers then
that is the number which will be drunk. It is the testosterone concentration
which causes the problem, not the alcohol concentration.
A few attempts have been made to dig deeper into the reasons behind
the official attitude to distillation but it is a frustrating experience.
Invariably the person spoken to seems bewildered by the question, almost as
though one had asked why it was illegal to murder someone. One individual
explained patiently and kindly that it was because the law is the law.
Another made the extraordinary statement that distillation was prohibited
because it makes alcohol and this is illegal. (Of course distillation does not
make alcohol. Alcohol is made by fermentation, not by distillation, and in
any case fermentation to make beer and wine for one's own consumption is
completely legal).","Governments seem to believe, incorrectly, that higher alcohol concentration in distilled spirits leads to more social problems like hooliganism and drunk driving.  They fail to understand that people drink for effect, not concentration, meaning someone will drink multiple beers to achieve the same effect as a smaller quantity of a higher-proof beverage.  This misunderstanding likely stems from a general public perception of distilled spirits as ""wicked,"" possibly due to the historical association of distillation with smuggling and organized crime.
",I cannot determine the answer to that due to lack of context.,"Based solely on the provided context, governments continue to prohibit home distillation due to an apparent irrational prejudice against distillation itself and a failure to distinguish between concentration and amount of alcohol. The text suggests that officials mistakenly perceive distillation as inherently ""evil"" or ""wicked,"" influenced by cultural legends and prohibition-era stories. This perception persists despite evidence that distillation actually purifies alcohol rather than produces it, and despite the fact that distilled spirits don't lead to more alcohol-related problems than beer or wine. The context indicates this is not primarily about revenue loss, as governments allow home brewing of beer and wine, which could similarly impact tax revenue. Instead, it appears to be an ingrained, irrational bias that has become institutionalized in law and policy.",554,61,875,496.6666666666667
420,"You must answer based solely on the information provided, no outside information is allowed.",What caused the boat to sink?,"December 24, the day Peterson said he was fishing, was gray, damp, and cold with a bit of wind. Few people were at the Berkeley Marina. When questioned by police, Peterson would not say what he was hoping to catch, but the fishing searches performed from his computer earlier in the month had included searches relating to sturgeon and striped bass. Angelo Cuanang, a published author on fishing in the San Francisco Bay who was accepted by the court as an expert fisherman, testified that Brooks Island was the wrong place to seek sturgeon, which congregated in a different part of the bay that time of year. Sturgeon also preferred live bait to lures, and Peterson’s rod was too weak to catch them. Anchoring was essential to reel in sturgeon; the homemade cement anchor in his boat would have been inadequate. Finally, it was illegal to troll for sturgeon, as Peterson claimed to have done. Peterson’s
lures and the time of year he was fishing were also wrong for catching striped bass. The prosecution’s theory was as follows: Peterson killed Laci sometime on the night of December 23 or morning of December 24. On the morning of the 24th, Peterson let their dog McKenzie out with his leash on to make it appear something had happened while Laci was walking him. He wrapped Laci’s body in a tarp in the bed of his truck, covered her with the patio umbrellas, drove to the warehouse, and then moved her body into his boat.  He drove to the Berkeley Marina, motored out to an area near Brooks Island, and slipped her body, attached to homemade concrete weights like the homemade anchor Peterson had made, into the bay.  Peterson then returned to Modesto, dropped off the boat at the warehouse, put the boat cover out back under a leaky gas blower so that any scent would be obscured, washed his clothes, and proceeded with the ruse that Laci was missing, hoping her body would never be discovered. The defense argued the police had not diligently pursued whether a person or persons other than Peterson were more likely responsible for Laci’s disappearance and murder. The defense presented evidence that a burglary had occurred on the Petersons’ street the week of her disappearance and argued that the police failed adequately to follow up on whether that burglary had any connection to Laci’s disappearance. It also presented evidence that a stranger had gone to several houses on December 23 asking for money and, one neighbor thought, casing houses for burglaries, and so might have had something to do with her disappearance. Testimony was presented thatthe same neighbor, walking with a police officer on Christmas Day to look for the stranger, had seen a pair of sandals lying in the road 150 feet from the Petersons’ home; the neighbor wondered at the time if they might have any connection to Laci’s disappearance, but the officer just left them there. To support the possibility of a third party’s involvement, the defense challenged the prosecution’s theory that Conner died December 23 or 24, presenting its own expert who testified based on ultrasounds and other evidence that Conner lived until after Christmas.The defense also sought to challenge other aspects of the prosecution’s case. To rebut the dog-trailing evidence, the defense called Ronald Seitz, a second dog handler who also had his dog try to find Laci’s scent at the Berkeley Marina on December 28. The dog, T.J., was given Laci’s slipper as a scent object, but discovered no scent trail. To rebut the inference that Peterson had a financial incentive to kill Laci, the defense presented a financial expert who testified that TradeCorp U.S.A. and the Petersons were both reasonably financially healthy. To portray the prosecution’s theory as physically impossible, the defense also sought to introduce video of a demonstration with a weighted 150-pound dummy in a boat on the bay in which a defense firm employee, trying to dump the dummy out, sank the boat. As will be discussed below, the trial court excluded the video. The defense offered explanations for the circumstances of Peterson’s behavior in April. His use of his mother’s name to purchase a car was at her suggestion, to avoid having it impounded. He had large amounts of cash because she gave it to him to reimburse him for money erroneously withdrawn from his bank account rather than hers. Finally, he had his brother’s driver’s license because the club where he was going to golf that day gave discounts for local residents such as his brother. The jury found Peterson guilty of murder in the first degree for killing Laci and murder in the second degree for killing Conner. (See Pen. Code, §§ 187, 189.) It found true the sole charged special circumstance, for multiple murder. Peterson had no criminal record nor any history of violent acts. At the penalty phase, the prosecution relied exclusively on the circumstances of the crime and victim impact evidence. Four members of Laci’s immediate family — her mother, Sharon; her stepfather, Ron Grantski; her brother, Brent; and her sister, Amy — testified. They described who Laci was as a person, shared photographs, memories, and vignettes from her life, and conveyed the grief and loss they each felt after the deaths of Laci and her unborn child. Through friends, family, neighbors, teachers, coworkers, employers, and other witnesses, the defense offered evidence that Peterson had been a kind and positive member of the community. Peterson grew up in a loving family, displayed a patient and gentle disposition, and was a solid student. As part of his high school community service requirement, Peterson worked at a home for the elderly and tutored homeless children. He started his own business and worked a variety of other jobs while in college. According to the defense, Peterson was always calm with Laci. Indeed, witnesses testified Peterson was calm at all times — at work, on the golf course, and in his dealings with all those around him. Friends and family testified to the impact the trial had had on Peterson’s relatives and indicated they believed, if sentenced to life in prison, Peterson could make a positive impact on the lives of others.

Abstract

Background
Previous studies have documented the cardiometabolic health benefits of plant‐based diets; however, these studies were conducted in selected study populations that had narrow generalizability.

Methods and Results
We used data from a community‐based cohort of middle‐aged adults (n=12 168) in the ARIC (Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities) study who were followed up from 1987 through 2016. Participants’ diet was classified using 4 diet indexes. In the overall plant‐based diet index and provegetarian diet index, higher intakes of all or selected plant foods received higher scores; in the healthy plant‐based diet index, higher intakes of only the healthy plant foods received higher scores; in the less healthy plant‐based diet index, higher intakes of only the less healthy plant foods received higher scores. In all indexes, higher intakes of animal foods received lower scores. Results from Cox proportional hazards models showed that participants in the highest versus lowest quintile for adherence to overall plant‐based diet index or provegetarian diet had a 16%, 31% to 32%, and 18% to 25% lower risk of cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease mortality, and all‐cause mortality, respectively, after adjusting for important confounders (all P<0.05 for trend). Higher adherence to a healthy plant‐based diet index was associated with a 19% and 11% lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality and all‐cause mortality, respectively, but not incident cardiovascular disease (P<0.05 for trend). No associations were observed between the less healthy plant‐based diet index and the outcomes.

Conclusions
Diets higher in plant foods and lower in animal foods were associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in a general population.


Clinical Perspective

What Is New?
    • Plant‐based diets, diets that emphasize higher intakes of plant foods and lower intakes of animal foods, are associated with a lower risk of incident cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease mortality, and all‐cause mortality in a general US adult population.
    • Healthful plant‐based diets, diets higher in nutrient‐dense plant foods and lower in refined carbohydrates and animal foods, are associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease mortality and all‐cause mortality, but not incident cardiovascular disease.

What Are the Clinical Implications?
    • Our results suggest that dietary patterns that are relatively higher in plant foods and relatively lower in animal foods may confer benefits for cardiovascular health.
    • Future research examining whether the quality of plant foods (healthful versus less healthful) within the framework of an overall plant‐based diet is associated with cardiovascular disease and all‐cause mortality is warranted.

Introduction
Plant‐based diets are dietary patterns that emphasize higher intakes of plant foods and are low in animal foods. Vegetarian diets, a type of plant‐based diet, with a focus on restriction of different types of animal foods (meat, poultry, or fish), have been associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular risk factors, such as obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and ischemic heart disease.1, 2, 3 However, prospective cohort studies have shown mixed results on the associations with cardiovascular disease mortality and all‐cause mortality.4, 5, 6 These previous studies were conducted in selected study populations that were mostly composed of Seventh‐Day Adventists, vegetarians, or health‐conscious individuals; thus, they had relatively narrow generalizability.4, 5, 7, 8, 9
Although prior studies have characterized participants’ diets using a relatively simple classification method based on frequency of animal food consumption,4, 5, 6 there have since been more comprehensive attempts to assess an individual's diet using plant‐based diet indexes.10, 11, 12, 13 These indexes give higher scores for higher consumption of plant foods and lower consumption of animal foods, allowing researchers to examine whether the degree of adherence to an overall plant‐based diet is associated with health outcomes. Studies that used such indexes (ie, an overall plant‐based diet index [PDI] or a provegetarian diet index) found that greater adherence to these diets was associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, and all‐cause mortality.10, 11, 12 In addition, some plant‐based indexes separately scored healthful (whole grains, vegetables, and plant proteins) and unhealthful (refined carbohydrates and sugar) plant sources of food. Healthful plant‐based diets, which scored higher intakes of only healthful plant foods higher, were more strongly inversely associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease than the overall plant‐based diets.11, 12 In contrast, greater adherence to less healthful (unhealthful) plant‐based diets, which scored higher intakes of only less healthful plant foods higher, were associated with a higher risk of these conditions.11, 12
Given the limited evidence on plant‐based diets in the general population and recent developments in plant‐based diet scores, the objectives of the present study were as follows: (1) to evaluate whether overall plant‐based diets are associated with a lower risk of incident cardiovascular disease, cardiovascular disease mortality, and all‐cause mortality in a general US population; and (2) to assess if the association differed by adherence to healthful and less healthful plant‐based diets using 4 a priori defined plant‐based diet scores (overall plant‐based diet, healthy plant‐based diet, less healthy plant‐based diet, and provegetarian diet indexes).

Study Design
We used data from a community‐based cohort of middle‐aged men and women (45–64 years of age at baseline, n=15 792) in the ARIC study. From 1987 to 1989, participants from 4 US communities (Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; Minneapolis, MN; and Jackson, MS) were enrolled in the study. Follow‐up visits occurred in 1990 to 1992 (visit 2), 1993 to 1995 (visit 3), 1996 to 1998 (visit 4), 2011 to 2013 (visit 5), and 2016 to 2017 (visit 6).14 The Institutional Review Board at each study site approved the study protocol, and participants provided informed consent.

Dietary Assessment
At baseline and visit 3, participants’ usual intake of foods and beverages was assessed by trained interviewers using a modified version of the 66‐item semiquantitative Willett food frequency questionnaire. Participants indicated the frequency with which they consumed foods and beverages of a defined serving size in the previous year. Visual guides, such as glasses and measuring cups, were provided for participants to estimate portion size. The reliability of the food frequency questionnaire was assessed in a random sample of ARIC study participants (n=419) from all 4 study sites at visit 2.15 Nutrient and total energy intakes were derived through multiplying consumption of food by nutrient content of each item in the food frequency questionnaire.

Plant‐Based Diet Scores
The ARIC study did not assess whether participants were following a plant‐based diet. We used established plant‐based diet scores (PDI, healthy plant‐based diet index [hPDI], less healthy [unhealthy] plant‐based diet index [uPDI], and provegetarian diet index) to assess participants’ degree of adherence to plant‐based diets on the basis of their reported dietary intake on the food frequency questionnaire. We used these 4 plant‐based diet indexes to provide comprehensive and nuanced characterization of dietary intakes because the indexes differed from each other in scoring of food groups within the indexes. For instance, the PDI was more comprehensive than the provegetarian index in that the PDI assessed dietary intakes of plant foods high in refined carbohydrates (fruit juices, sugar‐sweetened beverages, sweets, and desserts). Consistent with some ethically motivated dietary patterns that are focused on the exclusion of animal sources of food and have less of an emphasis on the quality of plant foods, the provegetarian diet index provides a more simplistic score of the diet in that these refined carbohydrate food groups were not assessed. Further details on differences and construction of the scores have been published previously and are available in Data S1.10, 11, 12, 13, 16
The PDI, hPDI, and uPDI had a possible range from 17 to 85, and the provegetarian diet index had a possible range from 11 to 55. All scores were divided into quintiles for analyses.

Outcome Assessment
Incident cardiovascular disease events and deaths (cardiovascular and all cause) were ascertained through annual telephone calls with participants or proxies, active surveillance of local hospital discharge records and state death records, and linkage to the National Death Index from baseline to December 31, 2016. Incident cardiovascular disease was defined as a composite outcome of coronary heart disease, stroke, and heart failure. Incident coronary heart disease was defined as hospitalized myocardial infarction or fatal coronary heart disease.17 Incident stroke was defined as definite or probable stroke, which was adjudicated.18 Incident heart failure was defined as hospitalization or death, with International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD‐9), code 428 or International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD‐10), code I50.19 All‐cause mortality was defined as deaths attributable to any cause, and cardiovascular disease mortality was defined as deaths with ICD‐9 codes 390 to 459 or ICD‐10 codes I00 to I99.

Covariate Assessment
At baseline, participants’ sociodemographic information (age, sex, race/ethnicity, and education), health behaviors (cigarette smoking, frequency and duration of physical activity, alcohol intake, and margarine intake), medication use (lipid‐lowering medication use, antihypertensive medication use, or diabetes mellitus medication use), and health conditions (diagnosis of diseases) were collected by self‐reports.
Trained staff measured participants’ weight and height, which was used to calculate body mass index (BMI; kg/m2). Those whose BMI was ≤25 kg/m2 were classified as normal weight, those whose BMI was from 25 to <30 kg/m2 were classified as overweight, and those whose BMI was ≥30 kg/m2 were classified as obese. An enzymatic method was used to measure total cholesterol concentration.20 A certified technician measured participants’ blood pressure 3 times, and the second and third measurements were averaged. The modified hexokinase/glucose‐6‐phosphate dehydrogenase method was used to measure blood glucose concentrations. Baseline kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate) was estimated from serum creatinine measurement using the 2009 Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation.21 We defined hypertension as systolic blood pressure of ≥140 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure of ≥90 mm Hg, or antihypertensive medication use in the past 2 weeks. We defined diabetes mellitus as fasting glucose concentration of ≥126 mg/dL, nonfasting blood glucose concentration of ≥200 mg/dL, self‐reported physician's diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, or diabetes mellitus medication use in the past 2 weeks.","The four plant-based diet indexes are:

Do not use bullet points.  Limit your response to 100 words.,How do regulators' powers achieve their goals?,"Regulatory Powers
Regulators implement policy using their powers, which vary by agency. Powers, which can also 
be thought of as tools, can be grouped into a few broad categories:
• Licensing, chartering, or registration. A starting point for understanding the 
regulatory system is that most activities cannot be undertaken unless a firm, 
individual, or market has received the proper credentials from the appropriate 
state or federal regulator. Each type of charter, license, or registration granted by 
the respective regulator governs the sets of financial activities that the holder is 
permitted to engage in. For example, a firm cannot accept federally insured 
3 U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO), Financial Regulation, GAO-16-175, February 2016, 
https://www.gao.gov/assets/680/675400.pdf.

deposits unless it is chartered as a bank, thrift, or credit union by a depository 
institution regulator. Likewise, an individual generally cannot buy and sell 
securities to others unless licensed as a broker-dealer.4 To be granted a license, 
charter, or registration, the recipient must accept the terms and conditions that 
accompany it. Depending on the type, those conditions could include regulatory 
oversight, training requirements, and a requirement to act according to a set of 
standards or code of ethics. Failure to meet the terms and conditions could result 
in fines, penalties, remedial actions, license or charter revocation, or criminal 
charges.
• Rulemaking. Regulators issue rules (regulations) through the rulemaking 
process to implement statutory mandates.5 Typically, statutory mandates provide 
regulators with a policy goal in general terms, and regulations fill in the specifics. 
Rules lay out the guidelines for how market participants may or may not act to 
comply with the mandate.
• Oversight and supervision. Regulators ensure that their rules are adhered to 
through oversight and supervision. This allows regulators to observe market 
participants’ behavior and instruct them to modify or cease improper behavior. 
Supervision may entail active, ongoing monitoring (as for banks) or investigating 
complaints and allegations ex post (as is common in securities markets). In some 
cases, such as banking, supervision includes periodic examinations and 
inspections, whereas in other cases, regulators rely more heavily on selfreporting. Regulators explain supervisory priorities and points of emphasis by 
issuing supervisory letters and guidance. 
• Enforcement. Regulators can compel firms to modify their behavior through 
enforcement powers. Enforcement powers include the ability to issue fines, 
penalties, and cease-and-desist orders; to undertake criminal or civil actions in 
court or administrative proceedings or arbitrations; and to revoke licenses and 
charters. In some cases, regulators initiate legal action at their own prompting or 
in response to consumer or investor complaints. In other cases, regulators 
explicitly allow consumers and investors to sue for damages when firms do not 
comply with regulations, or they provide legal protection to firms that do comply.
• Resolution. Some regulators have the power to resolve a failing firm by taking 
control of the firm and initiating conservatorship (i.e., the regulator runs the firm 
on an ongoing basis) or receivership (i.e., the regulator winds the firm down). 
Other types of failing financial firms are resolved through bankruptcy, a judicial 
process separate from the regulators.
Goals of Regulation
Financial regulation is primarily intended to achieve the following underlying policy outcomes:6
• Market efficiency and integrity. Regulators seek to ensure that markets operate 
efficiently and that market participants have confidence in the market’s integrity. 
4 One may obtain separate licenses to be a broker or a dealer, but in practice, many obtain both.
5 For more information, see CRS Report R41546, A Brief Overview of Rulemaking and Judicial Review, by Todd 
Garvey.
6 Regulators are also tasked with promoting certain social goals, such as community reinvestment or affordable 
housing. Because this report focuses on regulation, it will not discuss social goals.
Who Regulates Whom? An Overview of the U.S. Financial Regulatory Framework

Liquidity, low costs, the presence of many buyers and sellers, the availability of 
information, and a lack of excessive volatility are examples of the characteristics 
of an efficient market. Regulation can also improve market efficiency by 
addressing market failures, such as principal-agent problems,7
asymmetric 
information,8
and moral hazard.9 Regulators contribute to market integrity by 
ensuring that activities are transparent, contracts can be enforced, and the “rules 
of the game” they set are enforced. Integrity generally leads to greater efficiency.
• Consumer and investor protection. Regulators seek to ensure that consumers or 
investors do not suffer from fraud, discrimination, manipulation, and theft. 
Regulators try to prevent exploitative or abusive practices intended to take 
advantage of unwitting consumers or investors. In some cases, protection is 
limited to enabling consumers and investors to understand the inherent risks 
when they enter into a transaction. In other cases, protection is based on the 
principle of suitability—efforts to ensure that more risky products or product 
features are accessible only to financially sophisticated or secure consumers or 
investors.
• Capital formation and access to credit. Regulators seek to ensure that firms 
and consumers are able to access credit and capital to meet their needs such that 
credit and economic activity can grow at a healthy rate. Regulators try to ensure 
that capital and credit are available to all worthy borrowers, regardless of 
personal characteristics, such as race, gender, and location. Examples are fair 
lending laws and fair housing goals.
• Illicit activity prevention. Regulators seek to ensure that the financial system 
cannot be used to support criminal and terrorist activity. Examples are policies to 
prevent money laundering, tax evasion, terrorism financing, and the 
contravention of financial sanctions.
• Taxpayer protection. Regulators seek to ensure that losses or failures in 
financial markets do not result in federal government payouts or the assumption 
of liabilities that are ultimately borne by taxpayers. Only certain types of 
financial activity are explicitly backed by the federal government or by regulatorrun insurance schemes that are backed by the federal government, such as the 
Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) run by the FDIC. Such schemes are self-financed 
by the insured firms through premium payments unless the losses exceed the 
insurance fund, in which case taxpayer money is used temporarily or 
permanently to fill the gap. In the case of a financial crisis, the government may 
decide that the “least bad” option is to provide funds in ways not explicitly 
promised or previously contemplated to restore stability. “Bailouts” of large 
failing firms in 2008 are the most well-known examples. In this sense,  there may 
be implicit taxpayer backing of parts or all of the financial system.
• Financial stability. Financial regulation seeks to maintain financial stability 
through preventive and palliative measures that mitigate systemic risk. At times, 
financial markets stop functioning well—markets freeze, participants panic, 
7 For example, financial agents may have incentives to make decisions that are not in the best interests of their clients, 
and clients may not be able to adequately monitor their behavior.
8 For example, firms issuing securities know more about their financial prospects than do investors purchasing those 
securities, which can result in a “lemons” problem in which low-quality firms drive high-quality firms out of the 
marketplace.
9 For example, individuals may act more imprudently if they are insured against a risk.
Who Regulates Whom? An Overview of the U.S. Financial Regulatory Framework
Congressional Research Service 5
credit becomes unavailable, and multiple firms fail. Financial instability can be 
localized (to a specific market or activity) or more general. Sometimes instability 
can be contained and quelled through market actions or policy intervention; at 
other times, instability metastasizes and does broader damage to the real 
economy. The most recent example of the latter was the financial crisis of 2007-
2009. Traditionally, financial stability concerns have centered on banking, but the 
recent crisis illustrates the potential for systemic risk to arise in other parts of the 
financial system as well.
These regulatory goals are sometimes complementary but at other times conflict with each other. 
For example, without an adequate level of consumer and investor protections, fewer individuals 
may be willing to participate in financial markets, and efficiency and capital formation could 
suffer. But, at some point, too many consumer and investor safeguards and protections could 
make credit and capital prohibitively expensive, reducing market efficiency and capital formation. 
Regulation generally aims to seek a middle ground between these two extremes in which 
regulatory burden is as small as possible and regulatory benefits are as large as possible. Because 
some firms can cope with regulatory burden better than others can, sometimes regulation is 
tailored so that smaller firms, for example, are exempted from a regulation or face a streamlined 
version of a regulation. As a result, when taking any action, regulators balance the tradeoffs 
between their various goals.","Regulators use licensing to control market entry and set basic operating standards, promoting market integrity and consumer protection. Rulemaking establishes specific guidelines for behavior, supporting market efficiency and preventing illicit activity. Oversight and enforcement ensure compliance with these rules, furthering efficiency, integrity, and consumer/investor protection. Resolution powers, like conservatorship, aim to limit taxpayer exposure from firm failures and maintain financial stability.  These powers work in concert to balance competing goals such as capital formation and consumer protection.
","Regulators' powers are designed to implement and achieve financial regulatory goals like market efficiency, consumer protection, and financial stability. Licensing, chartering, and registration ensure that only qualified entities engage in regulated activities, meeting standards that promote integrity and trust. Rulemaking fills in details for statutory mandates, guiding participant behavior to align with policy goals. Oversight and supervision ensure compliance with regulations, addressing potential issues proactively or reactively. Enforcement powers allow regulators to compel compliance and address violations through fines and legal actions. Resolution powers help manage failing firms to prevent systemic instability, protecting taxpayers and maintaining market confidence.","Based on the provided text, regulators use five main powers to achieve their goals: licensing/chartering, rulemaking, oversight/supervision, enforcement, and resolution. These powers work together to promote market efficiency, protect consumers, enable capital formation, prevent illicit activity, protect taxpayers, and maintain financial stability. Through licensing, regulators control who can participate in financial activities. Rulemaking establishes specific guidelines for compliance. Supervision ensures rules are followed. Enforcement compels proper behavior through fines and penalties. Resolution powers allow regulators to handle failing firms. These tools help balance regulatory burden while achieving desired policy outcomes.",618,785,741,714.6666666666666

416,"Only use the context provided to you, never use the information you have stored in your system already. ",What factors are used in order to determine stare decisis? ,"THE AMERICAN LEGAL
SYSTEM MADE EASY
Chapter 1 discussed the software of the American lawyer (i.e., in terms of the thinking
process operating within the minds of U.S.-licensed legal professionals). This chapter,
in contrast, examines the hardware in terms of the conceptual component parts within
the software of the American lawyer and legal system. Specifically, the hardware is
based in part on the black letter law embedded within the American legal infrastructure,
which this chapter will now briefly overview.
Common Law Versus Other Domestic Laws
American law is based on common law from the United Kingdom as one of its core legal
pillars (which is then buttressed by, among other sources, the U.S. Constitution, court
cases, statutes, restatements, decrees, treatises, and various other rules and regulations).
Common law follows the principle of stare decisis (Latin, meaning “stand by your
decision”). Stare decisis is a legal principle stating that prior court decisions (e.g.,
holdings, conclusions, rulings) must be recognized as precedent case law. If a case is
deemed a precedent case, then lower courts are compelled to rule in the same way as
the precedent case. This applies only if the precedent case is binding or mandatory.
The rationale for stare decisis and precedent cases is judicial efficiency, fairness to the
parties, predictability, and a check and balance on arbitrary behavior.
In common law countries, juries and oral arguments by lawyers often can take a
greater or more visible role compared to in civil law countries (which may not have
jury trials), in which the judge can play a more central and prominent role (of course,
exceptions can exist).

American Law 101
Examples of jurisdictions that use the common law system include the following:
• United Kingdom except Scotland
• United States except Louisiana
• Ireland
• Former British colony and/or Commonwealth territories/countries, including India except Goa, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Canada except
Quebec
• Pakistan
• Bangladesh
In contrast, generally under civil law (derived from the French-German legal tradition), statutes and other similar legal sources represent relatively greater legal authority
than does case law. Under civil law, neither precedent cases nor stare decisis exist. The
rationale for this is greater judicial freedom to decide cases on a case-by-case basis.
Some people argue, however, that this system may come at the cost of less predictability and consistency regarding case law conclusions (with similar legal issues and/or
facts).
Examples of jurisdictions that use the civil law system include the following:
• Most European Union (EU) nations, including Germany and France where civil
law was derived, but not the United Kingdom, Ireland, or Cyprus
• Most of continental Latin America except Guyana and Belize
• Congo
• Azerbaijan
• Iraq
• Russia
• Turkey
• Egypt
• Madagascar
• Lebanon
• Switzerland
• Indonesia
• Vietnam
• Thailand
The factors used in determining whether to apply stare decisis include the following:
• Similarity of legal issue(s)/legal principle(s)
• Whether the precedent case was ruled on by a court recognized as a leading one
in the relevant subject area

The American Legal System Made Easy
• Whether the precedent case was well-reasoned and articulated (in the court’s
legal opinion)
• Whether the precedent case was issued from a court in the same jurisdiction
• Whether the precedent case was issued from a higher-level court
Although these factors are often considered to determine whether a case is a precedent case, thus representing a binding and mandatory legal source, a court may not be
required to follow:
• Secondary legal sources (i.e., nonprecedent cases, not related to the U.S. Constitution, and the like; see the following paragraph for further specifics)
• Cases that do not align with these factors to determine the precedential value of
a case
Two main types of legal sources exist in American law: primary and secondary.
1. Primary legal sources include the following:
• U.S. Constitution
• Statutes
• Rules, regulations, and orders
• Executive orders and proclamations
• Case law
2. Secondary legal sources include the following:
• Treatises
• Restatements
• Law review journals
• American Law Reports
• Hornbooks
• Legal encyclopedias
A general hierarchy also exists in which federal legal sources are weighed more
heavily than state legal sources:
A. Federal Legal Sources
• U.S. Constitution
• Federal statutes and treaties
• Federal rules and regulations
• Federal cases
B. State Legal Sources
• State constitutions
• State statutes

American Law 101
• State rules and regulations
• State law cases
From this list, two interesting points arise: (1) the U.S. Constitution represents the
supreme law of the land, and (2) a federal supremacy rule applies. This means that
federal sources are generally higher than state sources in the legal source hierarchy.
This is important to know for both academics and practitioners to determine what legal
source should be given greater weight relative to others, which can help in the legal
strategy process.
State Law
Although the United States is one country, from a legal perspective, each individual
state within it has a certain level of discretion to determine what types of laws best fit
that particular state’s set of circumstances. The concept of dualism, in which sources
of law exist dually at both the federal and state level, is based in part on the view that
decentralization of power is needed. The intent of dualism was to provide greater security that one central source of authority would not become overly powerful—as was the
case with England at the time of the founding of the United States.
Furthermore, as Chapter 6 discusses in greater detail regarding Constitutional
Law, the U.S. Constitution (the nation’s highest legal authority) has embedded in
it a concept known as the enumerated powers doctrine. In the enumerated powers
doctrine, the federal government has only those powers expressly conveyed to it
under the Constitution (under Article I, Section 8), with all other remaining powers
generally belonging to the states.
Thus, state laws are actually much more widely encompassing than many people
from non–common law countries would expect. With this in mind, each specific state’s
law can vary and be different from other state laws. Although diversity exists, many
state laws are based on certain standardized laws.
Examples of standardized laws that state law can be based on include the following:
• Restatements of law, which are used to provide clarity on certain law matters
• Prepared by the American Law Institute (ALI)
• Represents secondary (nonprimary) legal source/authority
• Uniform acts/Uniform codes, such as the Uniform Commercial Code, or UCC,
relating to contract law
• Drafted by the Uniform Law Commissioners
• Body of lawyers and other legal professionals whose objective is to standardize laws across the various U.S. states
• Offered as legal models, which each state can ratify in whole or in part

The American Legal System Made Easy
• Model penal code (MPC), relating to criminal law matters
• Prepared by the ALI, much like restatements
• Objective of updating and standardizing penal law across the various U.S.
states
• MPC represents what the ALI deems as the best rules for the U.S. penal
system
Much like the dual federal-state level of legal sources, a similar dual system of
federal-state court systems exists. Consistent with the principle of federalism, federal
courts rank higher in the judicial court hierarchy relative to state courts.
The Federal Court hierarchy (from highest to lowest) is as follows:
• U.S. Supreme Court
• Circuit courts
• District courts
Federal courts consider the following legal sources:
• Federal (nonstate) statutory issues
Supreme Court of
the United States
U.S. Courts of Appeal
(13 Circuit Courts)
U.S. District Courts
(94 Trial Courts)
State Supreme Courts
Intermediate Appellate Courts
(39 of 50 States)
State Trial Courts
(Across 50 States)

American Law 101
• Diversity cases, such as cases involving parties from two different states
• Cases in which the United States is a party as plaintiff or defendant
• Other cases as specified by law (e.g., admiralty, antitrust, maritime)
• Removal jurisdiction cases, in which the defendant requests the case to be heard
by a federal, rather than a state, court in the same district
The U.S. Supreme Court (USSC) is the highest court in the United States. The U.S.
Supreme Court generally hears cases based on appeal (when certiorari—or in plain
English, review—is granted to review the case). In other words, the USSC is only in
rare circumstances the court of first instance having original jurisdiction over a case.
Of course, exceptions exist when an issue is particularly urgent. For instance, the Bush
v. Gore (2000) case was heard by the USSC at first instance because its ruling could, in
effect, determine the outcome of the 2000 U.S. presidential election.
Below the USSC in judicial hierarchy are the federal circuit courts. The circuit
courts generally hear appeals from the lower district courts. Unlike the USSC, federal
circuit courts have original jurisdiction (court of first instance) over orders of certain
federal agencies. The federal circuit courts are divided geographically into 13 circuit
courts. Circuit courts numbered from 1 to 13 encompass all of the states (including
Hawaii), with an additional district for Washington D.C. (which is a federal territory,
not a U.S. state), and a federal circuit for certain specialized matters.
Many cases begin at the state court level and, if needed, are appealed to the federal level (except for the instances discussed previously), in particular, when a federal
(rather than a state) issue arises.
State Courts
Most state court systems replicate the federal court system. Some state courts have three
levels of hierarchy, whereas other state courts have two levels of hierarchy. Regardless,
each state court has its own rules of procedure and set of practices.
With a three-level state court system, the hierarchy is typically the following:
• State Supreme Court: Hears appeals from state intermediate court
• State court of appeals: Hears appeals from lower trial court
• State trial court: Conducts fact-finding as well as ruling on the legal issue(s)
presented
State courts usually can review almost any case, but exceptions exist, such as where
jurisdiction is precluded by (1) federal statute; (2) the U.S. Constitution; or (3) other
legal source, expressly (e.g., admiralty, patent, copyright) or implicitly (e.g., antitrust
damages and injunction).

The American Legal System Made Easy
American Judicial System
The United States has three branches of government: (1) the legislative branch (the
Congress, which is composed of the Senate and House of Representatives); (2) the
executive branch (including the U.S. President), and (3) the judicial branch (including
the USSC and other courts). The three branches of government are based on the concept of checks and balances, so that each branch of government does not become too
powerful relative to the other two branches.
Related terms are defined as follows:
• Congress: Bicameral institution that refers to the Senate and the House of Representatives
• House of Representatives:
• Referred to as the lower house (because the legislative process typically
begins here and then proceeds to the Senate).
• The number of Representatives is based on the population of each state
(thus, the larger and more populated states—such as California, Texas, and
New York—generally have more Representatives).
• House representatives are elected to two-year terms and can be reelected
continuously.
• Senate:
• Referred to as the higher chamber (because the Senate is the second chamber in the legislative process).
• Two senators are elected from each of the 50 states (regardless of a state’s
population).
• Senators are elected to six-year terms with the possibility of reelections.
• Government lawyers:
• Prosecutor: A government attorney who prepares and conducts the prosecution of the accused party
• District Attorney (DA) (or county prosecutor): A government prosecutor
representing a particular state
• United States (U.S.) Attorney: A federal prosecutor representing the United
States for certain federal districts
An example of checks and balances in practice could involve an impeachment proceeding against the executive branch. An attempt to impeach the U.S. President (executive branch), for instance, would involve the legislative branch placing a check and
balance on the executive branch by arguing, among other things, that certain actions
of the presidency allegedly violated the U.S. Constitution. The judicial branch (federal

American Law 101
courts) can serve as a check and balance if it decides to review the acts of the legislative
branch in terms of constitutionality (i.e., to determine whether an act by the legislative
branch allegedly violated the U.S. Constitution, which all three branches must abide
by). The federal courts can also review the actions of federal administrative agencies.
At the same time, the legislative branch (Congress) can review and overrule court precedent under its designated Congressional authority.
The American legal system can appear diverse and complex. With the overview
provided in this chapter, it is hoped that readers have a better understanding and greater
clarity regarding the hardware of American law. This understanding of the American
legal infrastructure will help, as the next chapters will fill in the landscape—section by
section—that will culminate into a panoramic primer of American law.
The reading and understanding of cases is important in most, if not all, jurisdictions in the world. The U.S. legal system, which is based on the common law system of
England, treats case law (law based on the interpretation of cases by the judiciary) as
especially important. This is based on the previously mentioned concept of stare decisis. Under stare decisis, lower courts often must (as opposed to can) rule and conclude
the case in a manner consistent with higher courts in the same jurisdiction regarding
previous cases with similar facts and issues (which links back to the IRAC legal thinking process covered earlier in Chapter 1).
The American legal system’s main rationale for stare decisis is consistency and
greater foreseeability of how similar cases may be concluded by the courts. However,
with benefits come drawbacks. With stare decisis, the drawback is less judicial discretion
afforded to the courts and judges in an effort to treat each dispute on a case-by-case basis.
What is considered as the drawback of the common law system under stare decisis is
often viewed as the benefit of the civil law system, in which stare decisis does not apply.
This thus gives greater judicial discretion to the courts, at the potential cost of inconsistent judicial conclusions even within the same jurisdiction.
So which domestic legal system among the two is better: common law or civil law?
When students and even practitioners pose this question, a common first answer is that
each system has both benefits and costs (as analyzed here), and it is incumbent upon
each jurisdiction to determine which system makes the most sense, all things considered.
The other answer is that an increasing convergent trend is now occurring, whereby legal
practitioners from both common and civil legal traditions often tend to think more similarly now than in the past, particularly in commercial transactions and dealings. This
convergence may be in part a result of globalization, technological advancements, and
students studying internationally—creating a greater exposure and knowledge base of
the common law tradition (as well as civil law and other domestic legal traditions, such
as Islamic law). (See the Appendices for further specifics on the American court system.)
To understand the American legal system, legal cases reflecting case law must
be understood in great detail. This is especially critical given the importance of stare

decisis and precedent cases in American law, as discussed earlier. Because of the
importance of case law and understanding cases, the next section provides a more
detailed glimpse into the main elements of a case within the American judicial system,
including a method of how to read and brief a case—a vital skill set for both the study
and practice of American law.
How to Read and Brief a Case
With the high level of importance given to stare decisis and precedent cases underlying
American law, a fundamental knowledge of how to understand and brief a U.S. case
is critically important. This is true as a law student as well as a law practitioner who
aspires to gain a greater understanding of American law.
To begin, most court decisions are published, both at the federal and state level.
The court issuing the opinion often has the discretion in deciding whether to publish an
opinion it has rendered.
Specific case elements exist in a typical case brief, which include the following:
• Case Name and its citation to find and/or reference the case
• Author of the Opinion (the Opinion is the court’s ruling/decision): Generally,
the person who authors a legal opinion is a judge or arbitrator (the concept and
role of arbitrators is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 10).
• Opinion, which generally includes:
• Case Facts and relevant procedural history of the case, such as past appeals
and rulings
• Court Conclusion, also referred to as the case’s holding
• Reasoning: Detailing the rationale, arguments, and other factors considered
by the court
• Disposition: Court action based on the court’s ruling/conclusion (e.g., reversed, affirmed, remanded.)
The case caption can be thought of as a title for a case. Example: Brown v. Board
of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954). The case caption includes the parties, case citation (court name, law book where the opinion is published), and year of the court’s
conclusion. In terms of formality of writing for a case caption, the party names to the
dispute are italicized and/or underlined (the example has the party names italicized).
The remaining case caption (e.g., citation/reporter details, year that the decision was
rendered, and other related details) generally is not italicized or underlined.
Reporters
Cases that are published are included in publications called reporters. Each reporter has
a volume number and page numbers. Some reporters are published by the state, while

American Law 101
some are published by commercial institutions. For the case citation/reporter relating
to the previous example, the case would be found in volume 347 of the United States
Reports on page 483.
Judicial Titles
The author of the court opinion, as mentioned, is typically a judge. In this case, the
judge, in his or her capacity as legal opinion author (for the majority or minority opinion), is written at the top of the legal opinion, as follows:
Example: “Hand, J.” refers to Judge Hand.
Example: “Holmes J.” is Justice Holmes.
Some jurisdictions use terms other than “judge,” albeit referring to the same judicial decision-rendering role:
Example: “Jackson, C.” refers to Chancellor Jackson.
Example: “Jackson, V.C.” refers to Vice-Chancellor Jackson.
Example: “Jackson, C.J.” refers to Chief Judge Jackson.
Party Names
In a civil (noncriminal) case, the party initiating the lawsuit is the plaintiff, and the
party defending against the plaintiff’s lawsuit is the defendant (not coincidentally,
the term “defendant” has the term “defend” embedded in it). In criminal (noncivil)
cases, the party initiating the lawsuit is referred to as the state (or similar terminology), because the interests of the state (or other relevantly named party initiating the
lawsuit) are presumed greater than one individual (such as by a plaintiff in a civil
law case).
The plaintiffs (or state) are usually the first party listed in the caption. For the previous caption example, Brown is the plaintiff at the initial stage (prior to an appeal, if
an appeal is rendered). If a case is heard on appeal (in which a case is heard for the
second time or more), then the party initiating the appeal is called the appellant. The
party defending against the appellant’s lawsuit on appeal is called the appellee. Thus,
as an example, if the Board of Education in the previous example appealed, then the
Board of Education would be the first named party in the caption of the appealed case
(rather than second, as was the case in the original lawsuit example).
The court’s conclusion or ruling is the court’s legal opinion and the rationale
given for reaching a particular judgment, finding, or conclusion. Underneath the
broad term of legal opinion, several specific subsets of opinions exist. A concurring
opinion is an opinion rendered by a judge who would have reached the same conclusion as the majority opinion, but for a different reason (i.e., same destination, but
would have chosen a different route to get to the destination). A plurality opinion is

The American Legal System Made Easy
an opinion agreed on by less than the majority of the judges (assuming a panel of
judges), but the opinion agrees with the majority opinion’s conclusion. A dissenting
opinion is an opinion by one or more judges who disagree with the majority opinion’s
conclusion.
The parties to a lawsuit (at the initial trial court level) include the following:
• Plaintiff: Party initiating the lawsuit
• Defendant: Party defending against the lawsuit (legal action by plaintiff)
• Counterclaimant: Defendant’s counterclaim against the plaintiff
• Cross-claimant: Defendant bringing a lawsuit against a third party, typically
with a view that the introduced third party was at least partially responsible/
liable for owed damages to plaintiff
• Third-party defendant: Party defending against a cross-claim for alleged damages owed to plaintiff
• Intervenor: Interested party participating in litigation with the court’s permission
The parties to a lawsuit (at the noninitial appellate court level) include the following:
• Appellant: Party appealing a lower court’s ruling (usually the unsuccessful party in the previous lawsuit)
• Appellee: Party defending against the appellant’s actions
• Petitioner: Party challenging action, usually in an agency context
• Respondent: Party defending against petitioner’s actions, usually in an agency
context
• Intervenor: Same as intervenor at the trial court level
• Amicus curiae (“friend of the court”): Party given court permission to participate in the case
• U.S. Solicitor: Government attorney representing the United States
The parties to a lawsuit (at the highest U.S. Supreme Court level) include the
following:
• Petitioner: Party seeking the Supreme Court’s review, arguing for the rejection
of the lower court’s decision
• Respondent: Party opposing the Supreme Court’s review, arguing that the lower
court’s decision does not warrant review, because the lower court’s conclusion
and rationale are legally valid
• Intervenor: Same as intervenor at the trial/appellate court level
• Amicus curiae: Same as at the appeals court level
• U.S. Solicitor: Government attorney representing the United States

American Law 101
Court Dispositions—General
• Order: Court resolution of a motion (filed by one of the parties)
• Affirmation: Court’s decision to uphold the lower court’s ruling
• Reversal: Court’s rejection of the lower court’s ruling
• Remand: Court order to return the case to the lower court (or agency) for further factual findings, or for other resolution in conformity with the appellate
court’s decision
• Vacate: Court rejection of the lower court’s ruling, with an order to set aside and
render the lower court’s ruling as null and void
• Modification: Court’s affirmation of part of the lower court’s decision, with an
ordered modification to the opinion
Court Dispositions—Appellate Courts
• En Banc Opinion:
• Represents an opinion by all members of the court, not just a certain number
(panel) of sitting judges, to hear a particular case
• Generally represents a rare exception rather than the norm
• Usually seen in issues of extreme importance
Court Disposition—Supreme Court
• Plurality Opinion:
• An opinion that more judges sign than any concurring opinion
• Does not constitute a majority opinion
• Does not have the force of precedent, because it is not a result of a majority
opinion
• Certiorari Granted:
• Grant of discretionary review by the U.S. Supreme Court (often considered
the exception rather than the norm because the Supreme Court is unable to
grant certiorari to most cases given its limited time and resources)
• Does not reverse or directly affect lower court rulings
• Certiorari Denied:
• U.S. Supreme Court’s decision to reject discretionary review of a particular
lower court ruling
• Does not generally have precedential effect
In most legal opinions, part of the court’s decision may include analysis and language that may not directly be necessary to reach the court’s resolution of the legal
issue. This part of the case is referred to as dictum. Dictum is not the court’s holding.

The American Legal System Made Easy
In other words, dictum is related, but separate from, the court’s holding. Given that
dictum is not part of a court’s holding, stare decisis does not apply. It may be difficult
to distinguish a court’s dictum from its holding. Still, dictum may be useful for future
cases, because it is, at times, a signal or hint of how the court (or at least a judge in the
court) may view a case in light of different legal issues or facts.
Summary
The American judicial system is based on British common law, which is then buttressed by, among other sources, the U.S. Constitution, court cases, statutes, restatements, decrees, treatises, and various other rules and regulations. The American legal
system is composed of the U.S. Supreme Court, federal courts, and state courts. Within
both federal and state courts, primary and secondary legal sources are considered. The
U.S. Supreme Court is the highest land of the law. It can grant certiorari to select cases
for various reasons, including whether the issue presented is urgent or of vital national
interest. Generally, however, a lawsuit begins in state courts and then, as needed, is
heard on appeal by federal (appellate-level) or state courts. Knowledge of the structure
of the American judicial system is then furthered by understanding how to write and
brief a law case, which is a vital skill set for law students and practitioners.

393,Please answer from the text only and do not extrapolate from the source material.,What are the different ways to induce labor for an expectant mother?,"Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology
- 1 -
Induction of Labor
What is induction of labor?
Induction of labor is a medical procedure that softens the cervix (the opening
to the womb or uterus) and starts contractions (muscle movements that help
push the baby out of the uterus). This procedure is a way to plan when your
labor (childbirth) will start, instead of waiting until labor starts on its own. The
goal of an induction is to have a safe vaginal birth within 24 hours.
What happens during an induction procedure?
We use standard medications and techniques to soften and dilate (widen) the
cervix so it can reach 10 centimeters (cm) wide. A safe and effective induction
procedure includes the following:
Misoprostol (Cytotec®)
• This is a small pill that your provider will place in the
vagina every 3 hours at the start of your induction until the
cervix is 3-4 cm dilated.
• Misoprostol causes your cervix to soften and open and
starts your contractions.
Balloon
• When your cervix is between 1-3 cm dilated, your provider
will place a soft balloon at the top of the cervix. This
causes your cervix to soften and dilate.
• This balloon can also be placed in the OB Triage or in the
clinic before your scheduled induction. Then you will be
admitted to the hospital later in the day.
Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology
Induction of Labor
- 2 -
• Misoprostol is used in combination with the balloon.
Amniotomy
• When your cervix is around 3-4 cm dilated, your provider
will remove the balloon. Then they will use a device to
break the bag of water around your baby. This procedure is
called an amniotomy.
• The amniotomy causes more contractions to help labor
progress.
Oxytocin (Pitocin®)
• Starting around when your cervix is 3-4 cm dilated, your
provider will give you oxytocin through an IV (a needle
inserted into your vein).
• This medication causes contractions, and it can be easily
increased or decreased to avoid having too many
contractions. Sometimes oxytocin is also used instead of
misoprostol earlier in the induction process.
Other steps throughout your induction procedure:
• We will do cervical exams every 2-4 hours to confirm that the induction
process is going well.
• We will do continuous fetal monitoring (medical checks on the baby) to
make sure that the baby is doing well throughout the process.
• We will place an IV at the start of your induction.

Timeline (by centimeters dilated) of the induction procedures and medications:
What are the benefits of induction?
Induction for a medical reason
For some medical conditions, induction of labor is recommended to reduce the
risk of complications (medical problems) for both the pregnant person and the
baby. Timing your birth instead of waiting for spontaneous labor (whenever
labor naturally starts on its own) decreases the chance that your medical
conditions will get worse. It also decreases the risk of stillbirth (when a baby
dies during pregnancy or birth). Some of these medical conditions include:
• Pre-eclampsia and high blood pressure
• Diabetes
• Low amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios)
• When the baby is much smaller than expected
Ask your doctor, nurse, or midwife if you have a condition where early birth is
recommended.
Induction after 39 weeks of pregnancy
Induction of labor can be done safely after 39 weeks for pregnant people who
do not have a medical reason for early birth. Potential benefits include:
• Reduced risk of developing high blood pressure or pre-eclampsia later in
pregnancy
Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology
Induction of Labor
- 4 -
• Decreased risk of stillbirth (if induced before 42 weeks)
• Possibly making it less likely that you will need a Cesarean birth (a
surgery to deliver a baby through a cut made through the belly, also
called a C-section)
What are the risks of induction?
• We monitor the baby’s heartbeat continuously because sometimes labor
can be harmful to babies. If this is the case, you might need urgent or
emergency interventions (including Cesarean birth).
• An induction of labor can fail if your cervix does not dilate to 10 cm,
despite all efforts to help labor progress. If this happens, you will need a
Cesarean birth. Your doctor, midwife and nurse will regularly keep you
updated on next steps for care.
• If an induction takes too long (more than 24 hours), there is a higher risk
of bleeding, infection, and Cesarean birth.
• Patients who are induced have a longer hospital stay before birth
compared to patients who have spontaneous labor.
• It may be harder for you to rest during the early parts of your labor.
What are alternatives to induction?
• Waiting for spontaneous labor
• Cesarean birth
How can I help my induction go well?
• During the early part of the induction, try to rest as much as possible,
drink fluids, and snack lightly.
• When your contractions get stronger, rock on a birth ball or use the
shower to make yourself more comfortable. Being upright (instead of
lying down) and active helps your labor move forward.

• Change positions often, especially if you have an epidural (an injection of
medication that blocks pain during labor).
• Plan to have a support team (your partner, family member, doula, friend)
with you. Having ongoing labor support after your contractions get
stronger decreases the possibility of a Cesarean birth and improves your
labor and birth experience.
• Before you come to the hospital for your induction, learn about ways to
push effectively after the cervix is 10 cm dilated.
What can I eat and drink during an induction?
During an induction, you can eat food without animal protein or fat. Once you
get an epidural or once you’re in active labor, you can have clear liquids (like
water, apple or grape juice, gelatin, popsicles).
What does a scheduled induction look like?
On the day that your induction is scheduled, you should arrive at the Birth
Center at the time you are scheduled (unless you are contacted that day with
different instructions). Please note that we may have to delay your induction 1
day or more, depending on how busy it is in the Birth Center. We try to give you
as much advance notice as possible about delays.","The methods used to induce labor include:

(e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official
authority vested in the controller;
(f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party,
except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject
which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.
Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of
their tasks.
2. Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this
Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more
precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for
other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX.
3. The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by:
(a) Union law; or
(b) Member State law to which the controller is subject.
The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point (e)
of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of
rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the
types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for
which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and
processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific

processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of
public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.
4. Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based
on the data subject's consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate
measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to
ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are
initially collected, take into account, inter alia:
(a) any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended
further processing;
(b) the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data
subjects and the controller;

1. Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has
consented to processing of his or her personal data.
2. If the data subject's consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the
request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an
intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes
an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding.
3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall
not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject
shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent.
4. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the
performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal
data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.

Conditions applicable to child's consent in relation to information society services
1. Where point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a child,
the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is
below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised
by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.
Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13
years.

Processing of special categories of personal data
1. Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or
trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a
natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation shall be
prohibited.
2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies:
(a) the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified
purposes, except where Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not
be lifted by the data subject;
(b) processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the
controller or of the data subject in the field of employment and social security and social protection law in so far as
it is authorised by Union or Member State law or a collective agreement pursuant to Member State law providing for
appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject;

This consent must be demonstrated by the data controller and can be withdrawn by the data subject at any time, with the withdrawal being as easy as the giving of consent. For children under the age of 16, consent must be given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility. Member States may set a lower age for this purpose, but not below 13 years. Consent for processing personal data is not necessary if the processing is covered by other legal bases provided in the regulation.","Based on the provided text, a person can give consent to process their data under the following circumstances:

1. For general data processing (Article 7):
- When they can give consent freely
- When the consent request is clearly distinguishable from other matters

- When they understand they have the right to withdraw consent at any time

2. For children (Article 8):
- When they are at least 16 years old for information society services
- If under 16, consent must be given or authorized by the holder of parental responsibility
- Member States may lower the age limit but not below 13 years

3. For special categories of personal data (Article 9):
- When giving explicit consent for one or more specified purposes
- Unless Union or Member State law prohibits lifting the processing prohibition through consent

Statutory Updates
On May 13, 2022, President Biden signed the Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act, which requires
online publication of financial disclosure reports of judicial officers (including Supreme Court Justices),
bankruptcy judges, and magistrate judges. While the EIGA always mandated public access to judicial
officer financial disclosure reports, there was no central database to access the filings, and reports were
available only “in paper documents or on thumb drives.” The new law directed the Administrative Office
of the United States Courts (AO) to establish a “searchable internet database to enable public access to
any report required to be filed” under the EIGA. The AO launched the public database on November 7,
2022, and the public can now access electronic versions of federal judges’ reports. The EIGA’s allowance
for security-related redactions in judicial branch financial disclosure reports remains unchanged.
The Courthouse Ethics and Transparency Act also extended the STOCK Act’s PTR requirements to
judicial officers (including Supreme Court Justices), bankruptcy judges, and magistrate judges. Under the
provisions discussed above, federal judges are now required to report any purchase, sale, or exchange of
securities that exceeds $1,000 within 45 days of the transaction. The new public database includes access
to all of these periodic transaction reports.
Regulatory Updates
Interpretation of the EIGA’s financial disclosure requirements as applied to judicial officers and
employees has also recently changed. As mentioned above, the Committee on Financial Disclosure within
the Judicial Conference prescribes rules regarding financial disclosure by judicial officers. Those rules are
found in Volume 2, Part D, of the Guide to Judiciary Policy.
As noted above, as part of their financial disclosure reports, all covered individuals are statutorily
required to report gifts received from any source other than a relative with the exception of “food,
lodging, or entertainment received as personal hospitality.” The EIGA defines personal hospitality of any
individual as “hospitality extended for a nonbusiness purpose by an individual, not a corporation or
organization, at the personal residence of that individual or the individual’s family or on property or
facilities owned by that individual or the individual’s family.”
According to a March 2023 letter from the director of the AO, the Committee on Financial Disclosure
revised its regulations, effective March 14, 2023, specifically regarding the definition of personal
hospitality. These updated regulations appear in the notes that accompany the definition of personal
hospitality:
(1) The personal hospitality gift reporting exemption applies only to food, lodging, or entertainment
and is intended to cover such gifts of a personal, non-business nature. Therefore, the reporting
exemption does not include:
gifts other than food, lodging or entertainment, such as transportation that substitutes for commercial
transportation;
gifts extended for a business purpose;
Congressional Research Service 4
gifts extended at property or facilities owned by an entity, rather than by an individual or an
individual’s family, even if the entity is owned wholly or in part by an individual or an individual’s
family;
gifts paid for by any individual or entity other than the individual providing the hospitality, or for
which the individual providing the hospitality receives reimbursement or a tax deduction related to
furnishing the hospitality; or
gifts extended at a commercial property, e.g., a resort or restaurant, or at a property that is regularly
rented out to others for a business purpose.
The notes also clarify that judicial officers and employees are never permitted “to solicit or accept
anything of value from a person seeking official action from or doing business with the court or other
entity served by the judicial officer or employee, or from any other person whose interests may be
substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the judge’s official duties.”
There is some uncertainty as to whether these regulations apply to the Supreme Court. Although the
regulations explicitly include Justices in the definition of judicial officer, some have questioned whether
the Judicial Conference has authority over the Supreme Court. In his 2011 Year-End Report, the Chief
Justice explained that because the “Judicial Conference is an instrument for the management of the lower
federal courts, its committees have no mandate to prescribe rules or standards for any other body.”
Nonetheless, at least one Associate Justice has indicated his intention to follow the 2023 guidance going
forward, and, as discussed further below, the Justices have stated that they comply with current Judicial
Conference regulations on financial disclosure.
Supreme Court Code of Conduct
On November 13, 2023, the United States Supreme Court announced it was, for the first time, adopting a
Code of Conduct “to set out succinctly and gather in one place the ethics rules and principles that guide
the conduct of the Members of the Court.” Noting that most of the rules and principles within the Code
“are not new,” the Court explained that the Code “largely represents a codification of principles that we
have long regarded as governing our conduct.” The Code, discussed in more detail in another Legal
Sidebar, is a set of five ethical canons and accompanying commentary. The canons are nearly the same as
the existing canons in the Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges, which applies only to lower federal judges.
While many provisions of the Supreme Court Code generally address conflicts of interest and
appearances of impropriety, specific Code provisions discuss requirements related to financial activities
and compliance with the EIGA. For example, Canon 4(H) declares the Justices’ commitment to comply
with financial disclosure laws, and the commentary accompanying the Code states that the Justices
comply with the EIGA, STOCK Act, and current Judicial Conference regulations on financial disclosure.
Although the Code affirms the Justices’ compliance with existing financial disclosure laws and
regulations, it seemingly does not impose any new financial disclosure requirements on the Justices.
Considerations for Congress
Financial disclosure laws are used to identify potential or actual conflicts of interest in order to promote
integrity in the federal government. Congress may consider options to modify or clarify current financial
disclosure requirements for judicial officers. For example, the Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and
Transparency Act would, according to its sponsor, “improve disclosure of travel and hospitality for
judges” by requiring the counselor to the Chief Justice (with approval of the Chief Justice) to adopt rules
regarding disclosure of gifts, travel, and income that are “at least as rigorous as the House and Senate
disclosure rules.” This proposal was introduced before the Justices released their November 2023 Code of
Conduct, and it is unclear to what extent the Code may overlap with some of the requirements that this
bill would impose.
Congressional Research Service 5
LSB10949 · VERSION 2 · UPDATED
Financial disclosure is only one facet of a wider theme of government ethics. The EIGA, as amended,
includes not only the financial disclosure requirements discussed above but also gift and outside earned
income and employment limitations that apply to all officers and employees of the government. While the
Judicial Conference’s implementing regulations for these laws exclude Supreme Court Justices from
coverage, the commentary accompanying the recent Supreme Court Code of Conduct states that the
Justices comply with current Judicial Conference regulations on gifts, foreign gifts and decorations, and
outside earned income, honoraria, and employment in addition to regulations about financial disclosure.
This is consistent with the Justices’ long-standing voluntary compliance with certain Judicial Conference
regulations. The Code, however, does not include any enforcement mechanisms, meaning there is no
process to address alleged violations of the Code.
Proposed legislation about Supreme Court financial disclosure and other ethics requirements, including
congressional attempts to enforce the Supreme Court Code of Conduct through legislation or oversight,
may raise questions regarding Congress’s authority to regulate the Supreme Court. Some scholars have
suggested that Chief Justice Roberts in his 2011 Year-End Report questioned whether Congress may
impose ethical requirements on the Supreme Court. Other scholars have argued that while constitutional
obstacles—such as separation-of-powers issues—may exist, the Constitution does provide Congress with
authority to regulate Supreme Court ethics. This authority, however, is untested, leaving a wide array of
questions unanswered regarding the validity of current law and the extent to which Congress may impose
future regulations.
Despite any doubts as to congressional authority, the Justices, through their newly released Code of
Conduct, have acknowledged that they file “the same financial disclosure reports as other federal judges.”
Without enforcement mechanisms in the Code, however, compliance with federal ethics laws may be left
to the discretion of the Justices.","The Supreme Court adopted its first Code of Conduct in November 2023.  This Code collects existing ethical rules and principles the Justices say they have already been following.  The Code has five canons, similar to the code for other federal judges.  It addresses conflicts of interest, financial activities, and compliance with financial disclosure laws like the Ethics in Government Act (EIGA) and the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act. The Justices state in the Code that they follow these laws and related regulations from the Judicial Conference.  However, the Code itself doesn't create new rules, and it doesn't have a way to enforce its rules.
","The Supreme Court's Code of Conduct, announced on November 13, 2023, is a set of ethical guidelines created to compile the rules and principles that guide the conduct of Supreme Court Justices into one comprehensive document. The Code consists of five ethical canons, which are similar to those for lower federal judges. Most of the principles in the Code are not new but are a formal codification of standards already followed by the Justices. It includes rules concerning conflicts of interest and appearances of impropriety and reiterates the Justices' commitment to comply with financial disclosure laws like the EIGA and the STOCK Act. However, these rules do not introduce any new financial disclosure obligations for the Justices. While the Code shows the Justices' adherence to these principles, it does not include any enforcement mechanisms to address potential violations.","Based on the provided text, here's what I can tell you about the Supreme Court's Code of Conduct:

1. The Code was adopted on November 13, 2023, marking the first time the Supreme Court has had a formal Code of Conduct.

2. Key features of the Code:
- It consists of five ethical canons with accompanying commentary
- Most of the rules aren't new but rather a codification of principles they already followed
- The canons are very similar to the existing Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges (which applies to lower federal judges)
- It includes provisions about financial activities and compliance with financial disclosure laws

3. Limitations:
- The Code doesn't include any enforcement mechanisms
- There is no process to address alleged violations
- It doesn't impose any new financial disclosure requirements on the Justices

4. The Code states that Justices comply with:
- Financial disclosure laws
- The STOCK Act
- Current Judicial Conference regulations on financial disclosure
- Regulations about gifts, foreign gifts and decorations
- Rules about outside earned income, honoraria, and employment

Important to note that while this Code exists, its effectiveness is largely dependent on voluntary compliance by the Justices since there are no formal enforcement mechanisms in place.",672,883,1288,947.6666666666666
413,You must respond using only information provided in the prompt. Explain your reasoning with at least three supporting points.,What are some examples of spillover related to one's level of financial literacy?,"A lack of information is sometimes the cause of poor financial decisions. When one
party has more information than the other party, economists describe this imbalance
as “asymmetric information.” In the market for financial services, where the provider often knows more about the product, there is a potential risk to the consumer
and the economy. Financial education is a tool for helping individuals manage and
mitigate risk. Individuals who are better financially prepared can avoid unexpected
expenses, steer away from frauds and scams, and avoid taking on risks that they do
not understand or cannot afford to bear. By improving financial literacy and education, the federal government can play an important role in facilitating a vibrant and
efficient marketplace, which in turn empowers individuals to make informed financial decisions.
In supporting financial literacy and education, the government can create positive
spillovers (or positive externalities) from a more financially literate population. A more
informed population tends to be more productive and thus boosts economic activity.
A stronger economy can result in more jobs and higher wages for others.
Financial education can also help avoid negative spillovers (or negative externalities) from a less financially literate population. A negative externality is an economic
26. GAO, April 2014.
14 Federal Financial Literacy Reform: Coordinating and Improving Financial Literacy Efforts
activity that imposes a cost or negative impact on an unrelated third party. These negative externalities cause inefficiencies in the market.27 For example, when a borrower
with low financial literacy defaults on an ill-advised loan, the lender will bear some
of these costs. On the other hand, friends and family members, the government and
others may also bear the cost of that decision. Family members may directly help pay
off a loan, or cosign on future loans, increasing their own debt-to-income ratios. Thus,
the original two parties to the loan do not bear the entire cost of the transaction.
The financial crisis of 2007-2008 demonstrated how individuals and families with
limited financial literacy can be among those most dramatically affected by downturns
in the economy. Since Treasury’s mission includes a mandate to maintain a strong
economy “by promoting the conditions that enable economic growth and stability at
home and abroad,”28 it is important to keep in mind the role that individual financial
capability has in the prosperity and financial health of the nation.
The federal government cannot, and should not, bear the sole responsibility for ensuring the financial capability of individuals and households. Since the creation of the
FLEC, it has been clear that federal agencies are not solely, or even predominantly,
responsible for providing financial education to Americans. State and local governments, nonprofits and the private sector rightly have interests in promoting better
financial decision-making. For example, some employers view financial health similar to physical health and include this as part of their benefits package because of its
impact on their bottom line. These non-government entities are able to respond to
needs more quickly, develop customized strategies to deliver financial education, and
remain engaged and follow up with those served over time.
Given the substantial accomplishments and opportunities for improved financial education provided by various stakeholders outside of the federal government, it is appropriate to consider the suitable federal role. Treasury’s outreach to stakeholders has
revealed the desire for the federal government to play an overarching leadership and
guidance role, rather than trying to directly reach all Americans with financial education lessons. By embracing this role, the federal government can improve the quality
and reach of financial education activities by promoting best practices, sharing evidence, creating specific resources where appropriate, and deploying policy solutions
to support the U.S. financial education infrastructure. The federal government, then,
can be a partner, a source of trusted information and tools, and a leader to the many
financial education providers striving to improve financial literacy and capability of
their nation.

Section 1: Governance of Federal Financial Literacy and Education Efforts 15
Recommendation
Treasury recommends that the primary federal role for financial literacy and education should be to empower financial education providers as opposed to trying to
directly reach every American household. This federal role could include developing
and implementing policy, encouraging research, and other activities, including conducting financial education programs, and developing educational resources as needed
to advance best practices and standards to equip Americans with the skills, knowledge, and tools to confidently make informed financial decisions and improve their
financial well-being. The federal government should also consider the impact of the
lack of financial literacy on households and the risk to the economy from negative
externalities and market failures. Financial literacy and education should be seen as a
vehicle to guard against market failures and foster competitive markets.
Leadership and Accountability for Federal
Financial Literacy and Education
The FLEC’s structure and operations have been informal, with the Treasury providing staff support and management, including organizing public meetings, scheduling informal briefings, and managing reports to Congress and the public. While it
is clear that there is an important federal role in financial education, the structure of
financial education across the federal government has not been conducive to both
attaining measurable outcomes and coordinating activities in order to maximize the
government’s return on investment. As noted by the OMB Report and the GAO
report, financial education activities exist in many different agencies, often without a
requirement that they use or build on programs or resources already paid for by taxpayers. Congress created the FLEC with a purpose to coordinate these activities, yet
the authorities of the FLEC, as well as its structure, do not provide it with the ability to hold members accountable for coordination, efficiency or outcomes. As GAO
noted, “We acknowledge that the governance structure of the Commission presents
challenges in addressing resource issues: it relies on the consensus of multiple agencies, has no independent budget, and no legal authority to compel members to act.”29
The FLEC’s lack of clear decision-making processes and defined roles and responsibilities has impeded its ability to effectively carry out its national strategy for financial literacy, and its statutory mandates of both improving financial education, and
streamlining and improving federal financial education activities. As a result, the
FLEC lacks an effective organizational structure to facilitate goal-setting and decision-making and accountability for outcomes. A more clear and focused leadership
structure is needed to guide the work of the FLEC.
In addition to structural impediments to coordination, performance and outcome
data have not been used systematically to assess the effectiveness of federal activities
29. GAO, April 2014.
16 Federal Financial Literacy Reform: Coordinating and Improving Financial Literacy Efforts
and provide a basis to streamline, augment or improve them. Outcomes should reflect
the ability of Americans to attain improved financial decision-making as opposed
to being activity driven. The GAO has noted that “financial literacy program evaluations are most reliable and effective when they measure the programs’ impact on
consumers’ behavior.”30 By adopting measures that member agencies directly impact
(performance measures), and indirectly affect (outcome measures), the FLEC will be
able to better assess the effectiveness of financial education activities and thus make
improvements in the future.
Recommendations
Treasury recommends the FLEC establish bylaws to set clear expectations for its decision-making and roles, including establishing a six-member Executive Committee
comprised of Treasury (chair), CFPB (vice chair), and ED, HUD, DOL and DoD.
The Executive Committee will be responsible for crafting, with input from other
FLEC members, a shared agenda for action and priorities, and be accountable to
report on achievement of that agenda. The agenda would be voted on and approved
by a majority of the members.","* **Positive Spillover:** A more informed population tends to be more productive, boosting economic activity, resulting in more jobs and higher wages for others.

* **Negative Spillover (Example 2):**  In the same default scenario, the government (an unrelated third party) may also bear some of the cost. 
","1. **Positive Spillover:** A more financially literate population can lead to increased economic productivity.

2. **Negative Spillover:** A lack of financial literacy can result in individuals making poor financial decisions, such as defaulting on loans. This default can impose costs on various parties, including lenders and family members who may help pay off the loan, or cosign on future loans, thereby increasing their own debt-to-income ratios. These situations reflect negative externalities where the consequences of a bad financial decision affect not just the individual but also unrelated third parties who bear some of the cost.

3. **Avoidance of Financial Crises:** The financial crisis of 2007-2008 highlighted how individuals with limited financial literacy were among those most affected. By improving financial literacy, the risk of such negative spillovers, which can destabilize the economy and impose broad financial costs on society, can be mitigated. This reflects the importance of financial literacy in preventing market failures and safeguarding the economy from widespread negative impacts.","Based solely on the prompt, here are the spillover effects related to financial literacy:

401,System Instruction: This task requires you to answer questions based solely on the information provided in the prompt. You are not allowed to use any external resources or prior knowledge.,Question: What limitations of the PDA were solved for with the PWFA?,"Several different federal laws protect workers from discrimination based on pregnancy. The
oldest of these, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA), generally protects job applicants and
employees from adverse action—for example, firing, demotion, refusal to hire, or forced leave—
because of pregnancy or related conditions. The PDA also addresses harassment based on
pregnancy and bans retaliation against workers for making complaints about pregnancy
discrimination. Pregnancy-related conditions can include fertility treatments, medical
complications, delivery, postpartum conditions, and lactation. The PDA was enacted as an
amendment to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which protects against sex discrimination (as well as certain other
forms of discrimination) in employment.
As construed by the Supreme Court, the PDA does not generally require employers to make changes in working conditions to
accommodate pregnant workers unless employers provide accommodations to other similarly situated nonpregnant workers.
So while employers cannot fire workers for being pregnant, this statute (depending on the facts) may not require them to
make workplace changes (e.g., scheduling flexibility, an extra bathroom break) simply because employees’ demands are
pregnancy-related.
The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA), passed in 2022 and effective June 27, 2023, mandates additional protections for
pregnant workers. Modeled on the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), it requires employers to modify workplace
conditions where needed to accommodate pregnancy-related conditions as long as an accommodation is reasonable and does
not present an undue hardship to the employer. The PWFA requires a reasonable accommodation, after a case-specific
assessment, even if a pregnancy-related condition does not amount to a disability, and even if the accommodation includes
reassignment of an essential job function. Relief from an essential job function is only required, however, if it is temporary.
In addition, under the PWFA, an employer may not require an employee to take leave if a reasonable accommodation would
allow her to keep working.
Some pregnant people face pregnancy-related impairments serious enough to satisfy the ADA’s definition of a “disability”
and may, along with any PDA or PWFA claims, bring ADA claims for accommodations. Separately, many workers can
invoke the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for unpaid leave for pregnancy-related medical needs. After childbirth,
provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) entitle most nursing mothers to appropriate breaks and accommodations
for expressing breast milk.
Preceding the passage of the PWFA, many advocates and legislators proposed expanding legal protections for pregnancy.
Proposals included new pregnancy accommodation requirements (modeled on disability law), antidiscrimination measures
(expanding current statutes), and leave entitlements (in line with many analogous mandates for reemployment rights or leave
entitlements to protect workers engaged in endeavors such as military service). The PWFA focused on this first approach:
accommodations. In addition, many states have strengthened rights for pregnant workers in recent years, and the PWFA does
not preempt those laws when they offer greater protection. ","The PDA does not generally require employers to make changes in working conditions to accommodate pregnant workers unless similar accommodations are provided to other similarly situated nonpregnant workers. The PWFA requires employers to make reasonable accommodations for pregnancy-related conditions even if the condition is not a disability and even if the accommodation includes (temporary) reassignment of an essential job function, as long as it doesn't impose an undue hardship on the employer.  Additionally, the PWFA states that an employer may not require an employee to take leave if a reasonable accommodation would allow her to continue working, addressing a potential issue where employers might force leave rather than accommodate.
","The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) addressed certain limitations of the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) by requiring employers to modify workplace conditions to accommodate pregnancy-related conditions, even if those conditions do not amount to a disability. The PDA did not generally require employers to make changes in working conditions to accommodate pregnant workers unless they provided similar accommodations to other similarly situated nonpregnant workers. In contrast, the PWFA mandates reasonable accommodations for pregnancy-related conditions as long as they do not present an undue hardship to the employer. The PWFA also requires accommodations after a case-specific assessment, even if the accommodation involves reassignment of an essential job function, provided that relief from an essential job function is temporary. Additionally, the PWFA prohibits employers from forcing employees to take leave if a reasonable accommodation would allow them to continue working.","Based on the passage, the PWFA addressed several key limitations of the PDA:

1. Accommodation Requirements:
- Under the PDA, employers were only required to accommodate pregnant workers if they provided similar accommodations to non-pregnant workers in similar situations
- The PWFA mandates reasonable accommodations for pregnancy-related conditions regardless of how other workers are treated, as long as the accommodation is reasonable and doesn't create undue hardship

2. Scope of Protection:
- The PWFA requires accommodations even if the pregnancy-related condition doesn't qualify as a disability
- It allows for temporary reassignment of essential job functions if needed

3. Leave Requirements:
- The PWFA specifically prohibits employers from forcing workers to take leave if a reasonable accommodation would allow them to continue working
- This provides more flexibility and options for pregnant workers to stay on the job with appropriate accommodations

These changes represent a shift from the PDA's comparative framework (requiring equal treatment) to an affirmative accommodation requirement similar to the ADA model, providing stronger protections for pregnant workers.",747,994,1189,976.6666666666666

Recurrent First Trimester Miscarriage: A Typical  
Case Presentation and Evidence-Based  
Management Review
Vikram Talaulikar
Abstract
Recurrent miscarriage (RM), also known as recurrent pregnancy loss, 
is a distressing condition which affects about 1% of couples trying 
to achieve a pregnancy. It can be challenging for both patients and 
clinicians as the cause remains unexplained in at least 50% of cou-
ples despite multiple investigations. A systematic and evidence-based 
approach  to  testing  and  management  is  important  to  avoid  tests  or 
treatments which are unnecessary or of unproven benefit. Access to 
specialist RM clinic services and psychological support forms a key 
part of the management of couples with RM.
Keywords: Recurrent miscarriage; Treatment; Progesterone
Introduction
It is estimated that up to one in four natural pregnancies end 
up in a miscarriage which is defined as loss of pregnancy prior 
to  viability  (24  weeks’  gestation)  [1].  Recurrent  miscarriage 
(RM) is traditionally defined in the United Kingdom (UK) as 
three or more consecutive miscarriages and it can affect about 
1% of couples trying for a pregnancy [2]. The definition of RM 
varies between countries with some clinical guidelines recom-
mending investigations and treatment following two or more 
miscarriages.
The  Royal  College  of  Obstetricians  and  Gynecologists 
(RCOG)  has  issued  guidance  on  management  of  RM  in  the 
UK [2]. An updated version of this guideline is currently under 
consultation and will be released shortly.
This  article  describes  an  illustrative  typical  clinical  sce-
nario related to RM and reviews the current best practice rec-
ommendations for management of RM.
Clinical Case
The patient, 37 years old, has attended her general practition-
er’s clinic following a recent pregnancy loss. She and her part-
ner have been trying for a pregnancy for past 18 months but
 
have suffered from three miscarriages between 6 and 8 weeks’
 
gestation.  Her  last  miscarriage  happened  2  months  ago,  and
 
she  has  resumed  her  periods  2  weeks  back. All  the  miscar-
riages were managed conservatively without any medical or
 
surgical interventions. She has regular menstrual cycles (25 -
 
26 days long) and does not report any dysmenorrhea or menor-
rhagia. She is upset about the pregnancy losses, wondering if
 
it was her fault and whether something can be done in the next
 
pregnancy to change the outcome.
History
Consultations referring to RM should be performed in a sensi-
tive manner. When discussing previous miscarriages, it is im-
portant to enquire about the gestation at which pregnancy loss
 
occurred. Pregnancy loss before 9 - 10 weeks usually (but not
 
always) indicates a pre-placental cause, which may be either
 
fetal (chromosomal) or endometrial (implantation disorder) in
 
origin while that after this gestation could indicate problems
 
such as thrombophilia, placental disorders, or problems with
 
uterine structure. History of pregnancy loss after 12 weeks as-
sociated with painless cervical dilatation and rupture of mem-
branes suggests cervical weakness.
Information should be obtained about how the previous
 
miscarriages were managed: was the miscarriage completed
 
naturally or whether medical or surgical management was
 
required?  Any  possibility  of  uterine  infection  following
 
miscarriage should be explored. Changes in the menstrual
 
flow  (hypomenorrhea)  following  possible  infection  of  re-
tained products of conception or uterine curettage could in-
dicate the possibility of intrauterine adhesions. History of
 
excess alcohol consumption or smoking should be obtained
 
to offer advice on reducing risk of future miscarriage. Medi-
cal  and  relevant  family  history  should  be  obtained  as  un-
controlled  maternal  medical  conditions  such  as  diabetes,
 
thyroid or rheumatological disorders can impact the risk of
 
miscarriage  in  future  pregnancies. All  miscarriages  which
 
the  patient  suffered  from  happened  before  8  weeks  gesta-

likely pre-placental fetal or endometrial cause for her preg-
nancy loss.
Examination
On examination, patient’s body mass index (BMI) was within 
a normal range (23). Pelvic or speculum examination, guided 
by clinical history, can be useful as part of initial assessment 
especially if the woman has presented with irregular bleeding 
or  abnormal  vaginal  discharge  in  which  case  cervix  should 
be visualized to rule out other gynecological pathology such 
as ectropion/polyp and triple swabs should be obtained. The 
patient did not report any changes to her menstrual cycles or 
abnormal discharge following miscarriage.

The patient and her partner should be referred to and cared for 
in a dedicated RM clinic [2]. Psychological support and com-
munication in a sensitive manner are extremely important. A 
discussion about potential risk factors for future miscarriage 
and testing should cover the following.
Age
Increasing female age increases the chances of a genetically 
abnormal  pregnancy  as  the  number  and  quality  of  oocytes 
decrease [1]. Women between 20 and 35 years old have the 
lowest risk of miscarriage while women above the age of 40 
years  have  at  least  a  50%  chance  of  miscarriage  with  every 
pregnancy [3, 4].
BMI
High BMI (> 30) increases the risk of miscarriage [5].
Other risk factors
Other risk factors include previous miscarriages, smoking and 
excess alcohol consumption.
The patient is 37 years old and has already had three mis-
carriages which increase her risk of future miscarriage to about
 
40% [6].
Causes of RM investigations
The patient should be offered investigations for the causes of
 
RM as listed in Table 1.
Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)
This  is  an  acquired  thrombophilia  which  affects  15%  of
 
women with RM [2] and is diagnosed based on high levels
 
of anticardiolipin antibodies and/or lupus anticoagulant along
 
with evidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes (RM before 10
 
weeks or loss of one genetically normal pregnancy after 10
 
weeks or one or more preterm births before 34 weeks due to
 
placental dysfunction) or unprovoked thrombosis. APS causes
 
inhibition of trophoblast function, activation of complement
 
system  and  thrombosis  at  the  uteroplacental  interface  and
 
is  treated  with  a  combination  of  aspirin  and  low  molecular
 
weight  heparin  in  pregnancy  [1].  Inherited  thrombophilias
 
such  as  factor  V  Leiden  mutation,  prothrombin  mutation,
 
protein C, protein S and antithrombin III deficiency have an
 
uncertain role in first trimester RM and currently such tests
 
should only be offered in the context of research. The patient
 
had a negative APS screen.
Genetic
Parental   balanced   structural   chromosomal   anomalies   can
 
cause RM (2-5% of couples with RM). The risk of miscar-
riage is influenced by the size and the genetic content of the
 
rearranged chromosomal segments. Karyotyping of products
 
of conception should be offered at the time of any future mis-
carriage  and  parental  karyotyping  should  follow  if  analysis
 
of products of conception indicates that a genetic abnormal-
ity  may  have  resulted  from  an  unbalanced  translocation  [2,
 
3].  Parental  karyotyping  is  not  recommended  routinely  due
 
to low incidence of translocations and relatively high cost as-
sociated with testing.

Genetic-balanced chromosomal translocations      Karyotyping of products of conception (if abnormal result detected - parental karyotyping)
Antiphospholipid syndrome                                    Blood test for anticardiolipin antibodies and/or lupus anticoagulant (blood tests should 
be performed at least 6 weeks after any pregnancy loss and a repeat confirmatory 
test should be arranged at least 12 weeks after an initial positive screen)
Endocrine (if evidence of clinical disorder 
or risk factors): thyroid, diabetes
Thyroid function test (serum free T4 and thyroid-stimulating 
hormone levels); thyroid peroxidase antibodies; HbA1c
Uterine abnormalities such as septate 
uterus or intracavitary lesions

Endocrine
If  there  is  clinical  evidence  of  poorly  controlled  diabetes  or 
thyroid  dysfunction,  appropriate  blood  tests  should  be  per-
formed [2]. The patient did not have any symptoms or signs 
suggestive of endocrine problems and had had a thyroid hor-
mone profile at the time of her last miscarriage which revealed 
normal results.
Uterine abnormalities
Uterine abnormalities such as septate uterus or any other uter-
ine cavity pathology such as intrauterine adhesions (especially 
following an episode of uterine instrumentation and infection), 
submucous fibroids or polyps should be ruled out by offering 
a pelvic ultrasound as these may be amenable to treatment by 
surgery (hysteroscopy +/- laparoscopy) [2, 7].
The patient was offered a transvaginal scan which showed 
a regular uterine cavity.
The  evidence  regarding  the  effects  of  male  partners  on 
RM is weak and no specific testing can be recommended as 
part of investigations [1].
Advice
Lifestyle advice should always be offered to couples with RM. 
The patient should be advised to maintain a normal BMI, avoid 
excess alcohol/smoking, and take pre-conception folic acid [2, 3].
Currently, there is lack of evidence that preimplantation 
genetic testing for aneuploidy screening (PGT-A) is superior 
to expectant management in RM patients [3]. If chromosomal 
translocation was identified at the time of future miscarriage, 
genetic  counselling  should  be  offered  to  the  patient.  Repro-
ductive options following genetic counselling would include 
proceeding  to  a  further  natural  pregnancy  with  or  without  a 
prenatal diagnosis test, gamete donation and adoption [2].
As in this case, despite thorough investigations, no clear 
underlying  pathology  is  identifiable  in  at  least  50%  of  cou-
ples with RM (often labelled as “unexplained RM”) [7, 8]. The 
couple  should  be  reassured  about  good  prognosis  for  a  live 
birth in future pregnancies and offered supportive care in dedi-
cated  early  pregnancy  unit.  Many  RM  units  offer  empirical 
treatment with low dose oral aspirin (75 mg daily) and vaginal 
natural progesterone (400 mg once/twice daily) from positive 
pregnancy  test  until  12  -  14  weeks  of  pregnancy  on  a  “low 
harm, possible benefit” basis for unexplained RM. The use of 
aspirin is not recommended in current clinical guidelines due 
to debate over its clinical effectiveness.
Based  on  the  evidence  so  far,  it  appears  that  the  use  of 
progesterone supplements is beneficial particularly in women 
with previous miscarriages who bleed in early pregnancy [9, 
10]. The patient conceived again 5 months following her third 
miscarriage and had a successful pregnancy and live birth. She 
was prescribed vaginal progesterone pessaries from 7 weeks 
until 14 weeks of pregnancy following one episode of vaginal 
bleeding.
Conclusions
Couples with RM should be offered psychological support and
 
be referred to a dedicated RM service for investigations. Most
 
couples will have no identifiable pathology, and in such cases,
 
there is good prognosis for future successful pregnancy.
Learning points
RM affects about 1% of couples trying for a pregnancy and
 
no clear underlying pathology is identifiable despite investiga-
tions in at least 50% of couples.
Refer couples with RM to a dedicated RM service for in-
vestigations and plan for future pregnancies.
Offer psychological support and reassure couples with no
 
identifiable pathology about good prognosis for future preg-
nancy without pharmacological intervention.

","Patients experiencing recurrent miscarriages should be referred to a specialized clinic for testing which may include:  karyotyping of the products of conception (and parental karyotyping if results indicate a translocation), blood tests for antiphospholipid syndrome (specifically anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant), thyroid function tests (if there are symptoms or risk factors present), and a transvaginal ultrasound to assess for uterine abnormalities like a septate uterus, adhesions, fibroids, or polyps.  Testing for inherited thrombophilias is not currently recommended outside of research settings.
","Patients experiencing recurrent miscarriages should undergo comprehensive investigations to identify potential causes. These include testing for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) by checking blood levels of anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant, as this condition accounts for approximately 15% of recurrent miscarriage cases and causes complications like placental dysfunction. Genetic investigations are advised, including karyotyping of products of conception to identify any balanced chromosomal translocations that could lead to miscarriage, with parental karyotyping following if genetic anomalies are detected. Endocrine evaluations are crucial for ruling out conditions like diabetes and thyroid dysfunction, which are assessed through thyroid function tests and HbA1c measurements, particularly if clinical symptoms suggest these disorders. Additionally, transvaginal ultrasounds are recommended to identify uterine abnormalities, such as a septate uterus or intrauterine lesions, which could potentially be addressed surgically. It is also emphasized that lifestyle modifications, such as normalizing BMI and reducing alcohol and smoking, are vital in reducing miscarriage risk. Despite thorough testing, many cases remain unexplained, yet they generally have a favorable prognosis with supportive care.","Based on the document provided, patients with recurrent miscarriages should undergo several key investigations. Blood tests should be done to check for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) by measuring anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant, with tests performed at least 6 weeks after pregnancy loss and repeated after 12 weeks if initially positive. Genetic testing should be done on products of conception from any future miscarriage, and if abnormalities are found, parental karyotyping may be recommended. Endocrine testing, including thyroid function tests and HbA1c, should be performed if there are clinical signs of thyroid dysfunction or diabetes. A transvaginal ultrasound scan should be done to check for uterine abnormalities such as septate uterus or intracavitary lesions. All patients should be referred to and cared for in a dedicated recurrent miscarriage clinic where they can receive appropriate psychological support and testing, though it's important to note that despite thorough investigations, no clear underlying cause is found in about 50% of cases.",625,1324,1083,1010.6666666666666

 <TEXT>
 [context document]",Discuss the purpose of Artificial Intelligence in relationship with the financial industry as outlined in this article. Keep the response under 200 words and do not use the word technology,"Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in
 Financial Services
 The financial industry’s adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is
 evolving as financial firms employ ever greater levels of technology and automation to deliver
 services. Expanding on earlier models of quantitative analysis, AI/ML has often been adopted in
 finance to solve discrete challenges, such as maximizing profit and minimizing risk. Yet the
 industry’s adoption of the newer technology also occurs against perceptions that are steeped in
 tradition and historical financial regulation, and regulators want to ensure that the technology
 does not sidestep regulations frequently described as technology neutral.
 Technological advances in computer hardware, capacity, and data storage—which permit the collection and analysis of
 data—helped fuel the development and use of AI/ML technologies in finance. Unlike older algorithms that automated
 human-coded rules, new AI models can “learn” by themselves and make inferences and recommendations not identified by
 modelers in advance. This shift in technology has also enabled the use of new types of data including alternative data (i.e.,
 data that the consumer credit bureaus do not traditionally use), unstructured data (images or social media posts, etc.), and
 unlabeled information data—which, when combined, extend the technologies’ uses to new financial services or products.
 Different parts of the financial services industry have adopted AI/ML technology to varying degrees and for various
 purposes. Some uses of AI/ML include powering chatbots in customer service functions, identifying investment opportunities
 and/or executing trades, augmenting lending models or (more sparingly) making lending decisions, and identifying and
 preventing fraud. The extent to which a sector or firm adopts various technologies reflects a variety of factors, including a
 firm’s ability to fund internal development and regulatory requirements.
 The increased use of AI/ML to deliver financial services has attracted attention and led to numerous policy issues and
 subsequent policy actions. Such policy actions culminated in (1) the establishment of a task force on AI in the 116
 th Congress
 and the more recent working group in the House Committee on Financial Services in the 118th and (2) 2019 and 2023
 executive orders. The evolving legislative and regulatory framework regarding AI/ML use in finance is likely, at least in part,
 to influence the development of AI/ML financial services applications. Various financial regulators have indicated that
 regulated entities are subject to the full range of laws and regulations regardless of the technology used. Additionally, some
 regulators have identified regulations and issued guidance of particular relevance to financial firms employing AI/ML
 technologies.
 Financial industry policymakers face competing pressures. Financial service providers and technology companies are likely
 to continue adopting and promoting AI/ML to save time and money and promote accessibility, accuracy, and regulatory
 compliance. However, challenges and risks in the form of bias, potential for systemic risk and manipulation, affordability,
 and consequences for employment remain. Determining whether the existing regulatory structure is sufficient—or whether
 one that is more closely tailored to the technological capacities of the evolving technology is necessary—has emerged as a
 key consideration. Should Congress consider the legislative framework governing AI/ML in finance, industry and consumers
 alike will expect that it weighs the benefits of innovation with existing and potential future challenges and risks.","Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI/ML) are increasingly used in finance to enhance services, moving beyond traditional quantitative analysis.  Firms utilize AI/ML to optimize profits, mitigate risks, improve customer service (chatbots), identify investment opportunities, execute trades, enhance lending models, and detect fraud.  The degree of adoption varies depending on a firm's resources and regulatory requirements.  Policymakers are grappling with the implications of AI/ML in finance, aiming to balance innovation with potential risks like bias, systemic vulnerabilities, cost, and employment impacts. They are considering whether current regulations are sufficient or if new frameworks specifically addressing the capacities of AI/ML are needed.
","The purpose of artificial intelligence in the financial industry, as outlined in the article, revolves around enhancing and streamlining financial services through increased automation and advanced analytical capabilities. Financial firms employ AI to address specific challenges such as maximizing profits and minimizing risks. AI models, which can learn and make inferences independently, allow for the incorporation of alternative and unstructured data, thereby broadening the scope of financial services and products. AI is applied in various areas, including customer service with chatbots, investment identification and trade execution, lending model augmentation, and fraud prevention. These applications aim to save time and money, enhance accessibility and accuracy, and ensure regulatory compliance. The development of AI in finance is influenced by legislative and regulatory actions, reflecting a need to balance innovation benefits with potential challenges and risks like bias and systemic risk. Consequently, policymakers are tasked with assessing whether existing regulations suffice or if a framework more aligned with AI’s capabilities is needed.","Based on the provided text, Artificial Intelligence in the financial industry serves multiple key purposes:

1. Problem-solving: AI is used to address specific challenges like maximizing profits and minimizing risks in financial operations.

2. Customer Service: AI powers chatbots to handle customer interactions and inquiries.

3. Investment Management: It helps identify investment opportunities and executes trades.

4. Lending Operations: AI augments lending models and occasionally makes lending decisions.

5. Security: It helps identify and prevent fraudulent activities.

6. Data Analysis: AI can process and analyze new types of data, including alternative data, unstructured data (like images and social media posts), and unlabeled information.

7. Efficiency: Financial service providers use AI to save time and money while promoting accessibility and accuracy.

8. Regulatory Compliance: AI assists in maintaining compliance with financial regulations.

The text indicates that different sectors of the financial industry adopt AI to varying degrees, depending on factors such as funding capabilities and regulatory requirements. The implementation of AI aims to modernize traditional financial services while maintaining regulatory compliance and improving service delivery.",769,1164,1288,1073.6666666666667
427,Create your answer using only information found in the given context.,What are some factors that stop people from eating meat?,"Recent research has identified the major motivations and constraints around vegetarian and vegan
diets [30 ]. The main motivations to move towards a vegetarian or vegan diet are animal welfare,
the environment and personal health, whilst the major barriers are sensory enjoyment of animal
Sustainability 2019, 11, 6844 3 of 17
products, convenience and financial cost [ 30 ]. Mullee et al. [31 ] found that, when asked about
possible reasons for eating a more vegetarian diet, the most popular option chosen by omnivores
and semivegetarians was their health. The environment and animal welfare were chosen by fewer
participants, and for omnivores, these reasons ranked below ‘to discover new tastes’, ‘to reduce
weight’, and ‘no reason’. This finding has been replicated elsewhere [32 ,33 ] and implies that, for those
not currently reducing their meat consumption, potential personal benefits are more important than
environmental or ethical benefits. More specifically, consumers often recognise health benefits such as
decreased saturated fat intake, increased fruit and vegetable intake and disease prevention [ 32, 34].
On the other hand, some worry about not getting enough protein or iron from a vegetarian diet [35].
Interestingly, this prioritisation of health motives appears to be reversed for vegetarians and
vegans. According to a survey published by Humane League Labs [36], whilst health and nutrition
reasons for reducing animal product consumption are the most commonly cited by omnivores and
semivegetarians, animal welfare is the most common reason given by vegetarians and vegans. This is
logical, because improving one’s health or reducing one’s environmental impact can be achieved by
consuming incrementally fewer animal products; viewing animal products as the product of animal
suffering and exploitation, however, is more conducive to eschewing them altogether.
In a systematic review of consumer perceptions of sustainable protein consumption, Hartmann
and Siegrist [37 ] found that it is common for consumers to underestimate the ecological impact of meat
consumption. This has been observed in many different studies [33 ,38 – 40 ] and may imply a lack
of knowledge about the environmental impact of meat consumption. Alternatively, this could reflect
that consumers are generally unwilling to reduce their meat consumption [40 ] and are subsequently
motivated to minimise their perceptions of the negative consequences of their choices [41].
Indeed, such motivated reasoning appears to be evident with respect to animal welfare issues.
Most people eat meat but disapprove of harming animals, a conflict that has been dubbed ‘the meat
paradox’ [42 ]. Rothgerber [ 43] identified a number of ways in which dissonance around harming
animals arises in meat-eaters, and a number of strategies which are used to reduce this dissonance.
Dissonance-reducing strategies include denial of animal mind, denial of animals’ ability to feel pain
and dissociating meat from its animal origin [ 43 ]. This motivated reasoning results in a number of odd
conclusions, such as lower mental capacity being ascribed to food animals compared to nonfood
animals and increased denial of animal mind when one anticipates immediate meat consumption [ 44].
One can understand the motivation to continue eating animal products; the literature has identified
several considerable constraints to adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet. Studies have consistently
found that the strongest of these is simply enjoyment of eating meat [34 , 45, 46]. This was by far the
number one reason for not being vegetarian in a recent UK survey [ 47 ] and was the biggest constraint
for online survey respondents who indicated that they do not want to go vegetarian or vegan [ 36].
Despite the many potential benefits, the taste of meat and animal products is enough of a barrier
to prevent dietary change for most people.
The second most important barrier is convenience, with many consumers saying vegetarian
dishes are difficult to prepare and that there is a lack of options when eating out [ 33 ,38 ,48 ]. Humane
League Labs [36 ] found that a lack of options when eating out was the most common factor that people
said made it difficult to eat meat-free meals, whilst Schenk, Rössel and Scholz [30 ] have argued that
the additional time, knowledge and effort required to buy and prepare vegetarian or vegan food is
especially a barrier to those newly transitioning diets.
Finally, for some, there is a financial barrier [49], although there is considerably less consensus on
this in the literature [30]. A UK survey found that the high cost of meat substitutes was a barrier for
58% of consumers, though this survey conducted by VoucherCodesPro [ 47 ] may have been inclined
to focus on financial considerations. Another study found that a vegetarian diet is actually cheaper
than one containing meat, but that a vegan diet is most expensive of all [ 22 ]. This may be due to the
relatively high cost of plant-based milks and other specialist products.
Sustainability 2019, 11, 6844 4 of 17
The present study investigates UK meat-eaters’ views of various aspects of vegetarianism and
veganism. Whilst the common motivators and constraints to vegetarian and vegan diets are well
documented, there is a paucity of open data assessing how meat-eaters evaluate the relevant aspects
of each of these diets. This study seeks to address this gap by providing quantitative evaluations
of the relevant aspects of vegetarian and vegan diets. Additionally, there is currently no quantitative
comparison of these factors with respect to vegetarianism versus veganism. Therefore, this study
compares ratings of common motivators and barriers between vegetarian and vegan diets. Finally,
little is known about how these evaluations of vegetarian and vegan diets vary amongst different
demographic groups. Therefore, this study examines the overall mean ratings of each of these factors
and investigates how these views vary between different demographics.
2. Methods
2.1. Participants
Meat-eaters living in the UK aged 18 and over were recruited (n = 1000). Participants were
recruited through the online research platform, Prolific, and each participant was paid £0.45 for a 5
min survey. Recruiting participants through this type of online platform has its limitations, including
the possibility of recruiting an unrepresentative sample, and asking questions in a contrived setting
which may not be ecologically valid [ 50]. Nonetheless, this sampling technique does offer low cost
and fast recruitment of specifiable samples, and the use of Prolific as a recruitment tool in academic
research is therefore increasingly common and generally considered acceptable [51 –53 ]. Although
recruitment was for meat-eaters only, there was a small number of vegetarians in the original dataset
(n = 25); these participants were removed, and their responses were replaced with more meat-eaters.
The final sample was 49.8% male and 49.8% female (0.3% did not disclose gender, 0.1% ‘other’), and
the mean age was 34.02 (SD = 11.67).
2.2. Procedure
This study received ethical approval from the University of Bath’s Department of Psychology Ethics
Committee (PREC 18-219). The full anonymised dataset is available via OSF (see Supplementary Materials).
First, participants read some brief information about the study and gave their consent to take part.
They were then given definitions of vegetarianism and veganism and asked to give their opinions about
11 different aspects of vegetarian and vegan diets using 7-point bipolar scales. The order of these scales
and the order in which participants were asked about vegetarianism and veganism were randomised
to control for order effects. Next, participants answered questions about their intended consumption
of meat and their intended consumption of animal products ‘one month from today’. On 6-point scales,
participants could indicate that they would eliminate, greatly reduce, slightly reduce, maintain about
the same, slightly increase or greatly increase their consumption of both meat, and animal products
generally. Similar scales have been used in previous research [54,55].
It is worth noting that this measure is conservative. Compared to asking about intentions to reduce
consumption in general, defining a specific action and a specific, short time period is likely to make
participants reflect critically about their own likely behaviour. Additionally, as participants answered
this question, they saw the phrase ‘Thank you for being honest!’ which was intended to mitigate the
social desirability effect (i.e., over-reporting of intentions to reduce animal product consumption).
Finally, participants gave demographic information, including their age, gender, political
orientation, education and income. They also indicated whether they ate ‘at least occasionally’
beef, lamb, pork, chicken, fish, eggs and dairy. Participants were then debriefed and compensated.","Factors that stop people from eating meat include:

* **Sensory enjoyment of animal products:** Primarily the taste of meat.
* **Convenience:** Difficulty preparing vegetarian dishes, lack of options when eating out, additional time, knowledge, and effort required for food preparation.
* **Financial cost:** The perceived or actual high cost of meat substitutes and specialized vegan products like plant-based milks.  Some studies report a vegetarian diet as less expensive, complicating this factor.
","Several factors deter people from eating meat, including:

1. **Sensory Enjoyment**: One of the strongest barriers is the enjoyment derived from eating meat. Many people find the taste of meat and animal products appealing, which serves as a significant deterrent to dietary change.

2. **Convenience**: Another substantial barrier is the convenience of preparing and consuming meat-based diets. Vegetarian dishes are often perceived as difficult to prepare, and there can be a lack of options for meat-free meals when eating out.

3. **Financial Cost**: The cost of vegetarian or vegan diets can be a barrier for some individuals. While there is some debate, surveys have shown that the high cost of meat substitutes can be prohibitive, though not all studies agree on this point.

4. **Nutritional Concerns**: Some individuals are concerned about not getting enough protein or iron from a vegetarian diet, which may deter them from reducing meat consumption.

5. **Lack of Awareness or Motivation**: Many consumers underestimate the ecological impact of meat consumption and might not be sufficiently motivated to consider the ethical or environmental reasons for reducing meat intake. This might be attributed to a lack of knowledge or unwillingness to prioritize these over personal benefits.

These factors combine to create significant challenges for individuals who might consider reducing their meat consumption for health, environmental, or ethical reasons.","Based on the provided context, there are several key factors that stop people from eating meat:

1. Sensory enjoyment of animal products - This is consistently identified as the strongest barrier, with enjoyment of eating meat being the number one reason for not being vegetarian in a UK survey.

2. Convenience issues:
- Difficulty in preparing vegetarian dishes
- Lack of options when eating out
- Additional time, knowledge, and effort required to buy and prepare vegetarian food

3. Financial costs:
- High cost of meat substitutes (barrier for 58% of consumers in a UK survey)
- Cost of specialist products, particularly for vegan diets

4. Health concerns:
- Worries about not getting enough protein or iron from a vegetarian diet

5. Lack of knowledge:
- Underestimation of the ecological impact of meat consumption
- Lack of awareness about environmental impacts

6. Psychological factors:
- ""The meat paradox"" - conflict between eating meat and disapproving of harming animals
- Use of dissonance-reducing strategies like denial of animal mind or dissociating meat from its animal origin

These factors represent the main barriers that prevent people from adopting meat-free diets, with taste/enjoyment being the most significant barrier overall.",502,1466,1255,1074.3333333333333
382,the model should only respond using information presented in the prompt/context block.  the model response should contain at least three bullet points.,Please summarize the three articles mentioned,"Legislative History
Congress enacted the UCMJ in 1950, and it entered into force in 1951. At the time of enactment, Article
43 provided that there was no statute of limitations for “desertion or absence without leave in time of war,
or with aiding the enemy, mutiny, or murder” and set a three-year statute of limitations for most other
offenses, including rape. Article 120 provided that a person guilty of rape “shall be punished by death or
such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.” Article 55, then as now, prohibits “[p]unishment by
flogging, or by branding, marking, or tattooing on the body, or any other cruel or unusual punishment.”
Amendments to Article 43
As relevant to Briggs and Collins, Congress has amended Article 43 three times. In 1986, Congress
provided that there was no statute of limitations for “any offense punishable by death” and set a five-year
statute of limitations for most other offenses. These statutes of limitations mirrored their civilian
counterparts, which are codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3281 for offenses punishable by death, and § 3282 for
other offenses. Congress again amended Article 43 in 2003, setting a twenty-five-year statute of
limitations for child abuse offenses, including rape of a child under Article 120. Most recently, Congress
amended Article 43 in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006 (2006 NDAA) in a
section titled “Extension of Statute of Limitations for Murder, Rape, and Child Abuse Offenses under the
[UCMJ].” The 2006 amendments provided that there is no statute of limitations for “murder or rape, or
[for] any other offenses punishable by death” and modified the twenty-five-year statute of limitations for
child abuse offenses other than rape. In an accompanying report, the Senate Committee on Armed
Services described the amendments as “clarify[ing] that all murders are included in the class of offenses
that has an unlimited statute of limitations . . . [and] includ[ing] rape in that class of offenses.”
Amendments to Article 120
As with Article 43, Congress has amended Article 120 several times since its enactment. Of note, in the
2006 NDAA, Congress amended Article 120 to specify that a person guilty of rape “shall be punished as a
court-martial may direct,” removing the statutory authority to punish rape by death.
Judicial Interpretations
Before Briggs and Collins, the Supreme Court had not interpreted Articles 43, 55, or 120, but several
lower courts, including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF), had done so. Three
cases are particularly relevant to Briggs and Collins. First, in the 1983 case United States v. Matthews, the
CAAF (then known as the U.S. Court of Military Appeals) addressed whether Article 55 protected
servicemembers from cruel and unusual punishment in the same manner as the Eighth Amendment to the
U.S. Constitution. Specifically, the court considered whether the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on
cruel and unusual punishment barred the imposition of the death penalty on a servicemember found guilty
of rape and murder. The court held that “a servicemember is entitled both by statute [under Article 55]
and under the Eighth Amendment to protection against ‘cruel and unusual punishments.’” It recognized,
however, that, “since in many ways the military community is unique, . . . there may be circumstances
under which the rules governing capital punishment of servicemembers will be different from those
applicable to civilians.”
Congressional Research Service 3
In dicta, the Matthews court further observed that, while “Congress obviously intended that in cases
where an accused servicemember is convicted of . . . rape, the court-martial members should have the
option to adjudge a death sentence,” this intent “[p]robably . . . cannot be constitutionally effectuated in a
case where the rape of an adult female is involved, . . . at least, where there is no purpose unique to the
military mission that would be served by allowing the death penalty for this offense.” The court based its
reasoning on the Supreme Court’s 1977 holding in Coker v. Georgia that “a sentence of death is grossly
disproportionate and excessive punishment for the crime of rape and is therefore forbidden by the Eighth
Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment.”
Second, in the 1998 case Willenbring v. Neurauter, the CAAF held there was no statute of limitations for
rape, relying on the contemporaneous language of Articles 43(a) (“A person charged . . . with any offense
punishable by death, may be tried and punished at any time without limitation”) and 120(a) (any person
“guilty of rape . . . shall be punished by death or such other punishment as a court-martial may direct”).
The CAAF considered its decision in Matthews and the Supreme Court’s decision in Coker but held that
the 1986 amendment to Article 43 “was meant to apply to the most serious offenses without listing each
one in the statute.” The CAAF concluded that rape under Article 120 was an offense that Congress
deemed punishable by death, regardless of whether such a sentence constitutionally could be imposed.
Third, and most recently, in the 2018 case United States v. Mangahas, the CAAF overruled Willenbring.
Relying on Coker, the CAAF reasoned that where “there is no set of circumstances under which the death
penalty could constitutionally be imposed for the rape of an adult woman, that offense is simply not
‘punishable by death.’” Recognizing that “Willenbring gave short shrift to this highly salient point,” the
court overruled its prior decision. The CAAF concluded that because rape was not constitutionally
punishable by death, rapes committed between 1986 and 2006 are subject to a five-year statute of
limitations under Article 43
","Here is a summary of the three UCMJ articles discussed:

*   **Article 43 (Statute of Limitations):** Originally (1951) had no statute of limitations for certain serious offenses (desertion during wartime, aiding the enemy, mutiny, murder) and a 3-year limit for others, including rape.  It was amended several times, including in 1986 (no limit for death penalty offenses, 5 years for most others), 2003 (25-year limit for child abuse, including child rape), and 2006 (no limit for murder, rape, or other death penalty offenses; modified the child abuse limit).

*   **Article 120 (Rape):** Originally prescribed the death penalty or other punishment as determined by court-martial.  The 2006 NDAA removed the death penalty as a possible punishment for rape.

*   **Article 55 (Cruel and Unusual Punishment):** Prohibits cruel and unusual punishments, including flogging, branding, marking, or tattooing.  Case law established that it offers servicemembers protections similar to the Eighth Amendment, but with possible differences due to the unique nature of the military.
","- **Article 43**: Initially established a three-year statute of limitations for offenses like rape, but provided no limitations for desertion, aiding the enemy, mutiny, or murder during wartime. It has been amended multiple times, most notably removing the statute of limitations for murder, rape, and offenses punishable by death, while setting a twenty-five-year statute of limitations for child abuse offenses.

- **Article 120**: Originally specified that rape was punishable by death or as determined by a court-martial. Amendments, particularly in 2006, removed the statutory authority to impose the death penalty for rape, aligning with judicial interpretations that deemed death as a disproportionate punishment for the crime of rape.

- **Article 55**: Prohibits cruel or unusual punishment, including flogging, branding, or tattooing. The application of this article has been interpreted to ensure servicemembers' protections align with the Eighth Amendment, although military contexts may result in differing rules for capital punishment compared to civilian courts.","Based on the provided context, here are summaries of the three Articles mentioned:

• Article 43 (Statute of Limitations):
- Originally enacted in 1950 with no statute of limitations for desertion, absence without leave in wartime, aiding the enemy, mutiny, or murder
- Set a three-year statute of limitations for most other offenses including rape
- Underwent several amendments: 1986 (no limitations for death-punishable offenses), 2003 (25-year limit for child abuse), and 2006 (no limitations for murder and rape)

• Article 120 (Rape):
- Originally provided that rape was punishable by death or other court-martial directed punishment
- Was amended in 2006 NDAA to remove the death penalty as a punishment option
- After 2006, specified that rape ""shall be punished as a court-martial may direct""

• Article 55 (Punishment Restrictions):
- Prohibits punishment by flogging, branding, marking, or tattooing on the body
- Prohibits any other cruel or unusual punishment
- Provides servicemembers protection against cruel and unusual punishments similar to the Eighth Amendment",1075,1077,1079,1077.0

406,All information in the response should be sourced from the information provided in the prompt.,What are the mental effects of experiencing an anaphylaxis episode as they relate to growth and continued living?,"After Anaphylaxis: Learning From the Experience Having experienced your own allergic reaction or witnessing someone else having an allergic reaction, especially a severe one (anaphylaxis), can be extremely upsetting and scary. Nevertheless, it can be an opportunity to learn and feel more confident. Embrace the experience and learn from it. In order for it to not let it get you down, here are things to think about: Are you sure of the trigger that caused the allergic reaction? Confirm with your doctor! Review if it is an obvious exposure to a known allergen trigger or if it is a mystery.  You would not want to be avoiding a food that is not the real trigger nor want to miss an unexpected food allergen that is a true trigger. If it is not clear what triggered the reaction, it is especially important to review with your doctor. Keep ingredient labels, consider storing any leftover food, and ask for all possible ingredients or known allergens used around the food that caused the problem. Do not assume it was a cross contact. Consider where it happened, what your child was doing at the time, and any circumstances that are different than usual. Did you respond to the symptoms with appropriate treatment? Always more to learn! This is a great learning opportunity to review with your doctor how you recognized and treated the allergic reaction.  What did you do right? What could you have done better? After-care of anaphylaxis includes addressing the emotional toll!  o You may be sad, nervous, and distrustful for a while. This is completely normal.  This feeling should pass with time. Normal routines should return in a few weeks. It is normal for people to feel guilty, worried, anxious or unsure about “what is safe”. o Accidents happen; it is a learning experience and an opportunity to do better. See the next page on “Handling the Emotional Impact of Anaphylaxis” for more details. Stay Positive Focus on all of the success in daily life, not just on food allergy or this reaction.   The reaction was a setback, but you managed and learned! Reward positive behaviors (carrying/using medications, “no thank you” to unsafe foods, asking good questions, etc.). What to do if things are not the same after having anaphylaxis Experiencing anaphylaxis can sometimes result in longer-term increased anxiety, or lead to post-traumatic stress.  It may cause a feeling of “not knowing what is safe anymore”.  This can result in avoidance of food or situations that everyone knows is safe but cause too much anxiety.  If life is not back to normal in a few weeks, it may become necessary to address negative behaviors and feelings. You may need help. That is normal and it is OK! In the companion sheet, we provide some more information about what to expect after anaphylaxis and how to address the emotional impact pro-actively. Help is available. Talk to your doctor about referral to a mental health professional. Very effective approaches are available and can make life-changing improvements.  Some examples of what you can do: Learn coaching techniques to help your child face safe but anxiety-provoking situations. Learn whether the experience is “expected and normal” after an anaphylactic reaction or should be addressed with more assistance to get back on track. Learn relaxation techniques. Learn about the benefits of counseling, cognitive behavioral treatment or medications.  These approaches are only recommended if they are essential to help get through an episode of increased stress. Handling the Emotional Impact of Anaphylaxis – Tips & Suggestions Anaphylactic reactions can be stressful.  This handout reviews general points that both parents and patients may wish to consider in the immediate and long-term management of the emotional impact.  These are general suggestions and may not be applicable to all individuals.  Please talk to your physician about individualized care from a mental health expert if needed. THE EMOTIONAL IMPACT OF A REACTION EVOLVES OVER TIME – WHAT ONE DOES AND FEELS DURING OR IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EVENT IS NOT THE SAME AS WHAT HAPPENS LATER ON. WHAT TO DO DURING ANAPHYLAXIS OR SUSPECTED ANAPHYLAXIS? Follow your Doctor’s orders regarding the administration of epinephrine, anti-histamines and further emergency care, if needed. Parent: try to project calm while doing so, if possible.  However, if you are not calm and cannot project it, do not get too upset about it.  The task now is to handle the event itself. WHAT TO DO IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EVENT IS UNDER CONTROL? OK to admit that you are or were afraid, if that is the case. Parent: try to point out that the event was handled well, if that were the case. Parent: ask the child how he or she feels - but do not persist.  It is ok if the child does not want to talk. If the child discloses distress, say that this is normal and that indeed, the event was distressing.  Validate the emotion and emphasize safety.  Physical contact (e.g. a hug) may be appropriate. WHAT TO DO LATER ON (WEEKS / MONTHS)? If indicated, there may be a need to re-evaluate “safety” (what is and is not safe to eat) given the event. This is best done with the help of an allergist. Ask your child how they feel. Try to send the message that your child can talk with you about feeling distressed, that it is normal to feel some stress even after the event has passed, and that it is a good idea to speak with you about it. Initially, there may be increased anxiety in general, or in situations that were previously thought of as safe. This is normal.  This anxiety is expected to get better over the course of a few months (not necessarily immediately). If it does not subside, or if it gets worse after a month, intervention / assistance may be needed. Adjustment after the event may include addressing the feeling that the world is less safe. The event may lead to a re-evaluation of safety; the task is to arrive at a new understanding of safety. Sometimes, this process gets derailed and the child’s feelings that she or he are not safe turn into persistent distress, an anxiety disorder, a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other reactions. Those are best managed with the help of a mental health professional. Relaxation techniques, cognitive-behavioral therapy, supportive therapy, and psychiatric medications are all options that would work for specific types of symptoms in specific instances. The preference should be for short-term, targeted interventions, unless a chronic mental health condition is diagnosed in addition to a specific response to an event. THE SILVER LINING Overcoming a period of distress may increase resilience and help the patient face other future challenges!   ","Experiencing anaphylaxis can lead to a variety of negative mental effects relating to future growth and living.  These include sadness, nervousness, distrust, guilt, worry, anxiety, and uncertainty about safety.  In some cases, the experience can cause longer-term increased anxiety or post-traumatic stress. This may manifest as avoidance of foods or situations previously considered safe. If these feelings and behaviors persist beyond a few weeks and interfere with a return to normal life, professional help from a mental health professional may be beneficial.  Such help could include coaching techniques, relaxation techniques, counseling, cognitive behavioral treatment, or medication.
","Experiencing an episode of anaphylaxis can have significant mental effects, impacting both growth and continued living. Initially, the experience can be extremely upsetting and scary, contributing to feelings of sadness, nervousness, and distrust. These emotions can take a toll mentally, leading to increased anxiety, including a possible fear of unknown triggers and a distrust in what is considered safe. For some, this anxiety can even progress to longer-term conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) if not addressed.

Despite these challenges, the aftermath of an anaphylaxis episode provides an opportunity for personal growth. Embracing the experience allows individuals to learn more about their triggers and how to effectively respond to allergic reactions. With time, most people are able to return to their normal routines and feel safer, often with greater resilience and confidence in managing future allergic events. Learning from the episode reinforces positive behaviors, such as carrying medications, communicating effectively about food safety, and making informed decisions about food consumption.

If feelings of anxiety or distress persist beyond a few weeks, seeking the help of a mental health professional is recommended. Interventions could include cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation techniques, and possibly short-term psychiatric medications. Addressing these mental effects pro-actively can result in life-changing improvements and can support an enhanced sense of safety and confidence, aiding in both personal growth and the ability to face future challenges.

Ultimately, experiencing anaphylaxis can highlight the importance of adaptability and resilience, acting as a catalyst for personal growth and an opportunity to cultivate a better understanding of one's health and well-being.","Based on the provided context, here are the mental effects of experiencing an anaphylaxis episode:

Immediate/Short-term Effects:
- Feeling sad, nervous, and distrustful

- Some may experience:
  - Longer-term increased anxiety
  - Post-traumatic stress
  - Persistent feeling of ""not knowing what is safe anymore""
  - Avoidance of foods or situations that are actually safe

Positive Growth Aspects:
- Can be viewed as a learning opportunity
- Chance to feel more confident through learning from the experience
- Overcoming the distress may increase resilience
- Can help patients face future challenges better

President’s Budget Proposal for FY2024
The FY2024 budget request included several provisions intended to improve the administration
and integrity of the UI program.51 These provisions included updating the factors used in
determining administrative funding levels, a package of integrity-focused provisions, funding to
continue to address fraud and IT modernization within the UI system, and additional funding to
continue to build and support the UI Integrity Center’s Integrity Data Hub (IDH) cross-match
systems. It also included an additional, broader package of proposed reforms to address systemic
fraud such as identity theft and other fraud in the UI program, increase funding for the COVID-19
Fraud Strike Force Teams, and provide additional funding for Inspectors General (including the
DOL Inspector General).
Proposed UI Program Administrative Funding
The FY2024 budget request included $3.5 billion for administration of the UI system, which was
an increase over the FY2023 budget request amount of $3.1 billion.52 This amount included
almost $3.0 billion “reflecting the Administration’s economic assumptions and updated workload-
processing and salary factors” to administer UI.53 Additionally, the budget request for UI
administration included $550 million in funding for RESEA. Separately, the budget request
would have provided a fourth installment of $6 million to modernize IT infrastructure and would
also have provided $150 million for program integrity purposes, including state grants to reduce
fraud through identity verification services and other IT infrastructure improvements.
The President’s budget proposal for FY2024 also proposed an alteration to the formula that
determines the federal appropriation for state UI administration, which would have been the first
substantive update in decades. Specifically, this proposal would have updated assumptions related
to UI claims processing and state UI workforce salary rates, as prior assumptions for these factors
were not capturing current administrative costs in states.
Proposed Program Integrity Legislation
The President’s FY2024 budget request also recommended a package of legislative changes to
improve UI program integrity and to provide additional funding to states to help ensure proper UI
payments. These proposals would have
• codifed the requirement for states to data match with the National Directory of
New Hires (NDNH; administered by the Department of Health and Human
Services) and the Prisoner Update Processing System (PUPS, administered by

FY2024 enacted appropriation of $3.1 billion.63 The budget request also includes $388 million in
funding for RESEA and proposes changes to the distribution formula for RESEA grants to states.
Separately, the budget would also request a fifth installment of $6 million to modernize critical
information technology infrastructure essential to the states’ administration of the UI program and
$25 million to fund the national identity verification offering that the Department launched to
help states combat identity fraud in the UI system.
Laws Enacted in the 118th Congress
This section provides summary information on the one piece of legislation with UI provisions
enacted in the 118th Congress, at the time of this report.
P.L. 118-5, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023
The Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA; P.L. 118-5; June 3, 2023) included three provisions
that (1) rescinded specified amounts of unobligated UI administrative funding made available by
the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (ARPA; P.L. 117-2; March 11, 2021), (2) effectively
reduced budgetary adjustments to discretionary spending limits for Reemployment Services and
Eligibility Assessments, and (3) rescinded all unobligated funds for Short-Time Compensation
grants created under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act; P.L.
116-136; March 27, 2020).
ARPA provided $2 billion in additional UI administrative funding to the U.S. DOL in FY2021 to
“detect and prevent fraud, promote equitable access, and ensure the timely payment of benefits.”
This funding was made available until expended and can be used for (1) federal administrative
costs, (2) system-wide infrastructure, and (3) grants to states and territories administering all UI
benefits for program integrity and fraud prevention purposes, including for identity verification
and faster claims processing.","**Proposed FY2024 UI Program Integrity Legislation Requirements for States**

The FY2024 budget request proposed several legislative changes for states to improve UI program integrity.  States would be required to perform data matches with the National Directory of New Hires (NDNH) and the Prisoner Update Processing System (PUPS). They would also be required to disclose information to the Department of Labor Office of the Inspector General (DOL-OIG), including granting access to the Interstate Connection Network (ICON) and the Integrity Data Hub (IDH).  Additionally, states could be required by the DOL Secretary to use a portion of their administrative grant to address failing performance or participate in technical assistance.  Finally, states would be required to use penalty and interest collections solely for UI administration.  The proposal also included provisions allowing states to retain a portion of recovered fraudulent overpayments, issue formal warnings to claimants not meeting work search requirements, and use contract support for Treasury Offset Program recovery efforts.
","**New State Requirements Under Proposed FY2024 Legislation**

The proposed FY2024 budget legislation introduced new requirements for states aimed at enhancing Unemployment Insurance (UI) program integrity. Key state requirements included a mandate to conduct data matching with the National Directory of New Hires and the Prisoner Update Processing System to ensure correct and timely UI benefit payments. Additionally, states were required to disclose information to the Department of Labor Office of the Inspector General (DOL-OIG) to facilitate audits and investigations. This includes providing direct access to the Interstate Connection Network and the Integrity Data Hub system for fraud prevention and detection. States would also need to allocate portions of their administrative grants to address performance issues and engage in mandatory technical assistance activities if necessary. The legislation allowed states to retain up to 5% of recovered fraudulent UI overpayments for program integrity use, mandated that penalty and interest collections be used solely for UI administration, and enabled the issuance of formal warnings for claimants not meeting work search requirements. Furthermore, states were authorized to engage contract support in recovery efforts through the Treasury Offset Program.","**State Requirements Under FY2024 Proposed Legislation**

The proposed FY2024 legislation would create several new mandatory requirements for states administering unemployment insurance. Key requirements include:

- States must conduct data matching with the National Directory of New Hires and Prisoner Update Processing System to verify benefit eligibility
- States must disclose information to the DOL Office of Inspector General and provide access to the Interstate Connection Network and Integrity Data Hub system
- States must comply with DOL requirements to use portions of administrative grants for performance improvement and technical assistance when directed
- States would be limited to retaining only 5% of recovered fraudulent UI overpayments for program integrity use
- States must use penalty and interest collections exclusively for UI administration 
- States would be required to issue formal warnings for work search requirement violations
- States would gain authority to use contract support for Treasury Offset Program recovery efforts

The proposal also includes a formula update for determining federal appropriations for state UI administration to better reflect current processing and salary costs.",1100,1312,1225,1212.3333333333333

 [context document]","Can you extract the key information from this text, and summarize what IPv6 Quality-of-Service is and how it applies to a software engineer who primarily works on web-based technologies?","IPv6 Quality-of-Service Capabilities
 A host can use the flow label and the traffic fields in the IPv6 header. A host uses these fields to identify those packets for which the host requests special handling by IPv6 routers. For example, the host can request non-default quality of service or real-time service. This important capability enables the support of applications that require some degree of consistent throughput, delay, or jitter. These types of applications are known as multi media or real-time applications.
 

 Flow Labels
 A source can use the 20-bit flow label field in the IPv6 header. A source can use this field to label those packets for which the source requests special handling by the IPv6 routers. For example, a source can request non-default quality of service or real-time service. This aspect of IPv6 is still experimental and subject to change as the requirements for flow support in the Internet become clearer. Some hosts or routers do not support the functions of the flow label field. These hosts or routers are required to set the field to zero when originating a packet. Hosts or routers forward the field without changes when forwarding a packet. Hosts or routers ignore the field when receiving a packet.
 

 What Is a Flow?
 A flow is a sequence of packets that are sent from a particular source to a particular, unicast or multicast, destination. The source also requires special handling by the intervening routers. The nature of the special handling might be conveyed to the routers by a control protocol. The control protocol can be a resource reservation protocol. The special handling also might be conveyed by information within the flow's packets, for example, in a hop-by-hop option.
 

 Active flows from a source to a destination can be multiple. Active flows can also contain traffic that is not associated with any flow. The combination of a source address and a nonzero flow label uniquely identifies a flow. Packets that do not belong to a flow carry a flow label of zero.
 

 The flow's source node assigns a flow label to a flow. New flow labels must be chosen randomly, in a “pseudo” manner. New flow labels must also be chosen uniformly from the range 1 to FFFFF hex. This random allocation makes any set of bits within the flow label field suitable for use as a hash key by routers. The routers can use the hash key to look up the state that is associated with the flow.
 

 Packets Belonging to the Same Flow
 All packets that belong to the same flow must be sent with the same source address, same destination address, and same nonzero flow label. If any of those packets include a hop-by-hop options header, then the packets must be originated with the contents of the hop-by-hop options header. The next header field of the hop-by-hop options header is excluded. If any of those packets include a routing header, then the packets must be originated with the same contents in all extension headers. The same contents include all extensions before the routing header and the routing header. The next header field in the routing header is excluded. The routers or destinations are permitted, but not required, to verify that these conditions are satisfied. If a violation is detected, the violation should be reported to the source. The violation is reported by a problem message for an ICMP parameter, Code 0. The violation points to the high-order octet of the flow label field. The high-order octet is offset one octet within the IPv6 packet.
 

 Routers are free to set up the flow-handling state for any flow. Routers do not need explicit flow establishment information from a control protocol, a hop-by-hop option, or other means. For example, when a router receives a packet from a particular source with an unknown, non-zero flow label, a router can process its IPv6 header. The router processes any necessary extension headers in the same way that the router processes extension headers with the flow label field set to zero. The routers also determine the next-hop interface. The routers might also update a hop-by-hop option, advance the pointer and addresses in a routing header, or decide how to queue the packet. The decision to queue the packet is based on the Traffic Class field of the packet. The routers can then choose to remember the results of the processing steps. Then, the routers can cache the information. The routers use the source address and the flow label as the cache key. Subsequent packets, with the same source address and flow label, can then be handled by referring to the cached information. The routers do not need to examine all those fields. The routers can assume that the fields are unchanged from the first packet that is checked in the flow.
 

 Traffic Class
 The nodes that originate a packet must identify different classes or different priorities of IPv6 packets. The nodes use the Traffic Class field in the IPv6 header to make this identification. The routers that forward the packets also use the Traffic Class field for the same purpose.
 

 The following general requirements apply to the Traffic Class field:
 

 The service interface to the IPv6 service within a node must supply the value of the Traffic Class bits for an upper-layer protocol. The Traffic Class bits must be in packets that are originated by that upper-layer protocol. The default value must be zero for all of the 8 bits.
 

 Nodes that support some of the Traffic Class bits or all of the Traffic Class bits can change the value of those bits. The nodes can change only the values in packets that the nodes originate, forward, or receive, as required for that specific use. Nodes should ignore and leave unchanged any bits of the Traffic Class field for which the nodes do not support a specific use.
 

 The Traffic Class bits in a received packet might not be the same value that is sent by the packet's source. Therefore, the upper-layer protocol must not assume that the values are the same.","IPv6 Quality-of-Service (QoS) allows hosts to request special handling of packets by routers, such as non-default or real-time service, using the Flow Label and Traffic Class fields in the IPv6 header.  This is intended for multimedia or real-time applications requiring consistent throughput, delay, or jitter.


Flow Label is a 20-bit field used to identify flows, which are sequences of packets from a source to a unicast or multicast destination requiring special handling.  While the source assigns the Flow Label, its implementation is experimental and may not be supported by all hosts or routers.


The Traffic Class field identifies different classes or priorities of packets, allowing routers to prioritize certain traffic.  While an upper-layer protocol supplies the initial value, nodes can modify it based on their specific needs.  The original value might not be preserved, so upper-layer protocols shouldn't rely on it.


For a web-based software engineer, IPv6 QoS offers potential benefits for real-time web applications, like video conferencing or online gaming, by allowing prioritization of their traffic. However, the experimental nature of Flow Label and the potential for Traffic Class modification need to be considered.
","IPv6 Quality-of-Service (QoS) involves the use of flow label and traffic fields in the IPv6 header to request special handling by routers for certain packets. This enables support for applications that require consistent throughput, delay, or jitter, such as multimedia or real-time applications. A flow is defined as a sequence of packets from a source to a destination that requires special handling, which might be indicated by a control protocol or information within the packets themselves. IPv6 allows for non-default QoS or real-time service requests through its header fields, although this feature is still experimental.

For software engineers working on web-based technologies, understanding IPv6 QoS may be important for optimizing web applications that have real-time data requirements (e.g., video streaming or online gaming). By effectively utilizing flow labels and traffic classes, engineers can potentially improve the consistency and performance of such applications across IPv6 networks. The need for correctly labeling packets and selecting traffic classes aligns with ensuring that web services maintain quality and performance standards expected by users.","Based solely on the provided passage, here's a summary of IPv6 Quality-of-Service (QoS) and its relevance to web-based software engineering:

IPv6 Quality-of-Service is a capability that allows:

1. Special handling of packets through two main mechanisms:
- Flow Labels (20-bit field)
- Traffic Class field (8 bits)

2. Key Features:
- Supports consistent throughput, delay, or jitter for multimedia/real-time applications
- Allows packets to be labeled for special handling by IPv6 routers
- Enables identification of different classes/priorities of IPv6 packets

For a web-based software engineer, this is relevant because:

1. It enables support for applications requiring:
- Consistent throughput
- Controlled delay
- Managed jitter
- Real-time service capabilities

2. Packet Management:
- Multiple active flows can exist between source and destination
- Flow labels must be randomly assigned (1 to FFFFF hex)
- Packets in the same flow must maintain consistent source address, destination address, and flow label

3. Traffic Classification:
- Allows prioritization of different types of web traffic
- Default traffic class value is zero
- Upper-layer protocols shouldn't assume traffic class values remain unchanged during transmission

The system is described as still being experimental and subject to change as Internet flow support requirements evolve.",1245,1178,1362,1261.6666666666667

 [context document]","I have an idea for a new product but I need a manufacturer to produce it for me. How do I know someone won't steal my idea, and what kinds of failsafe should I have in place in case they do try to steal my idea?","How does using an NDA with U.S. manufacturers protect your idea?
 The NDA or no disclosure agreement is a promise to keep your idea secret. They can’t file a patent application because it would publish as a patent or pre-grant publication. They can’t market your invention. These would all be considered a breach of the NDA.
 

 But, how do you get manufacturers to sign the NDA?
 

 Early on during the conversation, don’t ask the manufacturer to sign a nondisclosure agreement. That will put them on the defensive. They’ll just reject you. Most companies won’t want to sign a non-disclosure agreement immediately. NDAs are viewed as an invitation to a lawsuit since they require them to keep your information confidential. If there is even an appearance of a breach, they are afraid that you will sue them.
 

 Rather, a better approach is to see if, in general, they can make your product. Talk about generic matters first. You and the manufacturer can get a feel for each other first to see if you’re a good fit.
 

 After a while, you’ll come to a point where you need to share your idea with them. You’ve done your due diligence and you believe that this manufacturer might be a good fit for you. They’ll also want to hear your idea so that they can gain your business. It’s at this point that you should ask them to sign a non-disclosure agreement.
 

 How does using an NNN agreement with Chinese manufacturers protect your idea?
 The NNN agreement works in the same way as the NDA to protect your idea. The Chinese manufacturer is agreeing to protect your idea.
 

 But, how do you get a Chinese manufacturer to sign an NDA?
 

 First, don’t call it an NDA. Just ask them to sign an NNN agreement which stands for non-disclosure, non-compete, and non-use.  It’s their version of the NDA. Because of that, you’ll get less pushback from manufacturers in China since they’re used to signing these agreements.
 

 Click here to download a sample NNN Agreement.
 

 How does using multiple manufacturers prevent your manufacturers from stealing your idea?
 You could split up the production of your product amongst 2 or more manufacturers. This only works if your product has multiple components. In this way, no one manufacturer would know what the product is and don’t have all of the information to steal the idea from you.
 

 How does documenting your idea prevents a manufacturer from stealing your idea?
 You should document your idea to protect yourself against the manufacturer. The document we are referring to is an inventor’s notebook. It’s typically a dated running log of your ideas in a bound book.
 

 By documenting your ideas in an inventor’s notebook, you can establish which ideas are yours. If the manufacturer claims an idea is theirs, you can prove that you already had that idea by showing them your inventor’s notebook.
 

 Let’s see how this plays out in a typical scenario.
 

 You’ve done your due diligence and selected a manufacturer. You’ve entered into a nondisclosure agreement then you tell the manufacturer about your idea.
 

 As you and the manufacturer brainstorm how to make the product, the manufacturer suggests a feature for the product. They claim that feature as their own.
 

 Does that feature belong to the manufacturer? Or do you own the intellectual property?
 

 That’s the dispute between the manufacturer and you. By showing them your inventor’s notebook, you can show the manufacturer that you already thought of that feature. You can establish that the feature already belongs to you.
 

 The manufacturer might argue that you fabricated the document after the fact. However, it’s harder to do with a running logbook that’s dated.
 

 How a patent application prevents your manufacturer from stealing your idea?
 The patent application provides further proof that you invented a particular idea. In the event the manufacturer suggests a feature for your product, the patent application establishes that feature as your own if it’s already in there. They can’t argue that you fabricated the document after the fact because the USPTO establishes the filing date of that document.
 

 How a patent prevents your manufacturer from stealing your idea?
 A design patent can prevent your manufacturer from using the molds that you paid for to make and sell products to others. If they use your molds, those products would be infringing on your design patent. You can sue them for patent infringement.
 

 Moreover, if you get a utility patent, the manufacturer can’t infringe on your utility patent. Otherwise, you would sue them for patent infringement.
 

 In order to more effectively protect yourself against manufacturers, the final agreement between you and the manufacturer should include an assignment of all inventions that they come up with while they are working on your project. For example, if they came up with a feature that you like, you should be able to get a patent for that. After all, you paid them money to make products for you. You can read more about this in: Nondisclosure Agreements and other basic agreements.","Several methods are discussed to protect your idea from being stolen by a manufacturer.  These include Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with US manufacturers, and Non-Disclosure, Non-Compete, and Non-Use (NNN) agreements with Chinese manufacturers.  Using multiple manufacturers for different components of your product can prevent any single manufacturer from having the complete picture.  Documenting your ideas in a dated inventor's notebook can help prove ownership. Filing a patent application, and eventually receiving a patent, provides legal protection and grounds for legal action against infringement.  Finally, ensure your agreement with the manufacturer assigns ownership of any inventions they create while working on your project to you.
","To protect your idea when working with a manufacturer, you can take several steps. Firstly, consider using a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) or its equivalent, depending on the location of the manufacturer. In the U.S., an NDA will help ensure that the manufacturer keeps your idea secret, as breaching it can lead to legal consequences. It's advisable to request the NDA after initial discussions rather than at the very start, allowing both parties to get a feel for the partnership and increasing the likelihood of agreement.

For working with Chinese manufacturers, use an NNN agreement, which includes non-disclosure, non-compete, and non-use terms, as it's more commonly accepted there.

Additionally, you can use multiple manufacturers to handle different components of your product so that no single manufacturer has all the information needed to replicate it.

Documenting your ideas in an inventor's notebook establishes a dated record you can use to prove prior ownership of features or ideas in case of disputes.

Filing a patent application can also protect your idea by providing legal documentation of your invention. A design patent can prevent a manufacturer from using your molds, while a utility patent stops them from copying your invention, with legal recourse available should they infringe these patents.

Finally, ensure your agreement with the manufacturer includes terms that assign any inventions developed during the project to you, securing all intellectual property rights for yourself.","Based on the provided context, here are the key ways to protect your idea when working with manufacturers:

1. Use Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with U.S. manufacturers:
- Don't request an NDA immediately in initial conversations
- First discuss general capabilities and establish fit
- Ask for NDA signing only when ready to share specific details

2. Use NNN agreements with Chinese manufacturers:
- These are similar to NDAs but more accepted in China
- Stands for non-disclosure, non-compete, and non-use
- Chinese manufacturers are more familiar with these agreements

3. Consider using multiple manufacturers:
- Split production among different manufacturers if product has multiple components
- This prevents any single manufacturer from having complete knowledge of the product

4. Document your idea:
- Keep an inventor's notebook with dated entries
- This helps prove ownership of ideas and features
- Running logbook makes it harder to claim you fabricated documentation after the fact

5. File patent applications:
- Provides proof of invention with established filing dates
- Design patents can prevent manufacturers from using your molds
- Utility patents protect against infringement of your invention

6. Include proper terms in final agreement:
- Include assignment of all inventions developed during the project
- Ensures you own rights to any features developed during manufacturing

These measures provide multiple layers of protection against theft of your intellectual property while working with manufacturers.",752,1515,1536,1267.6666666666667

Improving classroom teaching
Teacher professional development
ABSTRACT
Video-based reflection on one’s own teaching represents a crucial tool in teacher education. When
student teachers reflect on negative classroom events, it elicits “self-focused attention,” which has
been associated with more intense negative emotionality. Self-focused attention can be quantitatively captured using first-person singular pronouns (“I,” “me,” “my”) in written reflections by,
for instance, student teachers. What is unclear is whether student teachers’ use of these firstperson singular pronouns in their written reflections is linked to and predicts their negative affective experiences during teaching. For the present study, a fully immersive virtual reality (VR)
classroom was implemented in which student teachers taught a lesson, provided written reflections on their teaching, and then taught a second lesson. We measured N = 59 student
teachers’ self-reported stress and heartrate responses while teaching in the VR classroom and
determined the percentage of first-person singular pronouns in their written reflections. Firstly,
our results showed that the use of first-person singular pronouns provides incremental information on manual ratings of student teachers’ foci in their written reflections. Secondly, student
teachers’ heartrates during instruction—a measure of physiological stress—were associated with
the use of first-person singular pronouns in subsequent written reflections. Thirdly, the use of
first-person singular pronouns predicted the increase in physiological stress from the first to the
second round of VR teaching. We discuss implications for automated feedback and for designing
reflective tasks.
1. Introduction
Teaching is often seen as a challenging profession (Chang, 2009; Westphal et al., 2022; . The transition to school practice, at least
when it takes place in real school classrooms, is especially demanding for student teachers1 (Goddard et al., 2006; Hultell et al., 2013;
Voss & Kunter, 2020). Fully immersive virtual reality (VR) classrooms provide a safe environment for student teachers to gain
hands-on teaching experience (Gold & Windscheid, 2020 ; Lin, 2023; Lugrin et al., 2016; Pendergast et al., 2022; Remacle et al., 2023;
Richter et al., 2022; Seufert et al., 2022). Ke and Xu (2020) suggested that active learning processes (“diving in”) and reflective

learning processes (“stepping out”) can be easily combined in VR classrooms. Thus, it may be useful to practice reflecting on classroom
situations from a more distanced perspective using VR classrooms early on in teacher education to help student teachers make a
smooth transition into the classroom. Because the setting is standardized and similar for all student teachers, VR classrooms allow us to
more accurately research the contributing factors and consequences of student teachers’ self-reflection; the highly controllable setting
increases the internal validity of research findings (Huang et al., 2021; Richter et al., 2022). This is of particular interest for research
looking at the interrelationships between student teachers’ affects in relation to their classroom experiences and their reflections upon
those experiences. VR classrooms allow us, for instance, to apply a finding from experimental psychology to the field of teacher education. Research in the fields of experimental psychology and clinical psychology has shown that self-focus after negative events is
accompanied by greater negative affect (e.g., Mor & Winquist, 2002). This finding has been explained by dysfunctional
emotion-regulation strategies (e.g., Nook et al., 2017). Applied to the context of teacher education, these findings may imply that
student teachers who are less skilled at transitioning between a more immersed perspective and a more distanced perspective on
challenging classroom events may experience more negative affect. The degree of a person’s self-focus can be determined based on the
frequency with which they use first-person singular pronouns (e.g., “I,” “me,” “my”); this has also been called “I-talk” (Tackman et al.,
2019). It would be highly relevant to examine this link between self-focused attention in written reflections—as reflected by more
frequent I-talk—and negative affect during instruction in the field of teacher education, because knowledge about the link between the
use of first-person singular pronouns and negative affect could be implemented in automated feedback systems to help identify student
teachers at risk of intense stress and burnout, allowing them to be offered personalized feedback and support. To date, however, these
questions have not been explored.
To examine whether student teachers’ use of first-person singular pronouns is an indicator of the stress level they experience in the
classroom, and whether it can predict changes in a student teachers’ stress, a highly standardized teaching situation is preferable,
because it ensures that all student teachers under study are reflecting on the same learning environment and on similar classroom
events at all measurement occasions. A VR classroom creates just such a setting. In the present study, class size in the VR classroom was
manipulated to induce higher levels of stress (large-class-size condition with a higher number of student avatars) and lower levels of
stress (small-class-size condition with a lower number of student avatars). Initially, we checked whether the use of first-person pronouns in written reflections provides incremental information about subsequent manual ratings of student-teachers’ foci (whether on
their own actions vs. student actions vs. the learning environment) in these reflections. In addition, we examine whether student
teachers who experience more self-reported stress and physiological stress (as measured by heartrate response) while teaching in a VR
classroom use more first-person singular pronouns in written reflections on their teaching. We also explore whether student teachers’
use of first-person singular pronouns in written reflections predicts the increase in stress in a subsequent VR lesson.
1.1. Reflection in teacher education: Technological advances
“Reflection” has been defined as “deliberate, purposeful, metacognitive thinking and/or action” (Koˇsir et al., 2015, p. 113) that is
believed to enhance instructional quality (Chernikova et al., 2020) by improving student teachers’ “noticing” and “knowledge-based
reasoning” (Stürmer et al., 2013; van Es & Sherin, 2008). Noticing is understood as a teachers’ ability to focus their attention on
relevant classroom events (van Es & Sherin, 2002). Knowledge-based reasoning is defined as teachers’ ability to apply their professional knowledge in order to interpret these classroom events (Borko, 2004; van Es & Sherin, 2002). In teacher education programs,
reflection is implemented in different ways, with student teachers reflecting on classroom videos of other teachers or on video recordings of their own teaching (Kleinknecht & Schneider, 2013). Technological advances have made it possible to design VR classrooms that student teachers experience as realistic and authentic classroom settings (Huang et al., 2021; Wiepke et al., 2019, allowing
them to practice and subsequently reflect on video recordings of their own teaching. Beyond the practical advantages for student
teacher education (e.g., the approval of students, parents, educators, and administrators is not required), an important benefit of VR
classrooms is the standardized classroom setting in which all student teachers experience similar classroom events for which they can
be prepared in advance. This enables teacher educators to more easily provide relevant professional knowledge tailored to managing
critical classroom events in the VR classroom; when reflecting on video recordings of their own teaching in the VR setting, student
teachers may thus be more able to apply relevant professional knowledge.
Video-based reflection generally involves written or oral reflections after viewing classroom videos; it is recommended that these
reflections follow a three-step process (e.g., Prilop et al., 2021). Firstly, student teachers are instructed to describe the relevant
classroom events; secondly, they are asked to evaluate and interpret these events; and, thirdly, they are required to identify alternative
classroom behaviors (e.g., Prilop et al., 2021). When describing relevant classroom events, student teachers may focus either on their
own actions, students’ actions, or on the learning environment as a whole (Kleinknecht & Schneider, 2013; Lohse-Bossenz et al., 2019).
Previous research has been resoundingly positive on the benefits of video-based reflection for student teachers’ professional vision (e.
g., Stürmer et al., 2013; Weber et al., 2020). Very few studies shed light on the affective experiences associated with video-based
reflection (Kleinknecht, 2021). Although Kleinknecht and Schneider (2013) suggested that reflecting on other teachers’ videos can
induce more negative affect than reflecting on one’s own teaching videos, several studies have shown that reflecting on one’s own
videos elicits intense emotional involvement (Borko et al., 2008; Seidel et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011). What is unclear, however, is to
what extent student teachers’ attentional focus (i.e., focusing on own thoughts, actions, or emotions) in the video-based reflection of
their own videos relates to their experiences of negative affect or stress.

1.2. “I-talk” as a linguistic marker of self-focused attention and negative affect
In the fields of experimental psychology and clinical psychology, there is increasing empirical evidence indicating that there is a
relationship between self-focused attention and greater negative affect (e.g., Mor & Winquist, 2002; Nook et al., 2017). For instance,
studies using correlational designs showed that self-report measures of self-focus—such as the Public and Private Self-Consciousness
Scale (Fenigstein et al., 1975), but also sentence completion tasks (Exner, 1973; Wegner & Giuliano, 1980)—are associated with
self-report measures of state or trait negative affect in non-clinical and clinical samples (for an overview, see the meta-analysis by Mor
& Winquist, 2002). Other studies showed that self-referential language (so-called “I-talk”)—as a linguistic marker of an individual’s
self-focus—is associated with more intense negative emotionality in non-clinical samples (Kern et al., 2014; Mehl et al., 2006; Yarkoni,
2010; Yee et al., 2011; see also meta-analysis by Edwards & Holtzman, 2017) and is a marker of depression (Dunnack & Park, 2009;
Rude et al., 2004; Zimmermann et al., 2016). An extensive multi-lab multi-language study with data from more than 4700 participants
recently confirmed that the use of first-person singular pronouns is linked to more intense negative emotionality and depression
(Tackman et al., 2019). The association between I-talk and depression has been explained to some extent by negative emotionality
(Tackman et al., 2019). This indicates that “I-talk” might reflect a broader dispositional tendency towards feelings of distress, but “[t]
his possibility is a topic of ongoing research” (Berry-Blunt et al., 2021, p. 5).
Although frequent I-talk is seen as maladaptive, it may be a way of processing negative affect (e.g., after receiving deprecatory
information about oneself), as a recent literature review concluded (Berry-Blunt et al., 2021). This would suggest that greater negative
affect provokes I-talk. Experimental research did not find any evidence that inducing negative affect by showing participants negative
pictures led to more I-talk (e.g., Bernard, Baddeley, Rodriguez, & Burke, 2016). In line with Bernard, Baddeley, Rodriguez, and Burke
(2016) suggestion, it may be the case that negative affect only leads to more I-talk when elicited by self-deprecating information. This
proposition is consistent with research on the negative affective experiences of teasing and ostracism, which do lead to more frequent
I-talk (Klauke et al., 2020; Kowalski, 2000).
The reverse may also be true, however. Taking a more distanced perspective—as indicated by less I-talk—may over time change an
individual’s dispositional negative emotionality (Berry-Blunt et al., 2021). Distancing, i.e., shifting one’s perspective to be more
“distant” from or less immersed in a negative event, is an adaptive emotion-regulation strategy that is characterized by a lower level of
self-focused attention and can help reduce negative affect (Kross & Ayduk, 2008). The suggestion that repeated distancing may reduce
an individual’s tendency to experience negative affect (Berry-Blunt et al., 2021) would explain why I-talk predicts future depressive
symptoms in patients (Dunnack & Park, 2009; Zimmermann et al., 2016). Even in the short term, less I-talk may lead to less negative
affect: Experimental research confirmed that distancing—i.e., using no I-talk when talking about one’s own emotions while preparing a
stressful speech—can lessen negative affect after having given the speech (Kross et al., 2014, Study 3). Thus, the causal direction of the
link between I-talk and negative emotionality is less clear, but there may be a bidirectional relationship.
1.3. Gender differences in the association between self-focus and negative affect
Based on meta-analytical findings that women exhibit a greater tendency to ruminatively self-focus than men when experiencing
depression (Johnson & Whisman, 2013), it has been suggested that the positive association between negative emotionality and the use
of first-person singular pronouns is larger for women than it is for men (e.g., Tackman et al., 2019). When examining these gender
differences, Tackman et al. (2019) underlined that the use of first-person singular pronouns seems to be driven by low-arousal negative
distress in women. In contrast, it appears that men’s use of first-person singular pronouns is driven by high-arousal negative distress
(Tackman et al., 2019). Thus, the use of first-person singular pronouns may be an indicator of different affective experiences in women
and men (Fast & Funder, 2010) and, thus, gender should be taken into account when studying the relationship between self-focus and
negative affect.
1.4. Distinguishing different forms of self-focus in written reflections
Different strands of research differ in their operationalization of self-focus. In research on reflection in teacher training, manual
ratings indicate the extent to which student teachers focus on their own actions and thoughts, on students’ actions, or on the learning
environment (e.g., Kleinknecht & Schneider, 2013). In experimental psychology, self-focus is often operationalized via the use of
first-person singular pronouns (Berry-Blunt et al., 2021; Mor & Winquist, 2002). This strand of research has argued that individuals can
take a more or less immersed or distanced perspective on their own actions and thoughts by using more or fewer first-person singular
pronouns (Kross & Ayduk, 2008; Kross et al., 2014). When reflecting on their own teaching, some student teachers may distance
themselves from the experience and therefore rarely use first-person singular pronouns, while others may immerse themselves in the
experience and use first-person singular pronouns more frequently. As such, both indicators of self-focus (qualitative ratings vs.
first-person singular pronouns) should provide incremental information about student teachers’ self-focus in their written reflections.
For student teachers taking a more immersive perspective on their own teaching, objective first-person singular pronouns (i.e.,
“me,” “myself”) may reflect a more dysfunctional form of self-focus than subjective first-person singular pronouns (i.e., “I”) (Zimmermann et al., 2016). While subjective pronouns reflect an “active or self-as-actor form of self-focus,” objective pronouns reflect a
“passive or self-as-target form of self-focus” (James, 1890; Tackman et al., 2019, p. 819) that may indicate an even more detrimental
style of processing self-relevant information (Zimmermann et al., 2016; see also more and less dysfunctional questions in Ehring,
2020). This poses the question of whether the relationship between the use of first-person pronouns and negative affect is driven
mainly by objective first-person pronouns (Zimmermann et al., 2016). As such, “it is important to evaluate whether and how the
A. Westphal et al.
Computers & Education 212 (2024) 104987
4
association between depression and I-talk varies as a function of first-person singular pronoun type” (Tackman et al., 2019, p. 819).
Previous evidence on whether subjective and objective first-person pronouns differentially relate to negative affect is mixed (there is
support in the study by Zimmermann et al., 2016; but no or inconsistent differences in the studies by Dunnack & Park, 2009; Tackman
et al., 2019). But the distinction between subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns appears to be essential in our study, in
which the relationship between the use of first-person pronouns and negative affect is examined for the first time in the context of
teacher training.
1.5. Present study
Negative emotionality may be critical for student teachers when they reflect on their own teaching, yet research has rarely
concentrated on the role of negative emotionality for reflective processes (Kleinknecht, 2021). Meanwhile, research in the field of
experimental psychology indicates that negative affect may provoke self-focused attention as indicated by the use of first-person
singular pronouns (Berry-Blunt et al., 2021). Moreover, self-focused attention may also increase the tendency towards experiencing
negative affect (Berry-Blunt et al., 2021). What we do not know is whether this applies to the context of teacher education where
student teachers reflect on their own teaching. Studying this link between self-focus and negative affect in the context of student
teachers’ written reflections can provide valuable cues for diagnostic tools, automated feedback systems, and the improvement of
student teachers’ professional self-regulation. We used a VR classroom setting, and thus a highly standardized teaching situation, to
ensure that student teachers were reflecting on similar classroom events as we examined the following research questions:
(1) Do student teachers who exhibit a greater focus on their own actions (instead of students’ actions or the classroom environment)
use more subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns in written reflections on their teaching?
Here, the assumption could be that those student teachers who use subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns more
frequently also tend to focus on themselves rather than on the students in class or on the classroom environment. However, there is no
previous research combining manual ratings of student teachers’ foci (whether on their own actions vs. student actions vs. the learning
environment) with student teachers’ subjective and objective use of first-person singular pronouns when reflecting on their own
teaching. Thus, it is unclear to what extent manual ratings of student teachers’ foci correspond to the subjective and objective use of
first-person pronouns in written reflections on their teaching. We seek to address this research gap as an exploratory question.
(2) Do student teachers who experience more self-reported stress and physiological stress (as measured by heartrate response)
while teaching in a VR classroom use more subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns in written reflections of their
teaching?
Building on empirical evidence showing that negative affect may provoke self-focused attention, we analyze whether student
teachers who experience higher levels of negative affect when teaching in the VR classroom more frequently use subjective and
objective first-person singular pronouns in their written reflections. The class size in the VR classroom, i.e., the number of student
avatars, was manipulated to evoke higher levels (large-class-size condition) and lower levels of negative affect (small-class-size
condition(Huang et al., 2022). We hypothesize that student teachers who experience more negative affect—operationalized via
self-reported and physiological stress—when teaching in the VR classroom for the first time will use more subjective and objective
first-person singular pronouns in their written reflections.
(3) Does student teachers’ use of subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns in written reflections of their teaching
predict their increase in stress in a subsequent VR lesson?
We postulate that student teachers who use more subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns in their written reflections
will experience a greater increase in self-reported and physiological stress in the second VR classroom (as compared to the stress levels
experienced when teaching in the VR classroom for the first time).
2. Material and methods
2.1. Sample and procedure
Participants were N = 65 student teachers enrolled at the University of (anonymized for review) in Germany. Four of the
participating students did not hand in their written reflection and two additional students did not participate in the second VR practice
session, limiting our analyses to n = 59 students. Student teachers were on average 24 years old (SD = 4.57) and 49% identified as
female, 51% as male, none as diverse. Most students were third-year bachelor students (58%; second-year: 27%; fourth-year: 14%).
These student teachers participated in a weekly seminar on classroom management. The seminar included two 10-min practice sessions in a VR classroom that took place two weeks apart. Both VR practice sessions followed a standardized procedure. Participants
were first given a brief standardized audio introduction on how to interact with the VR environment. Participants were then given a
brief lecture about an a priori determined topic in the VR classroom to deliver to avatar students. During the first VR teaching
experience, participants taught about the US electoral system and the 2020 US election. For the second VR teaching experience,
A. Westphal et al.
Computers & Education 212 (2024) 104987
5
participants taught about sustainability. All the instructional materials that participants needed to accomplish the teaching task were
prepared and provided by the course instructor one week before the teaching exercise. During their VR teaching session, participants
were exposed to various on-task and off-task behaviors from the avatar students, such as asking topic-related questions, chatting, or
throwing paper balls. All avatar student actions were prescribed and therefore the same for all participants in both the class with 10
student avatars and the class with 30 student avatars. Immediately after their teaching experience in the VR classroom, the student
teachers reported on their stress levels in an online questionnaire. In addition, the student teachers handed in a written reflection on
their VR teaching session in the week following the first VR practice session.2 Prior to writing their reflections, the student teachers
received guidance on the three-step reflection process. In this process, they were instructed to describe three relevant classroom
situations (Step 1), evaluate and interpret these situations based on their professional knowledge (Step 2), and outline alternatives for
classroom situations that they evaluated negatively (Step 3). Before writing their reflections, student teachers were given time to
repeatedly watch the video of the VR classroom situation in which they had taught.
2.2. Design of the VR classroom
The VR classroom was designed to resemble an upper secondary school classroom in Germany (e.g., (Wiepke et al., 2021)). It was
set up with five rows and three columns of school desks and chairs with avatar students (see Appendix). Avatar students’ names were
displayed on name tags placed on their desks and had a wide range of physical characteristics, such as skin tone, hairstyle, and
clothing.
Student teachers were randomly assigned to teach a class of either 10 or 30 student avatars when teaching the VR classroom for the
first time and again when teaching it for the second time. The avatar students engaged in a range of behaviors that included both ontask and off-task actions. These actions ranged from constructive activities, such as writing in a notebook, to less productive actions,
such as throwing a paper ball. The avatar students maintained a natural seated posture and a neutral demeanour, occasionally
redirecting their attention by shifting their gaze or adjusting their body orientation in response to the participants’ movements. The
selection of off-task behaviors was based on a compilation of common disruptive behaviors documented in the academic literature
(Borko, 2016; Wolff et al., 2016). All parameters governing the avatar students’ behaviors, including initiation time, duration, spatial
location, and behavior type, were carefully scripted to maintain uniformity across experimental conditions. This ensured that the
behaviors enacted by the avatar students remained consistent between the scenarios with 10 avatar students and those with 30 avatar
students in the classroom.
We were using the HTC VIVE headset which has a resolution of 1080 x 1200 pixels per eye with a 108◦ field of view and a refresh
rate of 90 Hz. The headset was connected to a laptop (Alienware) with a 2.2-GHz Intel Core i7-8750H processor, with 16 GB of RAM,
and a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 with 6 GB of VRAM graphic card, where the VR classroom software was operated. Essentially,
participants could move around in reality while experiencing multisensory feedback in the VR classroom. Previous studies have
confirmed that the technical setup in our VR classroom created an immersive soundscape which student teachers experienced as
realistic and authentic (Wiepke et al., 2019, 2021).
Student teachers were equally distributed across the four conditions (small class size VR1, small class size VR2: 21%; small class size
VR1, large class size VR2: 23%; large class size VR1, small class size VR2: 25%; large class size VR1, large class size VR2: 28%).3 Thus,
some teachers taught under the same conditions twice, while other teachers taught one VR session in the small class size condition and
the other VR session in the large class size condition. Student teachers teaching in the VR classroom were instructed to teach their
lesson as they would in a real classroom i.e., walking around the room and using similar observational and nonverbal behavior when
interacting with the avatar students as they would with non-virtual students.
2.3. Measures
2.3.1. Self-reported stress in the VR classroom
We measured the stress that student teachers experienced during the VR scenario using two items (“How tense did you feel in the
VR classroom?” and “How did you feel emotionally during the VR classroom?”; e.g., Delaney & Brodie, 2000). Items were answered on
a 9-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (calm, relaxed, composed) to 9 (tense). The internal consistency was good (αT1 = 0.83; αT2 =
0.85).
2.3.2. Physiological indicator of stress in the VR classroom
We operationalized student teachers’ physiological stress reactions based on their heartrate (beats per minute, BPM). Student
teachers’ BPM was measured using an armband optical HR sensor (Polar OH1) at 0.3s intervals when teaching in the VR classroom.
Prior to starting the VR scenarios, each student teachers’ baseline heartrate was measured at 0.3s intervals while student teachers were
asked to sit quietly and stay still. These baseline measures were used to control for individual differences in cardiovascular activity. We
then aggregated both heartrate measurements during the baseline phase and heartrate measurements during the VR teaching. The
differences between student teachers’ heartrate during teaching and student teachers’ baseline heartrate was used as a physiological

classroom and the written reflection, we didn’t include these written reflections in our analyses. 3 Percentages do not total 100 because of rounding.

indicator of student teachers’ stress response.
2.3.3. Self-referential language
We used the R package stringr (Wickham, 2019) to estimate the frequency of subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns. For each written reflection, we computed the percentage of subjective first-person singular pronouns (German: “ich”; English:
“I”) and the percentage of objective first-person singular pronouns (German: “mich,” “mir”; English: “me,” “myself”).4
2.3.4. Manual ratings of focus and depth in written reflections
Two independent raters manually rated the focus (as either student teachers’ own actions, student avatars’ actions, learning
environment, or no focus) and depth (description, evaluating/explaining, or reflecting on alternatives) in student teachers’ written
reflections using the software MAXQDA and following the procedure of Lohse-Bossenz et al. (2019; Kleinknecht & Groschner, ¨ 2016).
Interrater agreement was good (κ = 0.75). For our analyses, we used the coverage percentage, i.e., the number of characters in the
coded segment in relation to the total number of characters in the text.
2.4. Statistical analyses
To test the hypotheses, we conducted regression analyses using the R package MplusAutomation (Hallquist & Wiley, 2018) and
MLR as the estimation method. A manipulation check on our data was conducted by Huang et al. (2022) who probed whether student
teachers experienced more self-reported and physiological stress when teaching a VR classroom in the large-size condition than in the
small-size condition. We initially examined whether student teachers who used more subjective and objective first-person singular
pronouns focused more frequently on themselves rather than on the avatar students in class or on the classroom environment (RQ1). To
do so, we distinguished between student teachers who used subjective first-person singular pronouns with low frequency (i.e., ≤0.5 SD
below M), average frequency (≥0.5 SD below M and ≤0.5 SD above M), and high frequency (≥0.5 SD above M). A multivariate analysis
of variance was conducted with the subjective use of first-person singular pronouns (low, average, or high) as the between-person
factor and the relative frequency of the student teachers’ reflection focus (the student teacher, student avatars, or learning environment) as the dependent variable. The analysis was then repeated for the objective use of first-person singular pronouns. To examine our
second research question, we then regressed subjective and objective first-person singular pronoun use in the written reflections of the
first VR classroom on self-reported stress in these VR sessions (RQ2). We controlled for gender.5 Within this model, we allowed the use
of subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns to correlate. We specified an analogous model with physiological stress as
the predictor. In a second step, we regressed self-reported stress during the second VR classroom teaching session on the subjective and
objective use of first-person singular pronouns while controlling for self-reported stress during the first VR classroom teaching session
(RQ3). Gender and class size in the second VR classroom teaching session were used as covariates. Thus, regression coefficients of
pronoun use and gender indicate whether these variables explain changes in self-reported stress in the second, as compared to the first,
VR classroom teaching session. Analyses were conducted separately for the use of subjective and objective first-person singular
pronouns to probe whether subjective and objective first-person pronouns differentially relate to negative affect (instead of examining
incremental effects). Analogous models were computed for physiological stress. Due to technical difficulties when transferring the
heartrate data onto the storage device, heartrate while teaching in the VR classroom was only available for 40 students. There were
only 29 students for whom heartrate responses were present in both VR classrooms. We examined whether values were missing
completely at random using the MCAR-Test (Little, 1988) implemented in the R package naniar (Tierney et al., 2021). The test yielded
non-significant results (χ2 = 17.5, df = 25, p = 0.864) indicating that the values were missing completely at random. We applied the
full-information maximum-likelihood approach (FIML; Enders, 2001) to obtain appropriate estimates and standard errors.
3. Results
A manipulation check on our data Huang et al., 2022)showed that student teachers experienced more self-reported and physiological stress when teaching a VR class in the large-size condition than in the small-size condition. Descriptive results (Table 1) and a
dependent t-test showed that self-reported stress was greater in the first VR session than in the second VR session, t(54) = 4.89, p <
0.001. In contrast, physiological stress did not differ statistically significantly between the two VR sessions, t(28) = 0.68, p = 0.503.
3.1. Subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns and manual ratings of focus in written reflections
Pertaining to our first research question, we checked whether student teachers with a more frequent use of subjective and objective
first-person singular pronouns focused more often on themselves rather than on the avatar students in class or on the classroom
environment (Fig. 1a and b). A multivariate analysis of variance with the subjective use of first-person singular pronouns (low,
average, or high) as a between-person factor and relative frequency of student teachers’ focus of reflection on their own actions (as
opposed to focus on student avatars or the learning environment) as a dependent variable showed no statistically significant effect, F(6,
4 The objective first-person singular pronoun “meiner” is rarely used and was not considered here—following the suggestion by Tackman et al.
(2019)—because it overlaps with the more frequently used possessive pronoun “meiner”. 5 We did not look for interaction effects between the use of first-person singular pronouns and gender as our sample was small.

108) = 0.59, p = 0.74. Similarly, we found no statistically significant difference between students with low, average, or high frequency
of the objective use of first-person singular pronouns on the relative frequency of student teachers’ reflection being focused on their
own actions, F(6, 108) = 1.18, p = 0.32. Thus, high subjective or objective first-person singular pronoun use was not reflected in a
greater focus on student teachers’ own actions in written reflections (as indicated by manual ratings).
3.2. Do student teachers who experience more stress in the VR session use more subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns in
their written reflections?
To answer our second research question regarding the relationship between student teachers’ stress in the VR session and the use of
subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns, we conducted cross-sectional regression analyses. Our results showed that selfreported stress experienced during the first VR teaching session was not statistically significantly associated with the use of subjective
and objective first-person singular pronouns (Table 2). Gender showed a statistically significant association with subjective and
objective pronoun use, indicating that student teachers who identified as male used subjective and objective first-person singular
pronouns more frequently than student teachers who identified as female. In contrast, physiological stress experienced during the first
VR teaching session was statistically and positively associated with both the use of subjective and the use of objective first-person
singular pronouns. Thus, student teachers who experienced greater physiological stress when teaching in the VR classroom used
more subjective or objective first-person singular pronouns in their written reflections. Beyond physiological stress, associations between gender and the use of subjective or objective first-person pronouns were not statistically significant.
3.3. Do student teachers who use more subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns in their written reflections experience a
greater increase in stress in the second VR session?
Concerning our third research question, we examined whether student teachers who used more subjective and objective firstperson singular pronouns in their written reflection experienced a greater increase in stress in the second VR session. When
regressing the self-reported stress that participants experienced during the second VR teaching session, the use of subjective firstperson singular pronouns was not a statistically significant predictor when controlling for self-reported stress in the first VR teaching session, gender and class size during the second VR teaching session (Table 3, Model 3a). The use of objective first-person singular
pronouns emerged as a statistically significant predictor of self-reported stress during the second VR teaching session (Table 3, Model
3b). This was not in line with our cross-sectional findings and we therefore conducted additional analyses, which revealed that the
association between the use of objective first-person singular pronouns and self-reported stress was explained by the level of physiological stress in the first VR teaching session (Table A2 in Appendix). Concerning the covariates, gender and class size were not
statistically significant predictors of self-reported stress in both models (Models 3a-b, Table 3). Associations between self-reported
stress experienced in the first and in the second VR teaching session were statistically significant, indicating that student teachers
who experienced more self-reported stress in the first VR teaching session reported more self-reported stress in the second VR teaching
session.
Associations between physiological stress during the second VR teaching session and the use of subjective first-person singular
pronouns were statistically significant when controlling for physiological stress experienced during the first VR teaching session and
class size in the second VR session (Table 3, Model 4a). Thus, student teachers who used more subjective first-person singular pronouns
in their written reflections of the first VR teaching session experienced a stronger increase in physiological stress during the second VR
teaching session. We found no association between physiological stress during the second VR teaching session and the use of objective
first-person singular pronouns (Table 3, Model 4b). Regarding the covariates, gender was not a statistically significant predictor of
physiological stress in either model, while a greater class size for the second VR classroom was associated with greater physiological
stress (Models 4a-b, Table 3). Student teachers who experienced greater physiological stress in the first VR teaching session exhibited
more intense physiological stress in the second VR teaching session.
4. Discussion
Negative affect can play a crucial role in student teachers’ reflection, but it has barely been studied (Kleinknecht, 2021). The

present study applied psychological research on the relationship between negative affect and self-focus—which would potentially be
valuable for diagnostic tools, automated feedback systems, and the improvement of emotion regulation—to the context of student
teachers’ reflections. Initially, we looked at whether student teachers who used more subjective and objective first-person singular
pronouns focused more frequently on themselves rather than on the avatar students in the VR class or on the classroom environment as
a whole. In addition, we examined whether student teachers’ negative affect while teaching in a VR classroom—in terms of higher
self-reported stress and heartrate—affected their self-focus in written reflections operationalized via the subjective and objective use of
first-person singular pronouns. We also explored whether the use of subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns relates to
stress in a subsequent teaching session in a VR classroom.
Initially, we found that there were no differences in manual ratings of focus between student teachers with a low, average, or high
subjective or objective use of first-person singular pronouns. This is in line with findings illustrating that individuals can regard their
own actions and thoughts from a more or less immersed or distanced standpoint, which is reflected in their more or less frequent use of
subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns (Kross & Ayduk, 2008; Kross et al., 2014). While one student teacher, for
instance, described classroom disruptions during his lesson from a more immersed perspective, pointing out how it made him feel
(“Some classroom disturbances made me upset […]. The interruptions kept me from getting back to where I started and from finishing
properly.”), another student started his reflection by taking a more distanced perspective, describing his own actions from a
third-person perspective (“There is a recurring loss of the common thread due to class disruptions and the teacher trying to address
every minor disruption.”). Thus, the use of subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns provides incremental information to
manual ratings of focus in written reflections. Future research examining student teachers’ focus when reflecting on their own teaching
could therefore benefit from incorporating different measures of self-focus.

Our results also indicate that student teachers who experienced more physiological stress when teaching in the VR classroom used
more subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns in their written reflections. This finding is consistent with research
showing that negative affective experiences may provoke the use of subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns as a way to
process negative self-relevant information (Berry-Blunt et al., 2021; Klauke et al., 2020; Kowalski, 2000). However, given their
cross-sectional nature, our results could also indicate that student teachers who use less linguistic distancing—i.e., who are more
immersed into a situation, indicated by a greater use of subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns—experience higher
levels of negative affect, which is also in line with previous findings (Shahane et al., 2023). Our study is the first to confirm that this
association can be replicated in the context of student teachers’ reflections on their own teaching. Our results further amplify existing
research by revealing that this relationship generalizes to a physiological indicator of negative affect, namely to individuals’
heartrates.
In terms of gender differences, our results suggested that student teachers who identified as male used more subjective and
objective first-person singular pronouns than student teachers who identified as female. These gender differences disappeared when
controlling for physiological stress experienced during the VR teaching session. The finding that men used subjective and objective
first-person singular pronouns more frequently than women is not in line with related research that shows a greater tendency in women
to ruminatively self-focus when depressed, and thus experiencing high levels of negative affect (Johnson & Whisman, 2013). It has,
however, been suggested that men’s use of subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns is an indicator of high-arousal
negative distress, while women’s use of first-person singular pronouns is driven by low-arousal negative distress (Tackman et al.,
2019). In our study, student teachers were reflecting on a teaching situation that had the potential to elicit high-arousal negative
distress. Indeed, we found that, when controlling for physiological stress experienced during the VR session, gender differences in the
use of subjective and objective first-person singular pronouns disappeared. These results further support the notion that the use of
first-person singular pronouns may be an indicator of different affective experiences in women and men (Fast & Funder, 2010).
In addition, we found that greater use of subjective first-person singular pronouns led to higher physiological stress in the subsequent VR session. Thus, we found some indication that student teachers who took a more distanced perspective experienced reduced
future stress (as suggested by Berry-Blunt et al., 2021; Zimmermann et al., 2016). This is in line with research showing that individuals
who spontaneously use more linguistic distancing when reflecting on negative and positive events report lower levels of stress in these
and in subsequent situations, and overall greater well-being (Shahane et al., 2023). Despite the fact that the use of subjective and
objective first-person singular pronouns may be a strategy that student teachers use to process negative teaching experiences, this
strategy—referred to as rumination—is considered maladaptive (e.g., Mor & Winquist, 2002). Rumination—i.e., the strategy of
regulating negative mood by repeatedly focusing one’s attention on one’s own negative experiences, and the causes and effects
(Nolen-Hoksema, 1991)—has been associated with depression (Hong, 2007), inefficient problem-solving, and lower self-efficacy
(Lyubomirsky et al., 2003; Reindl et al., 2020). Teachers who ruminate more experience higher levels of stress in the classroom
and are more susceptible to burnout (Koˇsir et al., 2015). We assessed naturally occurring differences in the use of subjective and
objective first-person singular pronouns and may therefore have underestimated the benefits of taking a more distanced perspective.
Future studies with greater sample sizes and power should aim to explore whether a similar effect might emerge for objective
first-person pronouns, for which we found a marginally significant p-value.
In contrast, our data did not support the association between self-reported negative affect and the use of subjective and objective
first-person singular pronouns. Berry-Blunt et al. (2021) proposed that some psychometric units, i.e., “facets, nuances, and items” (p. 8)
might capture I-talk better than others; our self-report measure of stress may not have been ideal in this respect. Moreover, the
self-report was assessed after the VR session, which potentially led to lower congruence between physiological and self-reported stress
responses than when self-report is assessed continuously during the stressful situation (Campbell & Ehlert, 2012).
4.1. Pedagogical implications
While reflection can improve student teachers’ professional vision, and is therefore seen as an important tool in teacher education
(e.g., Stürmer et al., 2013; Weber et al., 2020), less is known about its potential to assist adaptive emotion regulation strategies that
teachers need in order to be able to cope with challenging classroom events (Chang, 2009). Reappraising a challenging situation is seen
as an effective strategy (Gross, 2002) by which teachers change how they think about an event and thereby decrease its emotional
impact (Chang, 2009; Gross, 2022). When engaging in reappraisal, teachers may reduce their use of first-person singular pronouns,
indicating their greater psychological distance to a challenging situation (Nook et al., 2020). Our findings indicate that an increased
self-focus in student teachers’ written reflections—as indicated by a more frequent use of subjective first-person singular pronouns—is
associated with greater physiological stress. Automated feedback systems could build on this finding by identifying student teachers
who repeatedly experience elevated stress and are thus at risk for depression and burnout. This could complement feedback on the
quality of their written reflections (Wulff et al., 2022, 2023). We found some indication that taking a more distanced perspective—as
indicated by less frequent use of subjective first-person pronouns—reduces future stress (as suggested by Berry-Blunt et al., 2021;
Shahane et al., 2023; Zimmermann et al., 2016). Practicing taking a more distanced perspective on negative events is not only seen as
an adaptive emotion-regulation strategy (Kross & Ayduk, 2008), it may over time change a student teacher’s tendency to experience
stress (for a similar suggestion outside the context of teacher education, see Berry-Blunt et al., 2021). A structured practice of reappraisal can facilitate adaptive emotion regulation (Christou-Champi et al., 2015). Thus, training student teachers to use more reappraisal and put more distance between themselves and challenging classroom situations when reflecting on their teaching could be a
viable strategy to help them cope with stress. In addition, Ehring (2020) suggests that ruminative thinking, i.e., focusing one’s
attention on one’s own negative experiences, can be transformed into more adaptive information processing by focusing attention on
A. Westphal et al.
Computers & Education 212 (2024) 104987
11
physical reactions and emotions in a specific situation and fostering self-compassion, which has been shown to be incompatible with
ruminative thinking (Watkins, 2016). Combining video-based reflection on one’s own teaching with reappraisal and
mindfulness-based strategies could be a promising way to foster student teachers’ professional vision, as well as their well-being and
stress-resistance.
4.2. Limitations and future research
The current study has some limitations. The sample size of the study was small. Our results should therefore be replicated using a
larger sample, which could more effectively detect small effects. By providing a highly standardized setting, the VR classroom increases the internal validity of our research findings, which may come at the cost of ecological validity. It has been argued that VR
creates a perceptual illusion and “the real power of VR […] [is that] even though you know it is an illusion, this does not change your
perception or your response to it” (Slater, 2018, p. 2). Some features of the VR environment, such as a realistic display of the environment, a smooth display of motion and view changes, and control of behaviors, are seen as essential to increase the likelihood of
optimal learning in VR (Dalgarno & Lee, 2010; Delamarre et al., 2021). Prior studies showed that student teachers perceived our VR
classroom as realistic and authentic Wiepke et al., 2019, 2021. Student teachers trained in our VR classroom showed similar reflection
processes compared to students reflecting on real classroom videos and showed a substantial increase in reflection-related self-efficacy
over time (Richter et al., 2022). Nevertheless, more validation studies are needed to evaluate the transferability of the positive results
of the participation in a VR learning setting to authentic classrooms. Moreover, future studies should investigate whether our findings
are generalizable to non-virtual classroom environments and to in-service teachers. Studies should also incorporate further self-report
measures of negative affect to “identify […] the smaller psychometric units (e.g., trait facets, nuances, and items) that best capture
I-talk” (Berry-Blunt et al., 2021, p. 8). To better understand the temporal dynamics between negative affect and self-focused attention,
a longitudinal study with multiple measurements is necessary. Such a study design could help explain the extent to which
situation-specific and personal characteristics play a role in the interplay between the use of subjective and objective first-person
singular pronouns and negative affect. The extent to which student teachers can be trained to more professionally process negative
events could be explored by experimentally manipulating the ways in which student teachers describe and evaluate negative classroom
events—taking either a distanced or a self-immersed perspective—by prompting student teachers to use distanced vs. self-referential
language or by instructing them to reframe negative events vs. self-immerse in their emotions (see also Nook et al., 2017). Intervention
studies could be a promising approach to help identify how reflection could be implemented in a way that is beneficial for student
teachers’ professional vision and their emotion regulation, without overwhelming them.
5. Conclusions
Thanks to a standardized VR classroom environment, our study is the first to provide evidence that student teachers’ self-focus in
their written reflections is linked to the stress they experience while teaching. Our multimodal assessment of stress—based on student
teachers’ self-reports and heartrate responses—allowed for a differentiated approach to studying emotions in the VR learning environment. Not only can we show that the association between negative affect and self-focus—measured via I-talk—holds in student
teachers’ written reflections on their own teaching, but our study also adds to previous findings by showing that this link can be
generalized to individuals’ heartrates, representing a physiological indicator of negative affect. These results point to the potential that
reflecting on one’s own teaching may have for practicing adaptive emotion regulation strategies in teacher education programs.

View publication stats","Virtual reality classrooms offer student teachers a safe space to practice teaching, allowing researchers to study reflection in a standardized environment. While research suggests video-based reflection is beneficial, this study investigated the relationship between student teachers' stress levels and their use of first-person singular pronouns (""I-talk"") in written reflections after teaching in a VR classroom.  Researchers found that higher physiological stress, measured by heart rate, while teaching was associated with more I-talk in subsequent reflections, and a higher frequency of I-talk predicted increased physiological stress in a later VR teaching session.  While I-talk may be a way of processing negative experiences, it could indicate a maladaptive rumination strategy.  The frequency of I-talk did not correlate with manual ratings of the student teachers' focus in their written reflections. Further, male student teachers used I-talk more frequently than female student teachers, though this difference was not significant when controlling for physiological stress.
","Virtual teaching offers several positive and negative aspects for instructors. On the positive side, virtual reality (VR) classrooms provide a safe and standardized environment for instructors to teach, allowing for the practice of hands-on experience without the need for approval from students, parents, or administrators. VR classrooms also increase internal validity in research by providing a controlled setting that is consistent for all teachers, making it easier to measure the impact of reflective practices and other factors on teachers' stress and professional growth. However, virtual teaching also presents negative challenges, such as increased stress and negative emotional experiences for instructors. Student teachers in VR settings have been found to experience greater stress, both self-reported and physiological, when dealing with large virtual class sizes or reflecting on their teaching, suggesting that negative affect and self-focused attention influenced by VR teaching could potentially contribute to burnout. To mitigate these negative aspects, the implementation of adaptive emotion regulation strategies and automated feedback systems is suggested to help instructors better manage the stress associated with virtual teaching environments.","Based on the research paper, here are the key positive and negative aspects of virtual teaching for instructors:

Positive aspects:
- VR classrooms provide a safe environment for student teachers to gain hands-on teaching experience
- They allow for combining active learning (""diving in"") and reflective learning (""stepping out"") processes
- The standardized and controlled setting increases internal validity of research findings and allows for more accurate study of contributing factors
- Student teachers can practice reflecting on classroom situations from a more distanced perspective early in their training
- VR classrooms create realistic and authentic settings that student teachers perceive as valid learning environments

Negative aspects:
- Student teachers can experience significant stress and negative affect while teaching in VR classrooms, particularly in large class size conditions
- Those who focus too much on themselves during reflection (using more ""I-talk"") tend to experience higher physiological stress levels
- The ecological validity may be limited compared to real classroom settings
- Some features of the VR environment need to be carefully designed to ensure optimal learning (e.g., realistic display, smooth motion)
- More validation studies are still needed to evaluate if skills learned in VR transfer effectively to authentic classrooms

The research suggests that while VR teaching has important benefits for training teachers in a controlled environment, care must be taken to help teachers manage stress and develop healthy reflection practices rather than becoming overly self-focused in their reflections on teaching experiences.",1088,1269,1672,1343.0

","What Is Nanotechnology? 
Most current applications of nanotechnology are evolutionary in nature, offering incremental improvements to existing products and generally modest economic and societal benefits. For example, nanotechnology has been used in display screens to improve picture quality, color, and brightness, provide wider viewing angles, reduce power consumption and extend product lives; in automobile bumpers, cargo beds, and step-assists to reduce weight, increase resistance to dents and scratches, and eliminate rust; in clothes to increase resistance to staining, wrinkling, and bacterial growth and to provide lighter-weight body armor; and in sporting goods, such as baseball bats and golf clubs, to improve performance.4 Nanotechnology plays a central role in some current applications with substantial economic value. For example, nanotechnology is a fundamental enabling technology in nearly all microchips and is fundamental to improvements in chip speed, size, weight, and energy use. Similarly, nanotechnology has substantially increased the storage density of non-volatile flash memory and computer hard drives. In the longer term, proponents of nanotechnology believe it may deliver revolutionary advances with profound economic and societal implications. The applications they discuss involve various degrees of speculation and varying time-frames. The examples below suggest a few of the areas where revolutionary advances may emerge, and for which early R&D efforts may provide insights into how such advances might be achieved. 
Detection and treatment of diseases. A wide range of nanotechnology applications are being developed to detect and treat diseases: 
*Cancer. Current nanotechnology disease detection efforts include the development of sensors that can identify biomarkers—such as altered genes,5 receptor proteins that are indicative of newly-developing blood vessels associated with early tumor development, 6 and prostate specific antigens (PSA)7—that may provide an early indicator of cancer.8 Some of these approaches are currently in clinical trials or have been approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration.9 One approach uses carbon nanotubes and nanowires to identify the unique molecular signals of cancer biomarkers. Another approach uses nanoscale cantilevers—resembling a row of diving boards—treated with molecules that bind only with cancer biomarkers. When these molecules bind, the additional weight alters the resonant frequency of the cantilevers indicating the presence and concentration of these biomarkers. Nanotechnology also holds promise for showing the presence, location, and/or contours of cancer, cardiovascular disease, or neurological disease. Current R&D efforts employ metallic, magnetic, and polymeric nanoparticles with strong imaging characteristics attached to an antibody or other agent that binds selectively with targeted cells. The imaging results can be used to guide surgical procedures and to monitor the effectiveness of non-surgical therapies in killing the disease or slowing its growth. Nanotechnology may also offer new cancer treatment approaches. For example, researchers have developed a chemically engineered adenovirus nanoparticle to deliver a molecule that stimulates the immune system10 and a nanoparticle that safely shuts down a key enzyme in cancer cells. 11 Another approach employs nanoshells with a core of silica and an outer metallic shell that can be engineered to concentrate at cancer lesion sites. Once at the sites, a harmless energy source (such as near-infrared light) can be used to cause the nanoshells to heat, killing the cancer cells they are attached to.12 Yet another treatment uses a dual cancer-killing approach. A gold nanoshell containing a chemotherapy drug attaches itself to a cancer cell. The shell is then heated using a near-infrared light source, killing the cancer cells in the vicinity while also rupturing the shell, releasing the chemotherapy drug inside the tumor. 13 Another approach would employ a nanoparticle to carry three or more different drugs and release them “in response to three distinct triggering mechanisms.”14 
* Ebola. In February 2015, amid the Ebola outbreak in West Africa that began in 2014, the Food and Drug Administration provided emergency authorization of a nanotechnology-enabled antigen test for the detection of Ebola viruses. 
* Influenza. Medical researchers at the National Institutes for Health are using nanotechnology in the development of a molecule they intend to serve as a universal influenza vaccine that “stimulates the production of antibodies to fight against the ever-changing flu virus.” 15 
* Diabetes. Diabetes is the target of a nano-enabled skin patch that painlessly delivers insulin using an array of microneedles, each of which contains more than 100 million vesicles that release insulin in response to the detection of high glucose levels.1","* **Cancer Detection:** Nanotechnology is being explored to create sensors that can detect cancer biomarkers like altered genes, receptor proteins, and prostate-specific antigens (PSA). One method uses carbon nanotubes and nanowires to identify the unique molecular signals of these biomarkers. Another approach employs nanoscale cantilevers coated with molecules that bind only with cancer biomarkers; the added weight changes the cantilever's resonant frequency, signaling the biomarker's presence.  Nanoparticles with strong imaging characteristics can also be used to locate and visualize tumors, guiding surgical procedures and monitoring treatment effectiveness.

* **Cancer Treatment:** Several nanotechnology-based cancer treatments are under development. One involves an engineered adenovirus nanoparticle that stimulates the immune system. Another uses a nanoparticle to deliver a molecule that shuts down a key enzyme in cancer cells. Nanoshells, designed to concentrate at tumor sites, can be heated with near-infrared light to kill cancer cells.  A further approach combines chemotherapy with nanoshells; the heated nanoshells release the drug directly into the tumor.  Finally, nanoparticles capable of carrying and releasing multiple drugs in response to different triggers are also being investigated.

* **Influenza:** Researchers at the National Institutes of Health are using nanotechnology to develop a universal influenza vaccine. This molecule aims to stimulate antibody production against the constantly evolving flu virus.
","- **Cancer Treatment with Nanotechnology:**
  - Current approaches in nanotechnology focus on developing sensors that can identify cancer biomarkers, such as altered genes and prostate-specific antigens, which may indicate early tumor development. Some of these technologies are in clinical trials or FDA-approved.
  - Nanoparticles, such as nanoscale cantilevers and carbon nanotubes, are used to detect cancer biomarkers by binding to them and altering physical properties to signal presence and concentration.
  - Imaging technologies using metallic, magnetic, and polymeric nanoparticles aid in surgical guidance and monitoring non-surgical therapies’ effectiveness by binding selectively to targeted cells and showing location or contours of tumors.
  - Treatment approaches include adenovirus nanoparticles stimulating the immune system, nanoparticles shutting down cancer cell enzymes, and nanoshells heated by energy sources to kill cancer cells.
  - Dual-treatment methods involve gold nanoshells that release chemotherapy drugs upon heating, or nanoparticles designed to carry multiple drugs released by distinct triggers.

- **Influenza Treatment with Nanotechnology:**
  - The National Institutes for Health are employing nanotechnology in developing a potential universal influenza vaccine. This vaccine aims to stimulate antibody production to combat the evolving flu virus.

","Based on the provided text, I can summarize how nanotechnology is being used to treat cancer and influenza as follows:

Cancer treatment methods:
• Chemically engineered adenovirus nanoparticles are being developed to deliver molecules that stimulate the immune system, and other nanoparticles can shut down key enzymes in cancer cells.

• Nanoshells with silica cores and metallic outer shells can concentrate at cancer sites and be heated using near-infrared light to kill cancer cells.

• A dual approach uses gold nanoshells containing chemotherapy drugs that attach to cancer cells - the shells are heated to kill nearby cancer cells while simultaneously rupturing to release the drug inside the tumor.

• Some approaches in development use nanoparticles that can carry multiple drugs and release them through different triggering mechanisms.

Influenza treatment methods:
• The National Institutes for Health is developing a nanotechnology-based molecule intended to serve as a universal influenza vaccine that stimulates antibody production against evolving flu viruses.

That is all the information provided in the text about treatment methods for these two conditions. The text contains additional information about cancer detection methods, but those were not part of the question about treatment.",1547,1390,1307,1414.6666666666667

The National Labor Relations Act/Wagner Act (NLRA) of 1935 was passed by Congress
to protect workers’ rights to unionization. NLRA states and defines the rights of employees to
organize and bargain collectively with their employers through representatives of their own choosing
(i.e., elected union leaders). The NLRA identified workers’ rights to form a union, join a union, and
to strike in an effort to secure better working conditions (National Labor Relations Board, 1997).
“The act also created a new National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to arbitrate deadlocked labor-
management disputes, guarantee democratic union elections and penalize unfair labor practices by
employers” (Cooper, 2004, p. 2). Furthermore, NLRA prohibited employers from setting up a
company union and firing or otherwise discriminating against workers who organized or joined
unions (Encyclopedia Britannica, 2007).
Prior to the passage of NLRA, the federal government had been largely antagonistic to
union organizing. Labor unions across the country faced significant challenges in social action
initiatives aimed at ensuring adequate wages, benefits and the reduction of industry health hazards.
During the first half of the twentieth century, for example, laborers who attempted to organize
protective associations frequently found themselves prosecuted for and convicted of conspiracy (to
do what?) (Beik, 2005). With the onset of the Great Depression, and an unemployment rate of 24.9
percent in 1933 , the national political framework shifted its focus from the protection of the
business sector to the protection of workers and individuals through the creation of New Deal
policies (e.g., Social Security and Civilian Conservation Corps). These policies hoped to create a
social safety net that would prevent further economic disaster. Due to the power of business
interests and persons advocating a free market society, many New Deal policies had been declared
unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court, including the previous labor legislation – the
National Industry Recovery Act of 1933 which authorized the President to regulate businesses in the
interests of promoting fair competition, supporting prices and competition, creating jobs for the
unemployed, and stimulating the United States economy to recover from the Great Depression
(Babson, 1999). Thus, many businesses believed that the NLRA would follow the same path. In
April of 1937, however, the NLRA was declared constitutional by the Supreme Court, highlighting
the increased power of labor unions on national politics and policymaking (Beik, 2005).
In 1935, 15 percent of American workers were unionized. By 1945, the proportion had risen
to 35 percent (Babson, 1999). During this time there were three primary types of union/employer
structural arrangements: the agency shop, the union shop, and the closed shop. Cooper (2004)
describes the arrangements as follows:
• Agency Shop: The union’s contract does not mandate that all employees join the union, but
it does mandate that the employees pay agency fees.
• Union Shop: The union’s contract requires that all employees join the union within a
specified amount of time after becoming employed.
• Closed Shop: The union’s contract mandates that the employer only hire union members
(pg. 2).
1945 marked the peak of American unionization with over one-third of American workers belonging
to labor unions. Organized labor reached the zenith of its power in the U.S. from 1935 – 1947 (Beik,
2005). Many business leaders, however, began to lobby for a loosening of union power insisting that
businesses and individuals were, due to the NLRA, prevented from exercising their right of
association and employment procedures. At the same time, the political landscape was changing and
anti-communism was used as a key argument to stymie the power of unions. Labor unions were seen
as a corrupt socialist tactic and, thus, could be associated with the red scare. The public also began to
demand action after the World War Two coal strikes and the postwar strikes in steel, autos and other
industries were perceived to have damaged the economy.
With the increasing constituent pressure and the election in 1944 of the pro-business and
pro-states’ rights Republican congress, the second significant piece of national labor legislation was
passed, the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act. Taft-Hartley effectively overturned many of the rights guaranteed
by NLRA and outlawed the closed shop arrangement (Cooper, 2004). Moreover, “section 14(b) of
Taft-Hartley made Right-to-Work laws legal and gave states the power to pass laws to outlaw both
agency and union shops” (Cooper, 2004, p. 10). This provision afforded states the opportunity to
pass laws that forbade the establishment of businesses and/or union contracts where union
membership was a condition of employment; thus, the age of RTW began.
Right-to-Work Laws
Immediately following the passage of the Taft-Hartley Act states began to enact Right-to-
Work laws. The basic concept of RTW is that workers should not be obligated to join or give
support to a union as a condition of employment (Kersey, 2007).2 The main objectives of RTW laws
have, to this day, shared similar purposes. These objectives include: a. the promotion of individual
freedom; b. the creation of a pro-business atmosphere aimed at spurring economic growth; c. the
elimination of the power of union organization. As of January 1, 2006, 22 states had passed RTW
legislation.
It is important to note that a regional divide exists with regard to the establishment of RTW laws... most of the states with RTW laws are located in the southeast, Midwest and
Rocky Mountain States. These states have traditionally maintained lower rates of unionization --
18% in 1947, 52% lower than their non-RTW counterparts (Beik, 1998).

Right-to-Work Laws and Employment
One of the key arguments offered by proponents of RTW legislation is that the laws increase
employment. Proponents believe that, if businesses are not required to operate under union wage
contracts, they will remain profitable due to decreased labor costs and the economic landscape will
encourage cross-state relocation of businesses; thus, employment opportunities will increase for all
citizens. “Opponents, however, argue that most job growth occurs from in-state business expansion
not the relocation of businesses from a non-RTW to a RTW state” (Oklahoma League of
Economists, 1996, paragraph 2). The unemployment rates in RTW states pre and post RTW passage,
as well as the comparison of RTW to non-RTW states, provide important insights in to the impact of
RTW legislation on employment across jurisdictions.
Overall, the unemployment rates in RTW states are lower than non-RTW states. For
example, the unemployment rate between 1978 and 2000 averaged 5.8percent in RTW states versus
6.3percent in non-RTW states. Additionally, between 1970 and 2000 overall employment increased
by 2.9percent annually in RTW states versus 2.0percent in non-RTW states. This trend has
continued, although tightening, into the 2000s; between 2001 and 2006 RTW states had a median
4.8percent unemployment rate compared to 5.1 percent for non-RTW states (Kersey, 2007). As of
March 2010, RTW states had an average unemployment rate of 8.6% while the rate in non-RTW
states stood at 9.4% (Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], 2010).
Another aspect of the impact that RTW laws have on employment relates to the type and
condition of employment between the two types of states. The share of manufacturing employment
in the U.S. in 1950 was 35percent of the workforce. This figure declined to 13 percent in 2004
(Fischer & Rupert, 2005). Many RTW advocates believe pro-business laws, such as RTW, lessen
manufacturing losses by creating a conducive business atmosphere. While both types of states have
not been able to stem the national tide, data indicates that manufacturing employment in RTW states
has decreased at a much lower rate than in their non-RTW counterparts where manufacturing
employment has seen significant decreases. Between 2001 and 2006 the typical RTW state saw
manufacturing employment decline 1.5percent annually, equaling 7.1percent overall. Non-RTW
states, however, faced even sharper declines, averaging 3.0 percent annually and 13.7 percent over the
five year period. Every non-RTW state but one, Alaska, lost manufacturing jobs during that period,
while five RTW states registered at least modest gains in this area (Wright, 2007).
In terms of job conditions, the government data shows that in 2003 the rate of workplace
fatalities per 100,000 workers was highest in right-to-work states. The rate of workplace deaths is 51
percent higher in RTW states (BLS, 2006). Nineteen of the top 25 states for worker fatality rates
were RTW states, while three of the bottom 25 states were RTW states (Bureau of Labor Statistics
[BLS], 2003). Further, in a study of New York City construction site fatalities, it was found that 93
percent of deaths happened at non-union sites (Walter, 2007). The same holds true in the coal
mining industry where 87 percent of fatalities between 2007 and 2009 occurred at non-union mines
(U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor, 2007).
Right-to-Work and Job Growth
Holmes (1998) argues that large manufacturing establishments are more likely to be attracted
to RTW states because larger plants are more likely to be unionized. RTW laws, according to
manufacturers, help maintain competiveness and encourage development in the strained sector. He
also found that eight of the ten states with the highest manufacturing employment growth rates are
RTW states. All ten states with the lowest growth rates are non-RTW states. Opponents charge that
the laws depress individual worker wages at the expense of profits and capitalist objectives. From
1977 through 1999, Gross State Product (GSP), the market value of all goods and services produced
in a state, increased 0.5 percent faster in RTW states than in non-RTW states (Wilson, 2002).
Right-to-Work Laws and Wages
One condition of employment is the impact of RTW laws on wages. This includes both
absolute wages and the overall wage distribution across income and racial lines following RTW
passage. There are currently 132,604,980 workers in the United States (U.S.). The American worker,
as of July 2009, earned an average of $44,901 per year. This translates in to an average hourly wage
of $22.36 (Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], 2009).
Leading researchers disagree on the impact of RTW laws on wages. For example, 16 of the
18 states are estimated to have had higher average wages in 2000 as a result of their RTW status
(Reed, 2003). On the other hand, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data reveals that average annual
pay is higher in non-RTW states. In addition, income polarization is higher in RTW states, with a
higher percentage of workers earning the minimum wage (even when controlling for education level)
than in non-RTW states. After years of economic development, the portion of heads of household
earning around the minimum wage is still 35.5 percent (4.4 percentage points) higher in RTW than in
high-union-density states"" (Cassell, 2001).
Lawrence Mishel (2001) of the Economic Policy Institute found that in 2000 the median
wage for workers living in RTW states was $11.45, while wages for those living in non -RTW states
were $13.00, indicating that wages were 11.9 percent lower in RTW states. He further concluded that
previous research citing wage increases in RTW states were directly attributable to the improved
income characteristics of those residing in large cities located on a state border with a non-RTW
state. At the same time, when looking at weekly and hourly wages by industry between RTW and
non-RTW states adjusted for cost-of-living, RTW states have higher wages in two key industries. For
example, in manufacturing workers in RTW states earn an average of $717 weekly and $17.89 hourly
while their non-RTW counterparts earn $672 and $16.80. In education and health services, those
amounts are $717 and $21.34 for RTW and $650 and $20.06 for non-RTW. These differing statistics
question the true RTW impact on wage increases and the quality of employment.","The text presents conflicting information on the impact of Right-to-Work laws on wages.  Some researchers suggest that 16 of 18 states had higher average wages in 2000 due to RTW status. However, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data indicates higher average annual pay in non-RTW states, with greater income polarization and a higher percentage of minimum wage earners in RTW states.  Another study found median wages 11.9 percent lower in RTW states in 2000.  Conversely, when adjusted for cost-of-living, weekly and hourly wages in manufacturing and education/health services were higher in RTW states.
","The immediate and long-term impacts of Right-to-Work (RTW) laws on employment and wages can be discerned from the provided text:

**Immediate Impacts:**

1. **Employment Rates:**
   - After the enactment of RTW laws, RTW states generally experienced lower unemployment rates than non-RTW states. For instance, between 1978 and 2000, RTW states had an average unemployment rate of 5.8% compared to 6.3% in non-RTW states. This trend persisted into the 2000s. 

2. **Type of Employment:**
   - RTW states showed a slower decline in manufacturing employment compared to non-RTW states. From 2001 to 2006, manufacturing employment in RTW states declined annually by 1.5% compared to a 3.0% decline in non-RTW states.

**Long-term Impacts:**

1. **Wages:**
   - There is disagreement among researchers about the impact of RTW laws on wages. Some studies cited higher average wages in RTW states, while others indicated lower wages compared to non-RTW states. For example, in 2000, the median wage was 11.9% lower in RTW states than in non-RTW states. However, in certain industries such as manufacturing and health services, RTW states showed higher weekly and hourly wages when adjusted for the cost of living.

2. **Job Growth:**
   - RTW laws are believed to attract large manufacturing establishments due to reduced union influence, contributing to faster manufacturing employment growth in RTW states. Eight of the ten states with the highest manufacturing employment growth rates were RTW states.

3. **Workplace Safety:**
   - RTW states have higher workplace fatality rates, with 51% higher fatality rates than non-RTW states. Most of the top states for worker fatalities are RTW states.

In summary, RTW laws have led to lower unemployment rates and slower decline in manufacturing jobs in RTW states compared to non-RTW states. However, there is a wage disparity, with some evidence suggesting lower median wages in RTW states, though certain industries in these states boast higher adjusted wages. Additionally, RTW states have been associated with higher workplace fatality rates.","Based solely on the provided text, here are the immediate and long-term impacts of Right-to-Work (RTW) laws on employment and wages:

- March 2010: 8.6% in RTW states vs. 9.4% in non-RTW states

2. Higher employment growth:
- 1970-2000: 2.9% annual increase in RTW states vs. 2.0% in non-RTW states

 [context document]","My spouse is pregnant, and I saw the term ""Apgar"" in a pamphlet at the OB's office at a recent prenatal visit. I looked up the term online and found this article. Please explain Agpar and its significance to health outcomes.","Introduction
 The Apgar score is based on five components (skin color, heart rate, reflex irritability, muscle tone, and respiration). Each item is scored from 0 to 2 with a total score of 7–10 as normal and the highest score of 10 representing the optimal condition. The Apgar score has been used worldwide as a vitality index for almost every newborn immediately after birth. 
 

 

 Methods
 Study Population
 We conducted a population-based cohort study using data from Danish national registers. A total of 2,272,473 live singletons were identified during 1978–2015 from the Danish Medical Birth Registry . We excluded 1,001 births with missing information on sex and 41,252 births with no valid information on 5-min Apgar scores (including the score of 0). We further excluded 16,398 infants who died or emigrated from Denmark before the age of 1 year. The final cohort comprised 2,213,822 births.
 

 

 Discussion
 Main Findings
 In this large population-based cohort study, during childhood, we found individuals with even clinically “normal” Apgar score range of 7–9 still had higher risks of overall mental disorders and some specific diagnoses: organic disorders and a series of neurodevelopmental disorders (intellectual disability, pervasive developmental disorders, childhood autism, and ADHD). It is also interesting to observe that compromised Apgar scores were at elevated risks of developing organic disorders and neurotic disorders, which were reported for the first time. During early adulthood, compromised 5-min Apgar scores were not found to be associated with mental disorders.
 

 Comparisons With Other Studies
 To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association of the full spectrum of mental disorders with the 5-min Apgar score. Our findings indicate the strongest associations for intellectual disability in childhood, which corroborates the results from previous studies. Most previous studies were based on results of different non-standardized intelligence tests, and cross-sectional or descriptive designs, except a recent Swedish study, by virtue of clinically confirmed diagnosis and cohort design, reporting that term infants with low 5-min Apgar score had a higher risk of severe neurologic morbidity, including a 9-fold risk of intellectual disability. However, the Swedish study only captured cases before 14 years of age and only adjusted for year of birth, maternal age, parity, and smoking. Similarly, we observed 3~5-fold risks of intellectual disability in childhood (until 18 years of age), and we were able to adjust for not only the aforementioned confounders but also parental psychiatric history and socioeconomic status, indicating a more robust association. In addition, ADHD and autism were another two widely studied neurodevelopment disorders in relation to Apgar score during childhood, but existing results were inconsistent, which may be due to heterogeneity of methodology, in particular categorizations of Apgar scores and definition of outcomes. For example, some studies used pervasive developmental disorder (ICD-10 codes: F84) as a proxy to define autism, which includes but is not limited to autism. To reduce the possibility of misclassification, we only focused on childhood autism–the typical and most severe type of autism–to explore the association. Our findings further support that compromised 5-min Apgar scores were associated with childhood autism.
 

 Furthermore, we observed that individuals with a compromised 5-min Apgar score had higher risks of organic disorder and neurotic disorder during childhood, which have not been reported previously. These findings imply that less-than-optimal Apgar scores at birth may be an indicator for a broad scope of mental disorders in childhood, not merely neurodevelopmental disorders.
 

 There have been scarce studies examining the association between low Apgar score and adulthood mental health. We did not find that compromised 5-min Apgar scores were associated with mental disorders during early adulthood, which may be attributed to incomplete records of Apgar scores during the initial establishment of the Danish Medical Birth Register (MBR). We observed that participants with suboptimal Apgar scores at 5 min tended to have higher risks of organic disorders, schizophrenia, neurotic disorders, and personality disorders, and the low statistical precisions may probably be due to limited cases in the low Apgar score groups. Considering that the maximum attained age in our study was only up to 39 years, the follow-up between 19 and 39 years was not long enough to detect some late-onset mental disorders (e.g., dementia), therefore, future studies with extended follow-up to late adulthood are warranted.
 

 Current guidelines recommend Apgar scores of 7 or higher to be reassuring, hence, infants with these scores are often assumed to constitute a homogeneous group. Nevertheless, recent studies showed that even reassuring Apgar scores of 7–9 are associated with higher risks of neonatal mortality, neonatal morbidity, and adverse long-term neurological outcomes, compared with an Apgar score of 10. We found a dose-response increasing the overall risk of mental disorders with decreasing Apgar score of 9 toward 7. Furthermore, individuals with “normal” scores of 7–9 carried increased risks of a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as intellectual disability, pervasive developmental disorders, childhood autism, and ADHD. Similarly, prior studies based on developmental screening scales found children aged 5 years with 5-min Apgar scores of 7–9 were more vulnerable on the emotional or physical health domain of the Early Development Instrument. Recently, a large transnational study also suggested that low Apgar scores of 7–9 were associated with a higher risk of autistic disorder but without controlling for socioeconomic status and paternal psychiatric history. Our findings are in line with those of previous studies by showing that reassuring Apgar scores 7–9 are associated with various neurodevelopmental disorders in childhood. These findings support that 5-min Apgar scores routinely available in contemporary neonatal settings, even within the normal range 7–9, are not totally reassuring.
 

 The causes of mental disorders are multifactorial. Adverse prenatal events (e.g., gestational diabetes mellitus, preterm, and restricted fetal growth) are important risk factors and could have a programming effect on fetal brain development, resulting in increased risk for psychopathology later in life. In this study, adjusting for gestational age at birth and fetal growth status did not substantially change the risks, indicating that preterm birth or restricted fetal growth do not strongly modify the relations between low Apgar scores at birth and subsequent mental disorders. Although Apgar scores are not clear on any causal pathway of pathogenesis, less-than-optimal Apgar scores at birth may be a potential sign of the cumulative effect of those adverse prenatal events. Especially, the clinically reassuring but suboptimal score range 7–9 may indicate subtle but still detrimental intrauterine insults which will act negatively on fetal brain development. In clinical settings, a distressed infant will receive resuscitation well before the 5-min Apgar score is assigned, so the score 7–9 could not well reflect severe conditions prior to the assessment. That may be one of the reasons we observed exposure to the scores 7–9 was associated with an increased risk of mental disorders. In this study, a novel finding that a compromised 5-min Apgar score was linked to increased risks of organic disorder and neurotic disorder was reported. Organic disorder comprises a range of mental disorders based on a demonstrable etiology in cerebral disease, brain injury, or other insults leading to cerebral dysfunction. Increased risk of organic disorder with low Apgar score implies adverse prenatal insults (e.g., hypoxia-ischemia, white matter injury, reduced blood flow, malnutrition) exert a long-lasting impact on brain function in later life. With regard to neurotic disorder, its prevalence is relevant to low levels of socioeconomic status (SES). In this study, we found individuals with compromised Apgar scores tended to be born in families with worse SES (e.g., mothers live alone and have a low education level). It is, therefore, possible that SES factors at least partially mediate the observed association between compromised Apgar scores and neurotic disorder.","The Apgar score, assessed on five factors (skin color, heart rate, reflex irritability, muscle tone, and respiration), is assigned to newborns immediately after birth, with scores ranging from 0 to 2 for each factor and a total score ranging from 0 to 10. While a score of 7-10 is considered normal, with 10 being optimal, this study found that even babies with scores of 7-9 had a higher risk of mental disorders, such as intellectual disability, pervasive developmental disorders, childhood autism, ADHD, organic disorders, and neurotic disorders, during childhood (up to 18 years of age) than babies with a score of 10.  During early adulthood (up to 39 years of age), the association between Apgar score and mental disorders was not found, though this may be due to study limitations.  Low Apgar scores may indicate adverse prenatal events that impact brain development. Even scores of 7-9 may indicate subtle but detrimental effects.  The study found a dose-response relationship between Apgar score and risk of mental disorders, with risk increasing as scores decrease from 9 to 7.  A compromised Apgar score was also linked to organic disorders (related to brain injury or dysfunction) and neurotic disorders (related to socioeconomic status).
","The Apgar score is a quick test used to evaluate the health of a newborn immediately after birth. It assesses five components: skin color, heart rate, reflex irritability, muscle tone, and respiration. Each is scored from 0 to 2, with a total score of 7-10 considered normal, and a perfect score of 10 indicating optimal condition. This scoring system is used worldwide as a vital index for newborns.

The significance of the Apgar score extends beyond immediate post-birth assessment; it has implications for long-term health outcomes. The study referenced in the article found that children with Apgar scores in the normal range of 7-9 still faced higher risks of a variety of mental disorders in childhood, such as intellectual disability, autism, and ADHD. Compromised scores, even if clinically reassuring, can be associated with broader issues, including organic and neurotic disorders, suggesting subtle but detrimental effects on fetal brain development. The findings underline the importance of considering the Apgar score as an indicator of potential risks, rather than as providing definitive assurance of health, even when the scores seem normal. 

Current guidelines favor Apgar scores of 7 or higher as reassuring, yet evidence points to increased risks even within this range compared to the optimal score of 10. This suggests that even scores considered normal may not fully eliminate risks for adverse health outcomes later in life, reinforcing the need for ongoing monitoring and consideration of prenatal factors that could influence an infant's health.","Based on the provided context, I'll explain the Apgar score and its significance to health outcomes:

The Apgar score is a standardized assessment tool used worldwide to evaluate newborns immediately after birth. It consists of five components:
1. Skin color
2. Heart rate
3. Reflex irritability
4. Muscle tone
5. Respiration

Each component is scored from 0 to 2, with a total possible score of 10, which represents the optimal condition. Scores of 7-10 are considered clinically ""normal.""

Significance to health outcomes:

1. Neurodevelopmental Impact:
- Even ""normal"" Apgar scores of 7-9 (versus 10) have been associated with higher risks of:
  - Intellectual disability
  - Pervasive developmental disorders
  - Childhood autism
  - ADHD
  - Overall mental disorders

2. Childhood Health:
- Lower Apgar scores are associated with:
  - Higher risks of organic disorders
  - Neurotic disorders
  - Increased neonatal mortality and morbidity
  - Adverse long-term neurological outcomes

3. Early Adulthood:
- The study found no significant associations between compromised Apgar scores and mental disorders in early adulthood, though this may be due to incomplete records or insufficient follow-up time.

Important to note: While scores of 7-9 are considered clinically ""normal,"" the research suggests that even these scores may not be entirely reassuring, as they show a dose-response relationship where risks increase as scores decrease from 9 toward 7.",1251,1572,1457,1426.6666666666667
415,"Use only the information provided below to formulate your answer, and format the answer using bullet points where appropriate. ",Compare the financial facts and figures of families with children to families without children.,"Many families are in financial distress, and families with children are especially
vulnerable. Thirty-eight percent of families with children under age 18 living at home
are struggling to get by, compared with 33 percent of families without children at home
(figure 1). Financial distress can arise from a range of factors, from a specific hardship—
28 percent of families with children experienced a financial hardship in the past year,
compared with 23 percent of families without children—to a simple lack of sufficient
income. Twenty-four percent of families with children spent more than their income last
year, compared with 19 percent of families without children.

Raising children is expensive, and the costs have been rising over time. According to the USDA, the
typical two-parent family can expect to spend between $13,000 and $15,000 per child per year for
children born in 2013, meaning that the average cost of raising a child is expected to be $245,000 over
18 years (Lino 2014). A family with two children can expect to spend almost half its income on its
children each year. 

Not only are children expensive, but families with children tend to have lower incomes than families
without children. In 2014, the median income for families with children was about $62,000, compared
with about $68,000 for families without children (figure 2). While men’s earnings increase after
fatherhood, women with children have lower average earnings than women without children. These
differences hold true even when looking only at working people and when controlling for years of
experience and other attributes (Budig 2014; Pal and Waldfogel 2014). As single-mother families become
more common, the “fatherhood bump” no longer offsets the “motherhood penalty” for many families. 
Public benefits are not enough to offset the increased cost of having children. Available federal
programs such as Medicaid, SNAP (the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), and TANF, as well
as tax incentives such as the EITC (the earned income tax credit) lift millions of families with children
out of poverty (Sherman, Trisi, and Parrott 2013), but they are often not enough to lift families out of
financial distress. Many of the programs that focus on families with children are shrinking, despite the
increased costs of having children. Total federal spending on children, currently 10 percent of the
federal budget, is projected to decline to less than 8 percent in 2025, while adult Social Security,
Medicare, and Medicaid spending is projected to increase to 49 percent (Isaacs et al. 2015).

Some of the differences between families with and without children at home may be attributable to
older families whose children are no longer at home or younger families who do not have children yet,
rather than adults of childrearing age without children. If we look only at families where the survey
respondent is under age 65, we see that families with and without children are equally likely to be
struggling to get by and to experience a hardship, but families with children are still more likely to spend
more than their incomes. This suggests that older families are doing better than younger families.
Because many of these adults are retired and not earning income, households headed by adults 65
years and older have a lower median income than the general population: $40,000 versus $54,000 in
2014 (US Census Bureau 2014). However, these households also have higher wealth. The mean net
worth of families headed by someone ages 65–74 was over $1 million in 2013, compared with just
$75,500 for families with heads under age 35 (Bricker et al. 2014).

Families with children are more likely to think that they are doing better than they were five years ago
than families without children (47 and 38 percent, respectively; figure 3). Yet while 47 percent of
families with children think they are doing better than they were in 2009, only 31 percent think they are
doing better than they were in 2013 (not shown). This is consistent with recovery from the recession
occurring after 2009 but before 2013. After adjusting for inflation, median incomes for families with
children decreased 1.9 percent between 2009 and 2014 while incomes for families without children
increased by 2.6 percent over the same period.

Even though families with children appear less financially healthy than years past, they are more
likely to feel their situations have improved. This feeling may reflect improved economic security as
children age and child care costs decline.","* **Financial Distress:**

THE ACCOUNTING PROFESSION 
The accounting profession has been around for hundreds of years and is incorrectly perceived as nerdy, shy, quiet people who sit and “crunch” numbers.  While accounting, by nature, does require a basic understanding of math, there is so much more to an accounting career than just numbers.  A career in accounting is challenging, but with challenge comes rewards and opportunities.  This profession can provide an exciting path to meet and work with people from different backgrounds as well as opportunities to travel the world.  Because accountants offer a specific skill-set they are typically highly compensated through competitive salaries and, in a growing number of instances, allowed flexible work schedules. 
The demand for talented, knowledgeable accountants has historically been high and is projected to increase over the next few years.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that the accounting job field will grow an additional 139,900 jobs through the year 20261.  The U.S. News and World Report ranks “Accountant” #3 on the list of “Best Business Jobs” because of the substantial salary amounts and the job security the profession provides. 2  Every business needs at least one accountant if not several accountants to help track and manage costs, assist with reporting, calculate federal, state and local tax liabilities, along with many other tasks.  Also many individuals rely on accountants to help with tax planning, personal finance and wealth building.  Because of this there are several different types of accountants that expand beyond the standard bookkeeper or tax preparer that most people associate with the term “accountant”. 

AREAS OF ACCOUNTING
The accounting profession can be broken between public accountants and private accountants.  Regardless if someone goes into public or private accounting, each professional must have certain skills above and beyond the education requirements.  Most accountants must be detailed oriented, have the ability to organize and manage time effectively.  Those that work in accounting, contrary to the typical accountant stereotype, must also have outstanding people skills and be able to communicate effectively.  Additionally, each business and public accounting firm use different software when performing different job duties; therefore, accountants must be knowledgeable and comfortable with computers and have the capability to learn new systems quickly.  All accountants are expected to be proficient in Microsoft Office especially Microsoft Excel.  Also, successful accountants are analytical.  They can think beyond the numbers and assist with making businesses more efficient.  Below highlights the differences, lists the potential career paths and salary information for public vs. private accountants.   

Public Accounting:   
- Definition:  accountants that serve businesses, governments, non-profits, and individuals by providing various accounting services.  Those services include tax return preparation, financial statement preparation, financial statement audit or review, and various consulting related to business transactions.   
- Requirements:  These accountants typically have a bachelor’s degree in accounting.  Most individuals that work in public accounting must be a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and be licensed with the state. 
- Why choose public accounting?  It’s called public accounting because these accountants work with the public and must be able to communicate effortlessly.  Public accountants work continuously with colleagues to complete projects as well as with clients to meet their specific needs.  Those that choose public accounting are typically outgoing personalities that are also highly driven, goal oriented, and have a passion for serving others.  It should be noted that usually it is easier for an accounting career to move from public accounting to private accounting (it’s challenging to go from private accounting to public without having to start over again in lower entry level positions).  
- Public accounting has various options in-and-of itself.  While public accounting firms offer a variety of services, the main services provided fall under tax preparation and audits of financial statements.  These are very different and require different skill sets. 
o Tax preparers must be knowledgeable in local, state and federal tax laws. However, they do more than just tax return preparation.  Tax professionals work with businesses as well as individuals assisting with tax planning, financial planning, estate planning, and tax research.  Tax preparers have steady work all through-out the year but work through a “busy season” from January through April 15th. These individuals mostly work out of the firm’s office but must be willing to do some travel to visit clients. 
o Auditors must be knowledgeable in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). These auditors provide an opinion on whether or not a business’s financial statements have been prepared according to GAAP.  Auditors typically must gather information and complete their audits on location in the client’s office which could take days, weeks or months depending on the size of the client and the service being provided.  Therefore, an auditor must be willing to travel and work in close proximity with others.  Auditors also have steady work through-out the year but have periodic busy seasons depending on the type of clients they have.  

Private/Corporate Accounting:   
-  Definition:  accountants that work inside a business, governmental entity or a non-profit that use financial accounting and/or managerial accounting knowledge to build financial statements and other reports to assist in evaluating various business decisions.   
-Requirements:  These accountants typically have a bachelor’s degree in accounting.  Those that want to separate themselves from the rest will go on and receive a master’s degree and/or a professional accounting license.  
- Below are some (not all) typical job titles that fall in the area of private/corporate accounting: 
o Bookkeeper 
o Billing Clerk 
o Payroll Clerk 
o Inventory Analyst 
o Purchasing Manager
o Collections Clerk 
o General Accountant 
o Cost Accountant 
o Tax Accountant 
o Internal Auditor 
o IT Auditor 
o Controller 
o Treasurer 
o Chief Financial Officer 
- Why choose private/corporate accounting?  From the small sample of job titles above it can be noted that corporate accounting provides a vast amount of options for those that want to work inside a business or other organization.  Many people are drawn to corporate accounting because they have more flexibility to design a career path that truly incorporates their interests whether it be cost management, tax compliance, account receivable management, etc.  These accountants must still be able to work with others but in some positions, corporate accounting does provide a quieter, more secluded work space compared to public accounting.  Additionally, many corporate accounting positions do not require a CPA license or a master’s degree making it easier to enter an accounting career (However, the CPA license, other professional accounting licenses and/or a Master’s degree will make it easier to move up in an accounting career.)  ","Public accountants serve external clients including businesses, governments, non-profits, and individuals, while private/corporate accountants work internally for a specific business, government entity, or non-profit organization.  Public accountants often require a CPA license and licensure with the state, unlike private/corporate accountants.  Public accounting emphasizes client interaction and communication, contrasting with the potentially quieter work environment sometimes found in private/corporate accounting. While a move from public to private accounting is common, the reverse is less so.  Public accounting offers specialized career paths in tax preparation and audits of financial statements, each with distinct knowledge requirements and work patterns, while private accounting has a wider range of roles from bookkeeping to Chief Financial Officer.  A master's degree or professional licenses, while not always required, are beneficial for advancement in private accounting, unlike public accounting where the CPA license is often mandatory.
","Public accounting and private/corporate accounting differ in several key ways:

1. **Clientele and Services**:
   - **Public Accounting**: Provides services to a wide range of clients including businesses, governments, non-profits, and individuals. Services include tax return preparation, financial statement audits, and consulting related to business transactions.
   - **Private/Corporate Accounting**: Works within a specific organization, such as a business, governmental entity, or non-profit, focusing on internal processes like financial and managerial accounting to assist in business decision-making.

2. **Certification Requirements**:
   - **Public Accounting**: Individuals typically need to become Certified Public Accountants (CPAs) and be licensed with the state.
   - **Private/Corporate Accounting**: Although not always required, having a CPA license or a master’s degree can benefit career advancement, but many positions do not mandate these qualifications.

3. **Work Environment**:
   - **Public Accounting**: Involves working with multiple clients and often requires travel to client sites, especially for auditors who may spend extended periods working at a client's location.
   - **Private/Corporate Accounting**: Generally, work is conducted within the single business or organization employing the accountant, often providing a more stable work environment with potentially less travel.

4. **Career Paths and Opportunities**:
   - **Public Accounting**: Offers career options that include tax preparation and auditing. Typically characterized by busy seasons, such as the tax season for tax preparers.
   - **Private/Corporate Accounting**: Provides diverse roles such as bookkeeper, payroll clerk, cost accountant, internal auditor, controller, and CFO, allowing for a more tailored career path suited to specific interests.

5. **Professional Dynamics**:
   - **Public Accounting**: Often involves continuous collaboration with colleagues and clients, requiring strong communication skills and a client-oriented approach.
   - **Private/Corporate Accounting**: While still requiring teamwork, some positions may afford more solitary work settings and focus on internal business processes.

6. **Ease of Transition Between Fields**:
   - **Public to Private**: It is generally easier to transition from public accounting to private accounting later in a career.
   - **Private to Public**: Transitioning from private to public accounting can be challenging, often requiring starting over at lower-level positions.","Based on the provided context, here are the key differences between public accounting and private/corporate accounting:

Public Accounting:
1. Serves multiple businesses, governments, non-profits, and individuals as clients
2. Typically requires CPA licensure and state licensing
3. Involves more travel, especially for auditors who work at client locations
4. Has defined busy seasons (particularly January through April 15th for tax preparers)
5. Focuses mainly on tax preparation and financial statement audits
6. Requires more outgoing personalities and strong communication skills due to constant client interaction

Private/Corporate Accounting:
1. Works within a single organization
2. Does not typically require CPA license or master's degree for entry-level positions
3. Offers more varied job titles and specialized roles (like Bookkeeper, Billing Clerk, Cost Accountant, etc.)
4. Provides more secluded work environment compared to public accounting
5. Allows more flexibility to focus on specific areas of interest
6. Work is typically performed at one location within the organization

Revolutionizing the Retail Experience
Introduction
In recent years, the retail industry has witnessed a significant shift towards online shopping. The
emergence of E-commerce platforms has transformed the way consumers shop, providing
convenience and access to a wide range of products. This case study explores the rise of Temu, a
shopping app that has disrupted the traditional retail landscape and revolutionized the shopping
experience for millions of users.
Temu, a rising star in the world of online shopping, offers a vast array of fashion products, beauty
items, and home goods. This Chinese-owned digital marketplace has quickly become the top free
shopping app, outshining giants like Shein, Amazon, and Walmart. Temu’s business model
connects customers directly to suppliers. By forging strong relationships with retailers, they’ve
managed to keep prices low and maintain a vast network of suppliers. At the core of Temu’s rapid
growth and competitive pricing is their innovative Next-Gen Manufacturing (NGM) model. Launched
in September 2022, this Boston-based e-commerce platform serves markets in the US, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand. The NGM model revolutionizes the retail process by enabling
manufacturers to produce merchandise with more precision, reducing unsold inventory and waste.
However customers do complain about longer delivery times. It is unknown to what extent this is a
result of the NGM model. By connecting shoppers directly with manufacturers and offering real-time
insights, Temu is able to cut warehousing and transportation costs, resulting in savings of at least
50% compared to traditional processes. This cost-saving approach allows the company to offer
near-wholesale prices, as they remove hidden costs and focus on accurately forecasting sales and
demand.
While Temu.com is gaining popularity, it faces stiff competition from other Chinese online wholesale
stores like AliExpress, DHGate, Banggood, and DealExtreme. These platforms offer a wide range
of products at competitive prices, along with diverse shipping options and payment methods.
However, Temu stands out with its NGM model, which empowers manufacturers to create
customized products. The increased visibility of demand and supply accelerates distribution and
eliminates the need for large warehouses. Another distinguishing factor of Temu is its claims on
sustainability and social responsibility. The NGM model promotes a more sustainable e-commerce
landscape by enabling manufacturers to produce merchandise that fits the needs of consumers,
leading to lower unsold inventory and waste.
Significance of Temu’s Innovative approach to Shopping
In the rapidly evolving world of e-commerce, convenience and speed have become the pillars on
which success is built. As consumers increasingly turn to online shopping to meet their needs, the
demand for faster shopping times has never been higher. Enter TEMU, the innovative new ecommerce platform that promises to redefine the shopping experience with lightning-fast shipping.
TEMU's shopping prowess to traditional e-commerce platforms, makes it stand out and elevates the
shopping journey for customers.
Speed of Delivery:
One of the most glaring advantages TEMU brings to the table is its lightning-fast shipping times.
Unlike traditional platforms that often offer standard shipping that can take days or even weeks,
TEMU has set a new standard with its express delivery options. With strategically located
warehouses and a streamlined logistics network, TEMU ensures that customers receive their orders
in record time, sometimes as soon as within a few hours of placing an order. This kind of speed sets
TEMU apart from traditional e-commerce platforms, where delays in processing and shipping can
often lead to frustration and disappointment for customers.
Inventory Management:
TEMU's commitment to swift delivery is closely tied to its advanced inventory management system.
Traditional platforms often struggle to keep up with the demand, leading to instances where popular
items are out of stock or on backorder. TEMU's innovative approach utilizes real-time data analytics
to predict customer demands and stock products accordingly. This approach significantly reduces
the chances of running out of stock, thus ensuring that customers can find what they want when
they want it.
Customer Satisfaction:
In the world of e-commerce, customer satisfaction is paramount. TEMU's emphasis on fast shipping
addresses one of the most common pain points for online shoppers – the waiting game. Traditional
platforms often face challenges in providing consistent shipping times, leading to varied customer
experiences. TEMU's commitment to speedy delivery contributes to higher levels of customer
satisfaction by providing a more reliable and predictable shopping experience.
Competitive Edge:
As e-commerce continues to grow, the market becomes increasingly saturated with both established
giants and new entrants. TEMU's focus on faster shipping times gives it a distinct competitive edge.
It appeals to consumers who prioritize efficiency and convenience in their shopping experience. In
contrast, traditional platforms may find themselves having to adapt quickly or risk losing customers
to the allure of TEMU's swiffer service.
Sustainability and Environmental Impact:
While speed is a significant selling point for TEMU, it's essential to consider the environmental
impact of such rapid shipping. Expedited shipping often requires additional resources, such as
expedited transportation and packaging materials. Traditional platforms might adopt more
sustainable shipping practices, such as grouping orders or optimizing delivery routes to reduce their
carbon footprint. TEMU must balance its commitment to speed with environmental responsibility to
ensure a positive long-term impact.
Brief Overview of Temu
Temu (pronounced ‘tee-moo’) is a Boston-based online marketplace founded by Pinduoduo’s parent
company PDD Holding. Its business model is likened to Chinese shopping platforms SHEIN, Wish,
and Alibaba – which are based on the sale of large quantities of products at prices that are so low
they are almost unbelievable. Temu was founded in the USA in 2022 and is a subsidiary of PDD
Holdings Inc., which is listed on Nasdaq and headquartered in Shanghai. Temu operates as an
online marketplace similar to AliExpress, Walmart, and Wish, focusing on offering affordable goods.
Temu allows Chinese vendors to sell to shoppers and ship directly to them without having to store
products in U.S. warehouses.The company acts as an intermediary between sellers (primarily from
China) and buyers without maintaining its own inventory. Temu promotes social commerce,
encouraging potential buyers to find more buyers to avail discounts. The app employs gamification
to engage customers and offers free shipping by circumventing customs duties. The platform allows
suppliers based in China to sell and ship directly to customers without having to rely on warehouses
in the destination countries . Online purchases on Temu can be made using a web browser or via a
dedicated mobile application.Temu offers free products to some users which encourage new people
to install the app through affiliate codes, social media and gamification. It also uses online
advertising on Facebook and Instagram and many online platforms. The Temu platform went live
for the first time in the United States in September 2022 and in February 2023, Temu was launched
in Canada. That same month, the company aired a Super Bowl commercial advert . In March 2023,
Temu was launched in Australia and New Zealand. The following month, Temu was launched in
France , Italy , Germany , the Netherlands , Spain and the United Kingdom.
Naturally, the prices charged by the site defy all competition (sneakers for €11, manicure kit for less
than €5, phone holder for €1.80, etc.), so much so that the platform has adopted an eloquent slogan:
“Buy like a Billionaire”. As the specialist in Chinese digital companies Jeffrey Towson explains to Le
Monde, the platform does not yet make a margin, in order to establish itself quickly in the targeted
countries.
At the end of 2022, the Temu application became the most downloaded application in the United
States. The TEMU (Shop Like a Millionaire) Shopping app is now boasting over 100 million
Downloads on PlayStore and AppStore with over 4.7 Million reviews and about 12+ Ratings. Three
months after its launch in the United States, the application was at the top of downloads. In the
European Union, where the platform arrived in April (in France, the United Kingdom, Italy, the
Netherlands, Spain and Germany), the success is similar. In recent days, it has been the most
downloaded application in France on iOS and Android.
As of April 2023, the app has been downloaded 10 million times since its launch in September 2022
and it is currently available in around 100 countries. Temu’s wide range of products is particularly
appealing to consumers, combined with a gamified online shopping experience that encourages
customers to try their luck and buy more and more. With its impressive growth and distinct strategy,
Temu’s business model warrants a closer look.
Key Factors that contributed to its initial success
Leveraging the power of mobile technology, Temu aimed to bridge the gap between online and
offline retail, offering a unique platform that combined the benefits of both worlds. It introduced
several innovative features for better customer experience that set it apart from competitors and
propelled its rapid rise to popularity. These Key Features and Functionality are;
Augmented Reality (AR) Shopping:
Temu integrated AR technology into its app, allowing users to virtually try on clothing, visualize
furniture in their homes, and experience products before making a purchase. This feature enhanced
the shopping experience and reduced the need for physical store visits.
Personalized Recommendations:
Temu leveraged artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences,
browsing history, and purchase behavior. Based on these insights, the app provided personalized
product recommendations to users, leading to higher customer satisfaction and increased
sales.Certainly! Temu's personalized recommendations were generated through a combination of
artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning algorithms. Here's an overview of how the feature
worked:
Data Collection:
Temu collected vast amounts of user data to understand individual preferences and behavior. This
data included user interactions within the app, such as product searches, views, clicks, and
purchases, as well as demographic information and user-provided preferences.
Data Processing and Analysis:
The collected data was processed and analyzed using AI and machine learning algorithms. These
algorithms examined patterns, correlations, and relationships within the data to identify user
preferences, interests, and buying patterns.
User Profiling:
Based on the analysis, Temu created user profiles that encompassed various attributes, such as
preferred product categories, brands, price ranges, and style preferences. The profiles were
continually updated and refined as new data was collected and analyzed.
Collaborative Filtering:
One common technique used by Temu was collaborative filtering. This approach compares a user's
profile with the profiles of other similar users to identify products or items that users with similar
preferences enjoyed or purchased. By finding similarities between users, collaborative filtering could
suggest relevant products to a particular user based on the preferences of users with similar tastes.
Content-Based Filtering:
Another technique employed by Temu was content-based filtering. This method focused on the
characteristics and attributes of products themselves. It analyzed product descriptions, features,
tags, and other metadata to identify similarities and correlations between products. For example, if
a user showed a preference for certain brands or specific features, content-based filtering could
recommend similar products that match those preferences.
Machine Learning and Iterative Refinement:
Temu's algorithms continuously learned and improved over time. As users interacted with the app
and provided feedback, the algorithms adjusted their recommendations based on the user's
responses and behavior. Machine learning techniques enabled the system to adapt and refine its
recommendations based on real-time user feedback.
Real-Time Contextual Factors:
In addition to user preferences, Temu also considered real-time contextual factors, such as trending
products, seasonal trends, and popular items in the user's location. These factors were incorporated
into the recommendation algorithms to ensure up-to-date and relevant suggestions.
By leveraging AI, machine learning, and user data, Temu's personalized recommendation system
aimed to understand each user's unique preferences and deliver tailored product suggestions. The
algorithms continually evolved to provide increasingly accurate and relevant recommendations,
enhancing the user experience and facilitating personalized shopping journeys.
Social Commerce Integration:
Recognizing the power of social media, Temu incorporated social commerce features, enabling
users to share products, create wish lists, and seek recommendations from friends and influencers.
This integration expanded Temu's reach and facilitated organic growth through user-generated
content.
Seamless Checkout and Delivery:
Temu prioritized a frictionless shopping experience by streamlining the checkout process and
offering multiple secure payment options. Additionally, it partnered with reliable logistics providers
to ensure prompt and efficient product delivery, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.
Seamless Checkout and Payment Options:
Temu focused on streamlining the checkout process to provide a seamless and hassle-free
experience for users. It offered multiple secure payment options, including credit/debit cards, mobile
wallets, and payment gateways, allowing users to choose their preferred method. This flexibility and
ease of payment contributed to a smoother transaction process and reduced cart abandonment
rates.Temu implemented several measures to ensure the security of payment options for its users;
Secure Payment Gateways: Temu has partnered with trusted and secure payment gateways to
handle the processing of user payments. These payment gateways employ robust security
measures such as encryption, tokenization, and secure socket layer (SSL) protocols to protect
sensitive payment information during transmission.
Encryption:
Temu has implemented encryption protocols to safeguard user payment data. This involves
encrypting sensitive information such as credit card details, bank account numbers, and personal
information to prevent unauthorized access or interception. Encryption ensures that even if the data
is intercepted, it remains unreadable and unusable to unauthorized parties.
Compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI DSS):
Temu has adhered to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards, which are industry-wide
standards established to ensure the secure handling of cardholder data. Compliance with PCI DSS
involves maintaining a secure network, implementing strong access controls, regularly monitoring
and testing systems, and maintaining an information security policy.
Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
Temu has implemented two-factor authentication as an additional layer of security for payment
transactions. This requires users to provide two forms of verification, such as a password and a
unique code sent to their mobile device, to authenticate their identity before completing a payment.
Fraud Detection Systems:
Temu has employed fraud detection systems and algorithms to identify and prevent fraudulent
payment activities. These systems analyze various factors, such as user behavior, transaction
patterns, and known fraud indicators, to detect and flag suspicious transactions for further
verification or intervention.
Regular Security Audits:
Temu has conducted regular security audits and assessments to identify vulnerabilities and ensure
that all payment systems and processes meet the highest security standards. This includes
conducting penetration testing, code reviews, and vulnerability scans to proactively identify and
address any potential security weaknesses.
User Education and Awareness:
Temu has implemented user education programs to raise awareness about safe online payment
practices. This could include educating users about the importance of strong passwords, avoiding
phishing attempts, and regularly monitoring their payment transactions for any unauthorized activity.
Order Tracking and Delivery Updates:
Temu provided users with real-time order tracking and delivery updates. Users could monitor the
progress of their orders and receive notifications regarding shipment status, estimated delivery time,
and any delays. This feature enhanced transparency and kept users informed throughout the
delivery process, improving overall customer satisfaction.
User Reviews and Ratings:
To facilitate informed purchasing decisions, Temu incorporated user reviews and ratings for
products. Users could leave feedback and rate their purchases, helping others make well-informed
choices. This feature added a layer of trust and credibility to the shopping experience and fostered
a community-driven approach to product evaluation.
Virtual Stylist and Fashion Advice:
Temu introduced a virtual stylist feature that offered personalized fashion advice and styling tips.
Users could provide information about their preferences, body type, and occasion, and receive
tailored recommendations for outfits and accessories. This feature catered to users seeking fashion
inspiration and guidance, enhancing their shopping experience. Temu’s Virtual Stylist feature works
in the following ways;
It helps Users of the Temu app to create a profile by providing information about their preferences,
body type, style preferences, and any specific fashion requirements they may have.
The virtual stylist feature uses algorithms and machine learning techniques to analyze the user's
profile and understand their style preferences. It considers factors such as color preferences,
patterns, clothing types, and previous purchases.
The feature assists users in recommendations. Based on the user's profile and preferences, the
virtual stylist recommends outfits, clothing items, or accessories that align with their style. These
recommendations may include images, descriptions, and links to purchase the recommended items.
The feature also provides style tips, fashion trends, and suggestions to help users stay updated and
make informed fashion choices.
It helps users in Interactive Communication. The virtual stylist often offers Interactive
communication channels such as chatbots or messaging systems. Users ask questions, seek
styling advice, or provide feedback to further refine the recommendations.
The feature helps Integration with User Feedback,it learns and improves over time by incorporating
user feedback and preferences. As users interact with the feature, their feedback and engagement
help train the algorithm to provide more accurate and personalized recommendations
Growth and Adoption over time
Temu was ranked No. 12 in the 2022 holiday traffic, topping retailers like Kohl’s and Wayfair. With
an average of 41.0 million visitors in November and December, Temu surpassed major ecommerce
sites like Kohl’s, Wayfair, and Nordstrom, and was within striking distance of Macy’s. Temu surged
ahead of low-price Chinese goods sellers Shein and Wish.com in dramatic fashion. Not only did
Temu quickly surpass Wish.com amid its recent downswing, it also managed to leapfrog Shein’s
impressive recent gains. Shein’s steady rise has the company now looking to raise capital at a
reported $64 billion valuation as reported by Reuters. Wish.com, by comparison, has been
hemorrhaging money and has plummeted 98% from its peak stock price, with a market cap below
$400 million. Using cheap wares to attract customers can work, but profitability is a challenge when
operating under tight margins. High acquisition costs can be a killer, and there will also be a need
to pivot into higher-margin goods.
Temu is keying on its mobile app for loyalty. Temu’s bargain-basement prices make purchases a
low consideration in most cases. Its best use case is when customers realize a need (“Shoot, I left
my iPhone charger at the hotel and need another one”) and can buy quickly and cheaply. The app
can drive habit formation around this, and the more that shoppers rely on the app the less likely
Temu will have to pay for ads to drive conversions.
Temu exploded out of the gates and its rapid rise warrants attention. As something of a Wish.com
clone, there’s reason to be skeptical it can find long-term profitable growth when its early stage
capital eventually rationalizes. Whether Temu avoids a similar fate will come down to whether it can
improve upon the Wish.com playbook to build a loyal and engaged user base and drastically reduce
customer acquisition costs over time. A killer TikTok strategy and sticky mobile app was key to
achieving what its predecessor could not.
As originally featured in the Retail Daily newsletter, Amazon has been the most downloaded
shopping app in the US for a very long time. It managed to beat local competitors like Walmart, and
even international competition from apps like Wish. But with the coming of Temu it looked like
Amazon had finally met its match. Going all the way back to 2020, Amazon's shopping app was
averaging around 550K downloads per week in the US, according to our estimates. The summer of
2022 was strong, pushing Amazon's downloads to more than double with a range between 800K
and 1.2M weekly downloads. And that spike didn't slow down until February, 2023, after which
downloads really started sloping down.
SHEIN, a clothing retailer that sells ""fast fashion"" shipped from China, has been chasing Amazon's
tail since it launched. Key word being ""chasing"". SHEIN averaged a little over half of Amazon's
downloads back in 2020. They got close a few times but not enough to really take the lead. In
January of 2023, that changed and SHEIN's downloads are now about double those of Amazon in
the US. SHEIN saw 617K downloads from the App Store + Google Play in the US last week,
according to our estimates. And SHEIN isn't even Amazon's biggest threat right now but Temu, a
China-based retailer that sells a variety of goods, from clothes to furniture, at very low prices, since
its launch late last year. The holiday shopping season was big for Temu. It averaged 2M new
downloads every week between November and December, according to our estimates. Downloads
dropped since, which makes sense overall, but are still astronomically high in comparison. Temu
saw 1.3M new downloads last week in the US. This is a big problem for Amazon which may mean
the next Prime Day will be a little more exciting than the last few. And yes, Temu is one of the biggest
spends on Apple Search Ads which helps it get those downloads.
Challenges Addressed by Temu
The traditional retail model is almost getting outdated thereby posing several challenges. While the
“customer is always right” mantra has held true for quite some time, the amount of power wielded
by consumers has never been higher than it is right now. Customers are no longer forced to choose
between just a couple of options when looking to purchase new luxury goods. Not only has the
number of retailers expanded exponentially in recent years, but so has the information available to
customers. The amount of choice people enjoy today has also led to a waning of brand loyalty, with
customers switching between retailers and online/in-store channels from purchase to purchase,
depending which best serves their needs at the time. Luxury retailers are not immune to this trend
either, as even wealthy customers now tend to shop around for the best option. This decline in brand
loyalty customers presents a unique retailing problem, as retailers try to find new and innovative
ways to appeal to buyers – both existing and potential;
Consumers are Choosing Multichannel Buying Experiences:
With more complete e-retail experiences available, and shipping times greatly reduced, it is little
wonder around 96% of Americans utilize online shopping in one way or another. However, those
same Americans spend about 65% of their total shopping budget in traditional brick-and-mortar
locations. In other words, while almost everyone is shopping online, they are making more
purchases in stores. Customers are moving seamlessly between online and offline experiences,
and are open to retailers who can best facilitate these transitions. Closing the divide between online
and offline retail, Temu solves some issues. It is focused on creating a second-to-none customer
experience across all channels. Customers are looking for retailers they can trust to deliver
exceptional service time and again. They have the right customer which has helped them to create
an omnichannel customer experience for consumers to interact wherever and however they wish
by incorporating real-time feedback across channels and devices – engaging the customer wherever
they may be.
Customers Expect a Seamless Experience:
When transitioning between online and in-store experiences, customers not only want the same
products to be available, they also want their experience to be seamless. This means, if they are a
regular online customer, they want to be treated like a regular customer when they visit a brick-andmortar location. This is quite problematic. However, Temu has created this type of fluid online/offline
experience for their customers, it has ceased pitting its channels against one another. Centralized
customer data has helped it build a seamless, fluid experience beginning with an easily-accessible
customer profile.
Retailers lacks an outstanding Experience To Attract Customer Loyalty:
Customer experience is the biggest contributor towards brand loyalty, the Traditional Retail model
makes it difficult to build a good customer experience.Negative experience being the most significant
factor in affecting a customer’s likelihood to make a repeat visit. Most customers also serve people
in their own working lives, meaning when they are on the other side of the counter, they want to feel
important.While promotions and offers can certainly contribute towards helping customers feel like
they are special, the real key to an outstanding experience is personalization which the retail model
falls short of. Getting to know customers from their previous purchases and interests can help
retailers drive loyalty. These insights can be gleaned from data, or even a simple conversation.Temu
addresses this challenge by rendering coupons, bonuses and reduced cost to existing and new
customers. It is equally personalized with the user.
A Siloed Marketing Infrastructure Makes It Expensive and Unwieldy to get Your Message Across;
The traditional retail model features separate channels, which makes customer data to become
siloed very easily. If all the moving parts of a marketing department are not communicating efficiently
and working together, customers become overwhelmed with conflicting or repeated messages. This
bombardment of marketing communications has easily had the opposite of the intended effect and
driven customers to competitors with a clearer and more congruent message. The right technology
and communication procedures can ensure all arms of a marketing team are on the same page.
Temu as a modern retailer has been engaging with their customers across many different channels.
From SMS, to email and social media, multi-channel communications are essential to engagement
which, in turn, drives the creation of the perfect customer experience.
So Many Technologies Exist to Drive Marketing and Sales, but They Don’t Seem to Work Together:
While the amount of data gathered by businesses keeps growing at an alarming rate, the number
of staff available to analyze it is staying more-or-less the same. What’s important, then, is making
sure all this data is being used in the correct way and not contributing towards the data silo problem.
This means finding a technology solution which can handle the huge amount of data being
generated and ensure it is focused in a direction which best benefits rather than overwhelms
marketing efforts. The data scientist approach to marketing is only going to become more prevalent
as time goes on when creating a truly unified omnichannel service.Temu has ensured that all
existing technologies work together which is why they get best results.
Only in the combining of streamlined un-siloed data science, seamless cross-channel customer
service and marketing, and authentic personalization, can traditional retailers create buyer
experiences which can combat the fickle nature of the modern consumer and lead just like Temu.
Strategies Implemented to Revolutionize The Retail Industry
Temu adopted and implemented some strategies which accounted for its success. Temu’s business
model is built around low prices. It offers even more discounts and lower prices than SHEIN, with
special offers such as items sold for as little as one cent. Temu further differentiates itself by offering
free shipping and returns to customers, which is made possible by PDD Holding’s extensive network
of suppliers and shipping partners. An efficient logistics network is not to be underestimated, as
problems with supply and distribution networks are seen as a major factor in the failure of Alibaba
and Wish to break into the Western market.. Aside this, the following strategies were implemented;
Combining Shopping and Entertainment:
One-fifth of online shoppers in the U.S. say they miss the in-store shopping experience when they
shop online. Temu aimed to bridge this gap and introduced games into the shopping process. By
playing games like Fishland, Coin Spin, Card Flip, and others, customers can win rewards that
ultimately lead to more time spent on the site and a dopamine rush from winning free items. To keep
people playing these games, however, the app relies heavily on referrals, another core business
strategy. These games were designed to be simple, addictive, rewarding, and increase user
engagement and retention. According to app intelligence firm Sensor Tower, Temu’s average daily
sessions per user in the US increased by 23% from October 2022 to January 2023. Some other
games in Canada include scratch cards, card games, and cash games.
Temu: Shared Shopping Experience:
Group Buying is a familiar concept in Asia that Temu has extended to its Western customer base.
Essentially, it has increased customers’ bargaining power by forming groups to share a bulk
discount. This plays into the aforementioned referral program, which gives discounts to customers
who bring new clients to the app and enables a shared shopping experience.
Affiliate Programs and Heavy Advertising:
As SHEIN had already proven effective, Temu sent free items to a large number of influencers and
micro-influencers to promote Temu on YouTube and TikTok. A younger customer base of users
under the age of 35 is particularly attractive to Temu, as younger consumers are typically less able
and willing to pay large sums for products. Seeing a favorite internet personality or a personal
acquaintance promoting the products has led to many young customers to imitate the purchase.
Temu’s omnipresence on TikTok and YouTube is seen as a key factor in why this marketplace has
taken off so quickly.
A strong presence on TikTok and YouTube:
Temu has leveraged the power of social media platforms, especially TikTok and YouTube, to spread
awareness and generate buzz about its products and offers. The hashtag #temu on TikTok has
amassed over 1.3 billion views, while Temu’s official YouTube account videos have grossed over
215 million views since last August. Temu’s marketing strategy relies on creating viral content that
showcases its products entertainingly and engagingly, such as unboxing videos, product reviews,
challenges, and giveaways. Temu also collaborates with influencers and celebrities with large
followings on these platforms.
Temu’s Audience:
Temu’s primary target audience has been the young and price-conscious generation of online
shoppers looking for bargains and discounts. According to a report by Daxue Consulting, the
majority of Temu’s followers (32.68%) are aged 25-34, followed by 18-24 (28.57%) and 35-44
(21.43%). Temu appeals to these consumers by offering personalized recommendations based on
their preferences and browsing history and gamified features that allow them to earn credits, gifts,
and better deals by playing in-app games or inviting their friends to join the app.
Referrals: A Win-Win Strategy for Users and Temu
Temu has implemented a referral program encouraging users to invite friends and contacts to join
the app in exchange for credits and gifts. Users can share their referral links or codes on social
media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. For example, users can join a “Fashion
Lovers” team and get $20 in credits by inviting five friends who also love fashion within 24 hours.
These referrals help users save money on their purchases, help Temu acquire new customers, and
expand its network of sellers.
Temu’s Marketing and Growth Strategy that led to its Rise
Temu's growth has been remarkable in a short period of time. It reached the top downloads in the
shopping category of both Apple's App Store and Google Play and is quickly establishing itself as a
high-potential and innovative player in the e-commerce industry. Its success is ultimately its low
prices, unlocked by their innovative Next-Gen Manufacturing (NGM) model. It employed a multifaceted marketing strategy to drive user acquisition and brand awareness which has been working
greatly for them;
Influencer Collaborations:
To reach a wider audience, Temu has been collaborating with popular social media influencers and
celebrities who promoted the app and shared their shopping experiences. Influencers came from a
wide range of individuals, including fashion bloggers, lifestyle influencers, beauty gurus, tech
enthusiasts, or experts in specific product categories.This strategy generated buzz and created a
sense of credibility and trust among potential users.
This marketing strategy was successfully implemented through;
Influencer Selection: Temu carefully identified and selected influencers who aligned with its target
audience, brand values, and product offerings. These influencers typically had a strong online
presence, a relevant niche or expertise, and a sizable following. Temu considered factors such as
engagement rates, authenticity, and the influencer's ability to create appealing and relatable content.
Exclusive Partnerships: Temu forged exclusive partnerships with influencers, often signing them
as brand ambassadors or collaborators. These collaborations involved long-term commitments,
where influencers actively promoted Temu's app and its features on their social media platforms,
websites, or blogs. The exclusivity of these partnerships helped establish a strong association
between the influencers and Temu, increasing brand loyalty and credibility.
Sponsored Content: Temu engaged influencers to create sponsored content that showcased the
app's features, user experience, and the benefits of using Temu for shopping. Influencers shared
their personal experiences, demonstrated the app's functionalities, and highlighted the unique
advantages of using Temu over other shopping platforms. This content was often shared through
blog posts, social media posts, videos, and live streams.
Product Reviews and Recommendations: Influencers played a crucial role in reviewing and
recommending products available on Temu. They shared their honest opinions and experiences
using products from various brands. Their reviews and recommendations helped build trust and
credibility among their followers, encouraging them to explore and purchase products through Temu.
Giveaways and Contests: Temu collaborated with influencers to host giveaways and contests,
where users had the chance to win exclusive prizes or discounts by engaging with the app or
participating in specific promotional activities. These initiatives created buzz, generated user
excitement, and attracted new users to the platform.
Affiliate Marketing: Temu employed affiliate marketing strategies with influencers, where
influencers received a commission or referral fee for every user who downloaded the app or made
a purchase through their unique referral links. This incentivized influencers to actively promote Temu
and its offerings, as their earnings were directly tied to the success of their referrals.
Event Participation: Temu partnered with influencers for events such as product launches, fashion
shows, or brand campaigns. Influencers attended these events, shared live updates, and provided
behind-the-scenes content to their followers, creating a sense of exclusivity and fostering excitement
around Temu's activities.
User-generated Content: Temu encouraged influencers and their followers to create usergenerated content related to the app. This could include unboxing videos, styling tips, or hauls
showcasing products purchased through Temu. Such content served as social proof and
encouraged other users to engage with the app and make purchases.
Overall, Temu's collaborations with influencers helped amplify its brand message, expand its reach
to new audiences, and establish credibility within the social media landscape. By leveraging the
influence and creative abilities of influencers, Temu successfully tapped into their followers' trust
and engagement, driving user acquisition, and fostering a positive brand image.
User Referral Program:
Temu has been incentivizing existing users to refer the app to their friends and family by offering
discounts or exclusive rewards. This word-of-mouth marketing approach contributed to the app's
exponential growth and user acquisition.
Targeted Digital Advertising:
Temu has been leveraging targeted digital advertising campaigns across various digital platforms
like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok and soon Telegram focusing on specific demographics
and user segments. By tailoring their messaging and creative assets, Temu effectively reached
potential users with personalized content.
Expansion into New Markets:
After gaining traction in its home market, Temu has been expanding its operations into international
markets. It strategically entered regions with high smartphone penetration and a growing ecommerce ecosystem. This expansion allowed Temu to tap into a larger customer base and
establish itself as a global player in the shopping app industry.
Partnerships with Brands and Retailers:
Recognizing the importance of strategic alliances, Temu has been forging partnerships with
renowned brands and retailers. These collaborations involved exclusive product launches, limitededition collections, and promotional campaigns. By aligning with established names in the retail
industry, Temu gained credibility and attracted a wider range of customers.
Continuous Innovation:
Temu has been prioritizing continuous innovation to stay ahead of the competition. It regularly
updated its app with new features and enhancements based on user feedback and emerging trends.
For example, it introduced a virtual stylist feature that offered personalized fashion advice and styling
tips, further enhancing the user experience.
Data-driven Insights:
Temu has been leveraging the vast amount of user data it collected to gain valuable insights into
consumer behavior, preferences, and trends. These insights were used to refine its product offering,
improve targeted advertising efforts, and optimize the overall shopping experience. By harnessing
the power of data, Temu was able to make data-informed decisions and stay attuned to evolving
customer needs.
Seamless Integration with Physical Stores:
Recognizing the importance of the omnichannel experience, Temu has been integrating its app
with physical stores. It introduced features like in-store barcode scanning, which allowed users to
access product information, read reviews, and make purchases directly from their smartphones
while inside partner retail locations. This integration blurred the lines between online and offline
shopping and provided a seamless and unified experience.
Social Impact Initiatives:
Temu also has also been focusing on social impact initiatives to connect with socially conscious
consumers. It launched sustainable product collections, partnered with NGOs for charitable causes,
and implemented eco-friendly packaging practices. These initiatives resonated with environmentally
and socially conscious users, further strengthening Temu's brand reputation and loyalty.
Continuous Customer Support:
Temu has been placing strong emphasis on customer support and responsiveness. It established
dedicated customer service channels, including live chat support and a comprehensive FAQ section.
Timely and effective customer support enhanced user satisfaction, resolved issues promptly, and
fostered a positive brand image.
A heavy paid media strategy:
Like other well-funded internet companies, Temu appears to be spending heavily for app installs
and on search ads. Search for almost any commodity product—especially if your search includes
the word “cheap”—and you’re likely to find a Google result for Temu. Temu also gained attention
with multiple Super Bowl spots, putting it on the map for many US consumers for the first time.
Results and Impacts
The rise of Temu as a shopping app has revolutionized the Retail Industry and also Consumer
Experience;
User Base and Revenue Growth:
Within two years of its launch, Temu has amassed millions of active users and experienced
exponential revenue growth. Its user-centric approach and innovative features resonated with
consumers, driving adoption and usage.
Enhanced Customer Experience:
Temu's focus on personalization, convenience, and seamless shopping experiences has elevated
customer satisfaction levels. Users appreciated the ability to try on products virtually, receive tailored
recommendations, and enjoy hassle-free transactions.
Disruption of Traditional Retail:
The Traditional Retail industry has suffered relatively as a result of the rise of Temu as a Shopping
App. It has greatly disrupted traditional brick-and-mortar retail, with many businesses. This is so
because with their new innovation, they have explored other parts(online) which the traditional
retailers do not have. Its rise has posed several challenges for traditional retailers as they struggle
to adapt to the changing landscape;
Online Presence and Digital Transformation: Traditional retailers are still struggling with
establishing a strong online presence and undergoing digital transformation. Building and
maintaining an effective e-commerce website or app requires technical expertise, investment in
infrastructure, and a shift in mindset. Adapting to the digital realm is now very challenging for retailers
who have primarily operated in brick-and-mortar stores.
Competition with E-commerce Giants: E-commerce platforms like Temu with significant
resources, a broad customer base, and strong brand recognition which makes it difficult for
Traditional retailers to compete with in terms of pricing, product selection, and customer
convenience. It can be challenging for them to match the speed, efficiency, and scale of operations
offered by online marketplaces.
Supply Chain and Logistics: Traditional retailers have gotten used to managing inventory primarily
for physical stores and now face challenges in adapting their supply chain and logistics operations
to accommodate online sales. Efficient inventory management, order fulfillment, and last-mile
delivery is quite complex and requires adjustments to meet the demands of e-commerce customers.
Customer Expectations and Experience: Online shoppers have come to expect a seamless and
personalized shopping experience. Traditional retailers now struggle to meet these expectations,
especially provided they have very limited experience in online customer engagement,
personalization, and tailoring recommendations. Adapting to a customer-centric approach and
providing a consistent omnichannel experience can be a significant challenge.
Data and Analytics: E-commerce platforms like Temu rely heavily on data and analytics to
understand customer behavior, preferences, and trends. Traditional retailers have limited
experience in collecting, analyzing, and utilizing customer data effectively. Harnessing data to make
data-driven decisions and optimize operations is now a significant hurdle for retailers transitioning
to an online model.
Operational Costs and Margins: Traditional retailers are facing financial challenges to adapt to ecommerce. Online operations require investments in technology, infrastructure, marketing, and
fulfillment capabilities. Retailers need to reevaluate their pricing strategies, optimize operational
costs, and find ways to maintain profitability in the face of increased competition and potentially
lower margins.
Brand Differentiation and Customer Loyalty: Building a strong brand and fostering customer
loyalty has proven to be more challenging in the online space. Traditional retailers may have
developed a loyal customer base through in-person interactions and personalized service.
Translating that loyalty to the digital realm and effectively differentiating their brand from competitors
needs innovative strategies and marketing efforts which will take time.
By leveraging technology and understanding evolving consumer behaviors, Temu has disrupted the
retail industry, reshaped shopping habits, and set new standards for convenience and engagement
in the digital age;
Temu’s Setbacks
Despite its rapid rise, its relationship with sister company Pinduoduo has brought about several
challenges in delivery of goods as compared to its competitors and other areas;
According to reports published in Times, Temu is beginning to develop a reputation for undelivered
packages, mysterious charges, incorrect orders and unresponsive customer service. Temu itself
acknowledges that its orders take longer to arrive than those from Amazon—typically 7-15 business
days as they come from “overseas warehouses.” In a series of Facebook messages with Times,
Roper Malloy, a client complained of spending $178 on gifts from Temu for her family, including two
drones and some makeup for her daughter which has never arrived. She said she has contacted
the company several times for a refund, which has also yet to arrive.
On May 17, 2023, Montana Governor Greg Gianforte banned Temu from statewide government
devices, as well as ByteDance apps (including TikTok ) , Telegram , and WeChat.
In June 2023, the U.S. House Select Committee on U.S.- Chinese Communist Party Strategic
Competition stated that Temu did not maintain ""even the facade of a meaningful compliance
program"" with the law. Uyghur on Forced Labor Prevention to keep goods made by forced labor off
its platform.
In October, the Boston branch of the Better Business Bureau opened up a file on Temu and has
received 31 complaints about the website. Temu currently has a C rating on the BBB, and an
average customer rating of 1.4 stars out of 5, although from only 20 reviews. (Complaints are
separate from reviews, which do not factor into BBB’s official rating.) McGovern at the BBB
mentioned that, it’s unusual for such a new company to receive so many complaints in such a short
amount of time. Temu has acknowledged and responded to every complaint posted to the BBB
website, but many of those complaints remain unresolved.
Temu’s sister company, Pinduoduo, has long been accused of hosting sales of counterfeits, illegal
goods, or products that do not match their descriptions. (Pinduoduo wrote in its SEC filings that it
immediately removes unauthorized products or misleading information on its platform, and freezes
the accounts of sellers on the site who violate its policies.)
There have been no BBB complaints that allege the goods Temu ships are counterfeit or fake.
Additionally, in 2021, the deaths of two Pinduoduo employees spurred investigations and boycotts
over the company’s working conditions, according to the New York Times.
How Temu could affect the U.S. economy
In May 2023, the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission raised concerns about
risks to users' personal data on Temu as a shopping app affiliated with Pinduoduo, which was
removed from Google Play after some of its versions were found to contain malware. Schmidt, at
Vanderbilt, who specializes in security and privacy, is of the opinion that Temu’s data and privacy
practices aren’t out of the ordinary; The company collects lots of personal data about users and then
deploys that data to sell ads. However, he says that Temu’s rise could have a bigger impact not in
terms of privacy concerns, but in terms of pressure on American companies and workers. If more
and more American consumers flock to Temu to buy cut-rate goods, that could pressure Amazon
and other competitors to slash their prices too which would affect wages.
Areas for Improvements
Despite its innovative business model and commitment to sustainability, Temu still has some areas
that need improvement;
Real-Time Shopping: Cost-Effectiveness vs. Plagiarism and Exploitation:
Temu’s most innovative and effective strategy has been highly ambivalent and criticized. Similar to
SHEIN, Temu has been using a reverse-manufacturing model that relays customer feedback directly
to manufacturers. Starting off with smaller quantities that are offered on the marketplace, products
in high demand are reordered, while others are replaced. According to Temu, this results in
environmental efficiency because product inventory is aligned with customer demand in real time.
In addition, a greater number of products can be offered than with traditional retail strategies. With
this method, SHEIN was able to launch 150,000 new items in 2020, beating its competitors by a
wide margin.
Temu Has to Fight Criticism:
Critics point to several detrimental effects of this type of 'ultra-fast' commerce: To ensure low prices,
manufacturers must keep costs down, contributing to the continued poverty of workers in
manufacturing countries. The same goes for product quality and environmental friendliness: Cheap
products that break easily contribute to increasing amounts of waste, returned products tend to be
dumped rather than recycled or resold, and the high number of new products sold is only possible
by ripping off SME fashion designers and creators.
TrustPilot reviews reveal a 2.9-star average, with the majority of one-star reviews citing long shipping
times, low-quality items, and poor customer service. Low quality items can become a sustainability
issue in itself, since those products have a higher chance of ending up in landfill. It’s essential for
Temu to address these concerns and maintain a balance between low prices and customer
satisfaction.
Lessons Learned
Temu's rise as a shopping app exemplifies the transformative power of technology in the retail
industry. Its success serves as an inspiration for other businesses seeking to adapt and thrive in the
digital era. Overall, the rise of Temu as a shopping app has been driven by its commitment to
innovation, personalized experiences, strategic partnerships, and a customer-centric approach. The
marketplace Temu has achieved impressive success with its business model of offering low-priced
products and free shipping, combined with a gamified shopping experience. Temu's strategy also
includes group buying, referrals, affiliate programs, and heavy advertising on social media platforms.
While Temu's real-time shopping model, which involves relaying customer feedback directly to
manufacturers, is seen as innovative and cost-effective, it has also garnered criticism. Critics argue
that this approach can lead to environmental issues, exploitation of workers, and plagiarism of
designs from small and medium-sized fashion creators. Despite these concerns, Temu's
combination of low prices, gamified shopping, and heavy advertising on platforms like TikTok and
YouTube has made it a major player in the ultra-fast eCommerce sector.
However, Temu's most controversial strategy is its real-time shopping model akin to that of SHEIN,
which relays customer feedback directly to manufacturers. While this model increases costeffectiveness and product variety, critics argue that it contributes to environmental degradation,
exploitation of workers, and plagiarism of fashion designers.
Nonetheless, Temu's growth and distinct strategy make it a noteworthy player in this emerging
business model of ultra-fast eCommerce, and it will be interesting to see how this trend plays out in
the future.

Industry

online customers, and compete effectively in the digital marketplace. It's important to continuously
evaluate and refine your online presence based on customer feedback, market trends, and
emerging technologies to stay ahead of the competition.
Future Outlook
The rise of Temu as a shopping app has been remarkable, and it has successfully disrupted the
retail experience by implementing innovative strategies and business models. Looking ahead, there
are several key factors that will shape the future outlook of Temu and determine its continued
success in the competitive online shopping market;
Expansion into New Markets: Temu has already expanded its operations to several countries,
including the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain,
and the United Kingdom. To sustain its growth, Temu will likely continue to explore opportunities for
expansion into new markets, both within and outside of these regions. This expansion will allow the
platform to reach a larger customer base and tap into new consumer preferences and demands.
Improvement in Delivery Times: One area of concern for customers is the longer delivery times
associated with Temu's Next-Gen Manufacturing (NGM) model. To address this issue, Temu may
invest in optimizing its supply chain and logistics processes. By streamlining operations and
partnering with efficient shipping providers, Temu can reduce delivery times and enhance the overall
customer experience.
Enhanced Customer Engagement: Temu's success is partly attributed to its gamification
strategies and social commerce approach. To maintain customer engagement and loyalty, Temu
will need to continuously innovate and introduce new features that incentivize users to stay active
on the platform. This could include personalized recommendations, rewards programs, and
interactive shopping experiences.
Sustainability and Social Responsibility: Temu has positioned itself as a platform that promotes
sustainability and social responsibility through its NGM model, which reduces unsold inventory and
waste. Going forward, it will be crucial for Temu to uphold these values and communicate its
commitment to sustainability to customers. This can be achieved through transparent supply chain
practices, eco-friendly packaging options, and partnerships with ethical suppliers.
Competition and Differentiation: While Temu has gained significant traction, it faces strong
competition from other Chinese online wholesale platforms and established e-commerce giants. To
stay ahead, Temu will need to continue differentiating itself through its NGM model, competitive
pricing, and unique product offerings. It should also focus on building a strong brand identity and
nurturing customer trust through excellent customer service and reliable purchase protection.
navigate the competitive landscape. With its innovative approach and commitment to customer
satisfaction, Temu has the potential to continue reshaping the online
Conclusion
Conclusively, Temu has emerged as a shopping app that is revolutionizing the retail experience
through its Next-Gen Manufacturing model and direct-to-supplier approach. By focusing on cost
savings, customization, and sustainability, Temu has gained a competitive edge in the market. With
a lot of consumer goods being produced in China it makes sense that more and more e-commerce
platforms are Chinese. The success of Temu and its competitors showcases the power of
connecting customers directly with suppliers, ultimately reshaping the way people shop online.
TEMU's emergence in the e-commerce landscape with its lightning-fast shipping times has
undoubtedly stirred the industry. By setting new standards for efficiency and customer satisfaction,
TEMU challenges traditional platforms to step up their game. While the convenience of rapid
shipping is undeniable, the long-term sustainability and overall impact of this approach must also be
considered. As consumers continue to prioritize convenience and speed, the success of TEMU may
very well influence how the e-commerce ecosystem evolves in the years to come. However, to
sustain its growth and success, Temu must adapt to evolving customer preferences, optimize its
operations, and effectively.","Several factors contributed to Temu's success.  Its core strategy revolves around low prices achieved through its Next-Gen Manufacturing (NGM) model, which connects customers directly with suppliers, minimizing warehousing and transportation costs.  This allows Temu to offer near-wholesale prices by accurately forecasting sales and demand.  Temu also differentiates itself through gamification, incorporating games and rewards to increase user engagement and time spent on the app.  A robust referral program, coupled with heavy advertising on social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube, further expands its reach and attracts new customers.  Additionally, leveraging mobile technology, personalized recommendations, and seamless checkout and delivery contribute to a positive user experience.  Temu's claim of sustainability through its NGM model also resonates with environmentally conscious consumers.

Also, summarize her concerns about the changes that she is witnessing while working in Emergency Medicine.","Thank you, Senator Markey and Senator Warren for having me this morning.
 My name is Ellana Stinson. I am a board-certified emergency medicine physician and have
 practiced emergency medicine for 15 years.
 From 2013 to 2020, I worked on staff as an emergency medicine physician at Carney Hospital,
 Good Samaritan and the former Quincy Hospital, all part of the Steward Health System. In
 addition, over the past 11 years, I have worked intermittently throughout the country at various
 facilities run and operated by HCA, Envision, Tenant, Team Health and CHS.
 When I entered medicine, I deeply loved what I did. Caring for patients in their most vulnerable
 moments and working in beautifully orchestrated chaos while bearing witness to so many life
 changing moments filled me with pride at the end of each shift. Unfortunately, so much of what
 I loved about Emergency Medicine has changed drastically over the years.
 Initially, my time at Carney felt very fresh and fulfilling. Being able to serve a very diverse
 population in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston was essentially how I always imagined my
 career trajectory, serving the most vulnerable populations. But when I could no longer care for
 my patients the way I would want a loved one treated, I had to make decisions to stay or
 go. Having spent time at several other Stewart facilities briefly, I began to realize how resources
 were being dwindled down and pulled from each facility. Most of the facilities no longer had
 certain speciality services and Quincy Hospital, eventually was taken down to bare bones before
 its ultimate closure. Not having blood products, respiratory therapy at times or certain specialty
 services no longer felt like I was able to provide safe or quality care. What is happening here in
 the Commonwealth is happening around the country.
 We have now seen the buyouts, mergers and acquisitions led by private equity firms of over 30%
 of hospitals in the US. Having spent time at other PE sites around the country the level of
 deprivation was seemingly worse in some areas. Increased wait times and critical shortage of
 staff leading to dangerous boarding levels and critically dangerous patient to nurse ratios in the
 emergency department, seeing upwards to 14 to 1 ratios at times. All of this only to be
 exacerbated by the pandemic which resulted in increased cost of care, infection rates, mortality
 and even death.
 Practicing medicine in many PE led places is no longer about patient safety and quality, but
 about making medical decisions and judgment due corporate decision making with profit
 motives at the expense of patients. Forcing staff to see patients in the waiting room in order to
 have it appear wait times were being reduced and improving door to doc times, calling codes for
 sepsis and strokes in order to find innovative ways to make profits. Increasingly daunting
 metrics required of physicians and other staff to meet were nearly unattainable and unsafe in
 many instances, but very much expected. In addition, many sites across the country began to
 remove emergency physicians from in-network, resulting in higher bills for patients known as
 surprise billing. These profit gaining practices not only harm patients but also increase financial
 burdens on patients who do not have a choice of where they will go when they are experiencing
 crushing chest pain or stroke-like symptoms. Especially when the next closest facility has been
 in some of my experiences, upwards to an hour away. 
 Most of the facilities I worked in were in very vulnerable populations that were mostly people of
 color, low income, or had limited access to other facilities or primary care services. Forcing
 them to only seek their care at a PE backed site. It is also known that most of the buyouts are of
 hospitals and facilities already struggling or with higher Medicaid and Medicare populations
 which ultimately affects our most vulnerable populations. It is critical we consider not only the
 impact these facilities have on our health care system, but also on the worsening care access and
 quality being provided to those communities already harmed by historical injury. The
 financialization of medicine will continue to exacerbate health disparities despite work being
 done on the ground to close these gaps.
 In addition, these Private Equity backed facilities are where I typically run into other emergency
 physicians of color. As it pertains to myself and my colleagues, these practices often felt unsafe,
 which sparked many questions of medical legal risk as well as the emotional toll it takes on all of
 us who enter this profession to do no harm. In addition, being on staff at a PE backed facility
 also would not qualify physicians swimming in student debt for loan forgiveness. A profession
 once competitive when I first began my medical journey is now one of the least competitive
 fields to enter as students bear witness to the destruction of the profession. In 2023, 554 of the
 residency spots went unfilled. We also saw more PE backed hospitals opening residency
 programs that were not adequately equipped to provide the proper training for an emergency
 medicine trainee.
 We train to deal with hard stuff, but we are running out of options on how to continue providing safe and adequate care at these PE run facilities.","Ellana Stinson is a board-certified emergency medicine physician with 15 years of experience. From 2013-2020, she worked at Carney Hospital, Good Samaritan, and Quincy Hospital (all part of Steward Health System).  Over 11 years, she also worked intermittently at various facilities run by HCA, Envision, Tenant, Team Health, and CHS.  She initially found her work fulfilling, particularly serving a diverse population at Carney Hospital in Dorchester.

Her primary concern is the detrimental impact of private equity firms on healthcare.  She has witnessed the ""buyouts, mergers and acquisitions"" of hospitals, leading to resource depletion, staff shortages, dangerous patient-to-nurse ratios, and increased wait times. These practices, she argues, prioritize profit over patient safety and quality care.  She cites examples such as forcing staff to see patients in waiting rooms to manipulate wait time metrics, and ""calling codes"" for sepsis and strokes to increase profits.  Further, she is concerned about the removal of emergency physicians from in-network insurance coverage (surprise billing),  the closure of specialty services, and the disproportionate targeting of struggling hospitals serving vulnerable, low-income, and minority populations. She notes the difficulty of providing quality care in facilities lacking essential resources, even basic supplies like blood products. Ellana also observes that these private equity-backed facilities often employ physicians of color and do not qualify for student loan forgiveness programs,  deterring new doctors from entering the field.  She states the number of unfilled residency spots in 2023 and the emergence of inadequately equipped PE-backed residency programs highlight the declining state of the profession.

Ellana highlights issues like increased wait times, critical staff shortages, unsafe patient-to-nurse ratios, and profit-driven medical decision-making. She is particularly troubled by practices like surprise billing, forced patient care in waiting rooms to manipulate wait time metrics, and the risks these pose to both patients and healthcare professionals. Additionally, she mentions how these changes disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, including people of color and low-income communities, by decreasing access to quality healthcare. Ellana is also concerned about the impact on medical professionals, highlighting how these practices can increase medical legal risks and strain mental health, as well as the challenges faced by new trainees in inadequately equipped residency programs.","Based on the text, here is Ellana Stinson's background and concerns:

 [context document]","What is the technical difference between a VPN and an Extranet, and how do both get utilized safely in an enterprise environment without breaking connections between computers?","2.3 VPNs and Extranets
 

  The term 'extranet' is commonly used to refer to a scenario whereby
  two or more companies have networked access to a limited amount of
  each other's corporate data. For example a manufacturing company
  might use an extranet for its suppliers to allow it to query
  databases for the pricing and availability of components, and then to
  order and track the status of outstanding orders. Another example is
  joint software development, for instance, company A allows one
  development group within company B to access its operating system
  source code, and company B allows one development group in company A
  to access its security software. Note that the access policies can
  get arbitrarily complex. For example company B may internally
  restrict access to its security software to groups in certain
  geographic locations to comply with export control laws, for example.
 

  A key feature of an extranet is thus the control of who can access
  what data, and this is essentially a policy decision. Policy
  decisions are typically enforced today at the interconnection points
  between different domains, for example between a private network and
  the Internet, or between a software test lab and the rest of the
  company network. The enforcement may be done via a firewall, router
  with access list functionality, application gateway, or any similar
  device capable of applying policy to transit traffic. Policy
  controls may be implemented within a corporate network, in addition
  to between corporate networks. Also the interconnections between
  networks could be a set of bilateral links, or could be a separate
  network, perhaps maintained by an industry consortium. This separate
  network could itself be a VPN or a physical network.
 

  Introducing VPNs into a network does not require any change to this
  model. Policy can be enforced between two VPNs, or between a VPN and
  the Internet, in exactly the same manner as is done today without
  VPNs. For example two VPNs could be interconnected, which each
  administration locally imposing its own policy controls, via a
  firewall, on all traffic that enters its VPN from the outside,
  whether from another VPN or from the Internet.
 

  This model of a VPN provides for a separation of policy from the
  underlying mode of packet transport used. For example, a router may
  direct voice traffic to ATM Virtual Channel Connections (VCCs) for
  guaranteed QoS, non-local internal company traffic to secure tunnels,
  and other traffic to a link to the Internet. In the past the secure
  tunnels may have been frame relay circuits, now they may also be
  secure IP tunnels or MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)
 

 

 

 

 

 

 Gleeson, et al. Informational [Page 9]
 

 RFC 2764  IP Based Virtual Private Networks  February 2000
 

 

  Other models of a VPN are also possible. For example there is a
  model whereby a set of application flows is mapped into a VPN. As
  the policy rules imposed by a network administrator can get quite
  complex, the number of distinct sets of application flows that are
  used in the policy rulebase, and hence the number of VPNs, can thus
  grow quite large, and there can be multiple overlapping VPNs.
  However there is little to be gained by introducing such new
  complexity into a network. Instead a VPN should be viewed as a
  direct analogue to a physical network, as this allows the leveraging
  of existing protocols and procedures, and the current expertise and
  skill sets of network administrators and customers.","The technical difference between a VPN and an extranet lies in their primary function:  An **extranet** focuses on controlled *access* to resources between different organizations, while a **VPN** focuses on secure *transport* of data, regardless of the access policies in place. An extranet defines *who* can access *what*, while a VPN provides the secure *connection* over which that access occurs.  Extranets establish policy decisions, while VPNs provide the secure infrastructure.


Safe utilization in an enterprise environment involves using both technologies in conjunction:


1. **Extranet Access Control:** Implement firewalls, routers with access lists, or application gateways at interconnection points.  This controls which external entities (partners, suppliers, etc.) can access specific parts of the internal network.  This access can be granular, controlling access to specific databases or code repositories, as illustrated by the examples provided.

2. **VPN for Secure Transport:**  Wrap the extranet connections within VPN tunnels. This secures the communication channel between the organizations, regardless of the underlying network infrastructure (Internet, dedicated lines, etc.).  The VPN doesn't change the extranet's access policies but ensures the data exchanged remains confidential and protected from tampering.


By combining these approaches, companies can provide secure, controlled access to their resources without disrupting internal connections. The VPN acts as a secure overlay, independent of the access control mechanisms of the extranet. The text specifically states that introducing VPNs doesn't change the existing extranet model and that policy enforcement can happen between VPNs or between a VPN and the internet, just as it would without VPNs. This separation of policy (extranet) and transport (VPN) allows for flexible and secure inter-organizational communication.
","The technical difference between a VPN and an Extranet primarily lies in their intended use and the nature of their access controls. An extranet is used to provide controlled networked access to certain corporate data between two or more companies. It is utilized to allow external partners, such as suppliers or development teams, to access specific, limited resources of a company's network under strict policy controls. These controls are typically enforced at network interconnection points using devices like firewalls, routers with access list functionality, or application gateways.

On the other hand, a VPN (Virtual Private Network) focuses on providing secure communication over a public network, like the internet. VPNs create secure tunnels or connections that ensure data privacy and integrity during transit. The concept of VPNs allows for separating policy decisions from the method of packet transport, often utilizing secure IP tunnels or MPLS label-switched paths for secure communications. 

In an enterprise environment, both VPNs and extranets are utilized safely by maintaining stringent policy enforcement at critical interconnection points. For VPNs, this involves administering localized control, such as firewall policies, to regulate traffic entry from external sources, ensuring secure communication without compromising network integrity. Similarly, extranets rely on enforcing access policies to ensure that only authorized external entities can access specified corporate data. This structured approach allows both VPNs and extranets to function without breaking connections between computers, preserving seamless interconnectivity and data security.","Based on the provided text, here are the key technical differences between VPNs and Extranets, and how they are utilized safely:

Technical Differences:
- An Extranet is specifically focused on allowing two or more companies to have networked access to a limited amount of each other's corporate data
- A VPN functions more like a direct analogue to a physical network, focusing on the mode of packet transport

Safe Enterprise Utilization:
1. Policy Enforcement:
- Both VPNs and Extranets can be protected through policy controls at interconnection points
- These policies are enforced using:
  * Firewalls
  * Routers with access list functionality
  * Application gateways
  * Similar devices capable of applying policy to transit traffic

2. Integration:
- VPNs can be introduced without changing the existing security model
- Two VPNs can be interconnected with each administration imposing its own policy controls
- Policy can be enforced between VPNs or between a VPN and the Internet in the same way as traditional networks

3. Flexibility:
- The underlying transport can be varied while maintaining security:
  * Voice traffic can be directed to ATM Virtual Channel Connections
  * Non-local internal company traffic to secure tunnels
  * Other traffic to Internet links
  * Secure IP tunnels or MPLS Label Switched Paths can be used

The text emphasizes that both technologies can coexist and maintain connections by properly implementing policy controls at network boundaries while allowing necessary traffic flow based on defined security rules.",1916,1681,1557,1718.0

You may use bulleted lists for organizing your response, but avoid all other markdown formatting.",Discuss the differing perspectives on whether or not the output of AI models should be afforded copyright protection.,"Do AI Outputs Enjoy Copyright Protection?
The question of whether or not copyright protection may be afforded to AI outputs—such as images
created by DALL-E or texts created by ChatGPT—likely hinges at least partly on the concept of
“authorship.” The U.S. Constitution authorizes Congress to “secur[e] for limited Times to Authors . . . the
exclusive Right to their . . . Writings.” Based on this authority, the Copyright Act affords copyright
protection to “original works of authorship.” Although the Constitution and Copyright Act do not
explicitly define who (or what) may be an “author,” the U.S. Copyright Office recognizes copyright only
in works “created by a human being.” Courts have likewise declined to extend copyright protection to
nonhuman authors, holding that a monkey who took a series of photos lacked standing to sue under the
Copyright Act; that some human creativity was required to copyright a book purportedly inspired by
celestial beings; and that a living garden could not be copyrighted as it lacked a human author.

A recent lawsuit challenged the human-authorship requirement in the context of works purportedly
“authored” by AI. In June 2022, Stephen Thaler sued the Copyright Office for denying his application to
register a visual artwork that he claims was authored “autonomously” by an AI program called the
Creativity Machine. Dr. Thaler argued that human authorship is not required by the Copyright Act. On
August 18, 2023, a federal district court granted summary judgment in favor of the Copyright Office. The
court held that “human authorship is an essential part of a valid copyright claim,” reasoning that only
human authors need copyright as an incentive to create works. Dr. Thaler has stated that he plans to
appeal the decision.

Assuming that a copyrightable work requires a human author, works created by humans using generative
AI could still be entitled to copyright protection, depending on the nature of human involvement in the
creative process. However, a recent copyright proceeding and subsequent Copyright Registration
Guidance indicate that the Copyright Office is unlikely to find the requisite human authorship where an
AI program generates works in response to text prompts. In September 2022, Kris Kashtanova registered
a copyright for a graphic novel illustrated with images that Midjourney generated in response to text
inputs. In October 2022, the Copyright Office initiated cancellation proceedings, noting that Kashtanova
had not disclosed the use of AI. Kashtanova responded by arguing that the images were made via “a
creative, iterative process.” On February 21, 2023, the Copyright Office determined that the images were
not copyrightable, deciding that Midjourney, rather than Kashtanova, authored the “visual material.” In
March 2023, the Copyright Office released guidance stating that, when AI “determines the expressive
elements of its output, the generated material is not the product of human authorship.”

Some commentators assert that some AI-generated works should receive copyright protection, arguing
that AI programs are like other tools that human beings have used to create copyrighted works. For
example, the Supreme Court has held since the 1884 case Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony that
photographs can be entitled to copyright protection where the photographer makes decisions regarding
creative elements such as composition, arrangement, and lighting. Generative AI programs might be seen
as a new tool analogous to the camera, as Kashtanova argued.

Other commentators and the Copyright Office dispute the photography analogy and question whether AI
users exercise sufficient creative control for AI to be considered merely a tool. In Kashtanova’s case, the
Copyright Office reasoned that Midjourney was not “a tool that [] Kashtanova controlled and guided to
reach [their] desired image” because it “generates images in an unpredictable way.” The Copyright Office
instead compared the AI user to “a client who hires an artist” and gives that artist only “general
directions.” The office’s March 2023 guidance similarly claims that “users do not exercise ultimate
creative control over how [generative AI] systems interpret prompts and generate materials.” One of
Kashtanova’s lawyers, on the other hand, argues that the Copyright Act does not require such exacting
creative control, noting that certain photographs and modern art incorporate a degree of happenstance.
Some commentators argue that the Copyright Act’s distinction between copyrightable “works” and
noncopyrightable “ideas” supplies another reason that copyright should not protect AI-generated works.
One law professor has suggested that the human user who enters a text prompt into an AI program—for
instance, asking DALL-E “to produce a painting of hedgehogs having a tea party on the beach”—has
“contributed nothing more than an idea” to the finished work. According to this argument, the output
image lacks a human author and cannot be copyrighted.

While the Copyright Office’s actions indicate that it may be challenging to obtain copyright protection for
AI-generated works, the issue remains unsettled. Applicants may file suit in U.S. district court to
challenge the Copyright Office’s final decisions to refuse to register a copyright (as Dr. Thaler did), and it
remains to be seen whether federal courts will agree with all of the office’s decisions. While the
Copyright Office notes that courts sometimes give weight to the office’s experience and expertise in this
field, courts will not necessarily adopt the office’s interpretations of the Copyright Act.

In addition, the Copyright Office’s guidance accepts that works “containing” AI-generated material may
be copyrighted under some circumstances, such as “sufficiently creative” human arrangements or
modifications of AI-generated material or works that combine AI-generated and human-authored material.
The office states that the author may only claim copyright protection “for their own contributions” to such
works, and they must identify and disclaim AI-generated parts of the work if they apply to register their
copyright. In September 2023, for instance, the Copyright Office Review Board affirmed the office’s
refusal to register a copyright for an artwork that was generated by Midjourney and then modified in
various ways by the applicant, since the applicant did not disclaim the AI-generated material.","*   The U.S. Copyright Office and some courts maintain that copyright protection requires human authorship, citing the U.S. Constitution and Copyright Act.  This stance has led to denials of copyright for AI-generated works.

*   Some argue against the human authorship requirement, suggesting AI programs are tools akin to cameras, and that users' creative input in prompting the AI should suffice for copyright eligibility.

*   The Copyright Office disputes the comparison of AI to tools like cameras, arguing AI users lack sufficient creative control over the output. They liken the user to a client giving general directions to an artist.

*   Some contend that AI-generated works represent the output of user-provided ideas, not original works of authorship, and therefore should not be copyrightable.

*   The Copyright Office's stance, while influential, is not legally binding, and court challenges (like Stephen Thaler's lawsuit) are ongoing.

*   The Copyright Office acknowledges that works incorporating AI-generated content may be copyrightable if there's substantial human modification or combination with human-authored elements. However, applicants must clearly identify and disclaim AI-generated portions.  The office refused to register a copyright for a Midjourney-generated and later modified artwork due to the applicant's failure to disclaim the AI contribution.
","The perspectives on whether AI outputs should receive copyright protection are varied and continue to be debated:

- **Human Authorship Requirement**: The U.S. Copyright Office and courts have traditionally required human authorship for copyright protection. AI-generated works have been denied copyright because they lack a human author. Stephen Thaler's lawsuit challenging this requirement was rejected, with the court emphasizing that copyright serves as an incentive for human creators.

- **Generative AI as a Tool**: Some argue that AI programs can be seen as tools, similar to cameras, which aid human creativity. This perspective suggests works created using AI might deserve copyright if human involvement is significant. The decision in the Kris Kashtanova case, however, contradicted this view, as the Copyright Office determined that the AI was the author of the visual material.

- **Limits to Human Creative Control**: Critics, including the Copyright Office, question whether AI users exert enough creative control over outputs. AI-generated works are seen as unpredictable, with users likened to clients providing general guidance rather than taking an active role in the creative process. Some argue that human input in AI, like text prompts, contributes only ideas, not tangible creative expressions required for copyright.

- **Differentiating Works and Ideas**: There's an argument that entering a prompt into an AI serves merely as an idea, distancing it from the copyrightable ""works"" needed under the law.

- **Challenges to Copyright Office Decisions**: The matter of AI copyright remains unresolved, with future court cases possibly challenging the Copyright Office's decisions.

- **Hybrid Works**: The Copyright Office allows for the possibility of copyrighting works containing AI material if human contributions are evident and significant. However, AI-generated parts must be disclaimed if applying for copyright, as demonstrated in a denial case in September 2023.

These points underline ongoing tensions and the complexities surrounding AI-generated works and copyright protection, with principles like human authorship and the role of AI as a tool central to the debate.","Based on the provided context, here are the differing perspectives on whether AI model outputs should receive copyright protection:

Arguments in favor of copyright protection:
• AI programs should be viewed as tools similar to other creative tools (like cameras) that humans use to create copyrighted works
• The Supreme Court's 1884 Burrow-Giles case established that photographs can receive copyright protection when photographers make creative decisions
• Some argue that the Copyright Act doesn't require the level of creative control that the Copyright Office demands

Arguments against copyright protection:
• The U.S. Copyright Office only recognizes copyright in works ""created by a human being""
• Courts have consistently declined to extend copyright protection to non-human authors
• The Copyright Office views AI systems as generating works unpredictably, rather than as tools controlled by users
• Some argue that providing text prompts to AI represents only an ""idea"" rather than copyrightable work
• The Copyright Office maintains that when AI determines expressive elements, the output lacks human authorship

Current official position:
• The Copyright Office generally will not copyright AI-generated works created purely from text prompts
• Works containing AI-generated material may be copyrightable if they include:
  - Sufficiently creative human arrangements
  - Human modifications of AI-generated material
  - Combinations of AI-generated and human-authored content
• Authors must identify and disclaim AI-generated portions when registering copyright
• The issue remains legally unsettled, as courts may not necessarily adopt the Copyright Office's interpretations",1386,2205,1689,1760.0

Paul Tonko and Sen. Richard Blumenthal announced details of their new Supporting Affordability and Fairness with Every Bet (SAFE) Bet Act during a press conference on Thursday.
 

 Bill would create federal oversight of state-run sports betting
 The overarching idea of the bill is to let states continue to regulate and oversee sports betting but to implement a set of federal minimum standards that state regulators and operators need to meet. States would be required to apply to the Department of Justice in order to get the greenlight to run a regulated market.
 

 Those federal standards cover a wide range of topics related to responsible and problem gambling. Unlike Tonko’s previous bill, the Betting on Our Future Act, which sought to ban all electronic advertising of sports betting, this version would allow it, but with several limitations.
 

 The bill would prohibit advertising during primetime hours as well as during live sporting events, implement language restrictions on words like “bonus”, “odds boost” and “no-sweat”, prohibit education about how to bet within the advertising and limit celebrity spokespeople from offering suggested bets to users.
 

 Bill would introduce affordability checks, limit ads, prohibit AI
 The legislation also takes a nod from other markets like the U.K. and includes what would be the first mandated affordability checks for sports bettors in the regulated U.S. market.
 

 Bettors would not be able to deposit via credit card, they would be limited to five deposits a day and operators would need to run affordability checks on bettors wagering at least $1,000 in a one-day period or $10,000 in a 30-day period. Bettors whose wagering exceeds more than 30% of their income would not be approved to bet.
 

 The bill would greenlight several reports, including from the Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), the Surgeon General’s office and the Center for Disease Control and would also introduce a national self-exclusion list.
 

 Finally, the bill would take proactive steps to limit the use of AI by sportsbook operators to track bettor behavior, create personalized betting offers or to generate gambling products like microbes.
 

 In-game betting was a major focus of the press conference, with lawmakers and representatives from the National Public Health Institute suggesting that the proliferation of in-game and microbetting was not what the government anticipated when the Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA).
 

 They did not call out DraftKings by name but specifically mentioned DraftKings’s acquisition of Simplebet as an indicator of what they feel is a problem.
 

 While Blumenthal also introduced the Gambling Addiction Recovery, Investment and Treatment (GRIT) Act at the start of the year, which would allocate the funds collected on the federal excise tax on sports betting and use them to fund problem gambling initiatives, the subject of funding did not come up during Thursday’s press event.
 

 Based on the limited information around the bill, it seems to only apply to sports betting and would not impact other forms of gambling such as casinos, online casinos or the lottery.
 

 Trade orgs quick to speak out against SAFE Bet Act
 Trade groups within the industry were quick to respond to the press conference expressing concerns about the proposed legislation.
 

 “Today’s regulated sports wagering operators are contributing billions in state taxes across the U.S., protecting consumers from dangerous neighborhood bookies and illegal offshore websites, and working diligently with over 5,000 state and tribal regulators and other stakeholders to ensure a commitment to responsibility and positive play. Six years into legal sports betting, introducing heavy-handed federal prohibitions is a slap in the face to state legislatures and gaming regulators who have dedicated countless time and resources to developing thoughtful frameworks unique to their jurisdictions, and have continued to iterate as their marketplaces evolve,” said American Gaming Associaton Senior Vice President of Government Relations Chris Cylke.
 

 iDEA Growth issued a statement on the measure as well, saying, in part:
 

 “iDEA remains committed to working with lawmakers, regulators, and stakeholders to enhance player protections in a way that empowers states and preserves the benefits of a well-regulated, competitive market. We urge Congress to reject this misguided federal mandate and instead support state-based solutions that are already working across the country.
 

 The SAFE Bet Act’s blanket, one-size-fits-all requirements on advertising, affordability checks, and artificial intelligence stifle the autonomy of states and tribal governments, many of which have implemented their own robust regulatory frameworks tailored to the needs of their constituents. These measures not only infringe on states’ rights but also risk undermining the operational flexibility that has allowed the legal sports betting industry to thrive, create jobs, and generate critical tax revenue that supports education, infrastructure, and other vital services.”
 

 Since the repeal of PASPA, several federal bills have been introduced regarding sports wagering, but none have made much progress or even advanced out of committee.","The Supporting Affordability and Fairness with Every Bet (SAFE) Bet Act, introduced by Rep. Paul Tonko and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, proposes federal oversight of state-run sports betting while allowing states to maintain regulatory control.  The bill aims to establish minimum federal standards that states and operators must meet, requiring states to apply to the Department of Justice for approval to operate a regulated market.

Focusing heavily on responsible and problem gambling, the SAFE Bet Act proposes several key changes. While permitting advertising, unlike a previous bill, it restricts ads during primetime and live sporting events, limits the use of certain promotional terms like ""bonus"" or ""no-sweat,"" prohibits betting education within ads, and restricts celebrity endorsements suggesting specific bets.

The bill introduces affordability checks, modeled after other markets like the U.K.  These checks include prohibiting credit card deposits, limiting daily deposits to five, and mandating affordability checks for bettors wagering $1,000 in a day or $10,000 in 30 days.  Bettors exceeding 30% of their income on wagers would be restricted.

Further provisions include commissioning reports from organizations like SAMHSA, the Surgeon General, and the CDC, establishing a national self-exclusion list, and proactively limiting the use of AI by sportsbooks to track bettor behavior or generate personalized offers. The bill specifically targets in-game and microbetting practices, which lawmakers feel have proliferated beyond what was envisioned after the repeal of PASPA.

It's important to note that the SAFE Bet Act appears to apply only to sports betting, excluding other gambling forms like casinos, online casinos, and lotteries.  Industry trade organizations have expressed concerns, arguing the bill undermines state regulatory authority and disregards existing responsible gambling frameworks already in place.  They believe the federal intervention is unnecessary and potentially harmful to the regulated market.  Historically, federal sports betting bills have struggled to gain traction, and it remains to be seen whether this one will be different.
","The SAFE Bet Act, proposed by Rep. Paul Tonko and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, aims to impose federal oversight on state-regulated sports betting, ensuring a standard level of responsible gambling practices across the United States. While allowing states to continue managing sports betting, the bill requires them to meet federal minimum standards and apply for approval from the Department of Justice to operate legally.

Key components of the Act include restrictions on advertising and the implementation of affordability checks for bettors. Specifically, it limits advertising during primetime and live sports events, bans certain promotional language, restricts the use of celebrity endorsements in betting ads, and prohibits teaching betting tactics through advertising.

Regarding financial measures, the Act prevents bettors from using credit cards for deposits, limits deposits to five per day, and mandates affordability checks for those placing large bets. Bettors whose wagers exceed 30% of their income would not be authorized to place bets. The Act also seeks to limit the use of AI by sportsbooks for tracking and targeting customers with personalized offers or products.

Additionally, it would introduce a national self-exclusion list and involve various health and public service organizations in generating reports related to problem gambling. Despite intentions to enhance consumer protection, the proposal faces opposition from industry groups who argue it undermines state rights and the current regulatory frameworks, which they believe are effective and contribute significant tax revenue and jobs. It only applies to sports betting, leaving other types of gambling untouched.","Based on the provided text, the SAFE Bet Act (Supporting Affordability and Fairness with Every Bet Act) is a proposed federal legislation introduced by Rep. Paul Tonko and Sen. Richard Blumenthal that aims to establish federal oversight of state-run sports betting operations.

The key proposals of the SAFE Bet Act include:

3.2.1 Objective of Article 3
An important objective of the Regulations in Article 3 is to enable cars to race closely, by
ensuring that the aerodynamic performance loss of a car following another car is kept to a
minimum. In order to verify whether this objective has been achieved, Competitors may be
required on request to supply the FIA with any relevant information.
2024 Formula 1 Technical Regulations 13 25 April 2023
© 2023 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile Issue 1
In any case the Intellectual Property of this information, will remain the property of the
Competitor, will be protected and not divulged to any third party.
3.2.2 Aerodynamic Influence
With the exception of the driver adjustable bodywork described in Article 3.10.10 (in addition
to minimal parts solely associated with its actuation) and the flexible seals specifically
permitted by Articles 3.13 and 3.14.4, all aerodynamic components or bodywork influencing
the car’s aerodynamic performance must be rigidly secured and immobile with respect to
their frame of reference defined in Article 3.3. Furthermore, these components must produce
a uniform, solid, hard, continuous, impervious surface under all circumstances.
Any device or construction that is designed to bridge the gap between the sprung part of the
car and the ground is prohibited under all circumstances.
With the exception of the parts necessary for the adjustment described in Article 3.10.10, or
any incidental movement due to the steering system, any car system, device or procedure
which uses driver movement as a means of altering the aerodynamic characteristics of the
car is prohibited.
The Aerodynamic influence of any component of the car not considered to be bodywork must
be incidental to its main function. Any design which aims to maximise such an aerodynamic
influence is prohibited.
3.2.3 Symmetry
All bodywork must be nominally symmetrical with respect to Y=0. Consequently, and unless
otherwise specified, any regulation in Article 3 concerning one side of the car will be assumed
to be valid for the other side of the car and references to maximum permissible numbers of
components in Article 3 will also refer to the one side of the car.
Minimal exceptions to the requirement of symmetry of this Article will be accepted for the
installation of non-symmetrical mechanical components of the car, for asymmetrical cooling
requirements or for asymmetrical angle adjustment of the front flap defined in Article 3.9.7.
Bodywork on the unsprung mass must respect this Article when the suspension position of
each wheel is virtually re-orientated so that its wheel coordinate system axes (described in
Article 2.11.3) are parallel to their respective axis of the car coordinate system (described in
Article 2.11.1).
3.2.4 Digital legality checking
The assessment of the car’s compliance with the Aerodynamic Regulations will be carried out
digitally using CAD models provided by the teams. In these models:
a. Components may only be designed to the edge of a Reference Volume or with a precise
geometrical feature, or to the limit of a geometrical criterion (save for the normal
round-off discrepancies of the CAD system), when the regulations specifically require an
aspect of the bodywork to be designed to this limit, or it can be demonstrated that the
design does not rely on lying exactly on this limit to conform to the regulations, such
that it is possible for the physical bodywork to comply.
b. Components which must follow a precise shape, surface or plane must be designed
without any tolerance, save for the normal round-off discrepancies of the CAD system.
3.2.5 Physical legality checking
The cars may be measured during a Competition in order to check their conformance to the
CAD models discussed in Article 3.2.4 and to ensure they remain inside the Reference
Volumes.
a. Unless otherwise specified, a tolerance of ±3mm will be accepted for manufacturing
purposes only with respect to the CAD surfaces. Where measured surfaces lie outside of
this tolerance but remain within the Reference Volumes, a Competitor may be required
to provide additional information (e.g. revised CAD geometry) to demonstrate
compliance with the regulations. Any discrepancies contrived to create a special
aerodynamic effect or surface finish will not be permitted.
2024 Formula 1 Technical Regulations 14 25 April 2023
© 2023 Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile Issue 1
b. Irrespective of a), geometrical discrepancies at the limits of the Reference Volumes
must be such that the measured component remains inside the Reference Volume.
c. A positional tolerance of +/- 2mm will be accepted for the Front Wing Bodywork, Rear
Wing Bodywork, Exhaust Tailpipe, Floor Bodywork behind XR=0, and Tail. This will be
assessed by realigning each of the groups of Reference Volumes and Reference Surfaces
that define the assemblies, by up to 2mm from their original position, to best fit the
measured geometry.
d. Irrespective of b), a tolerance of Z=+/-2mm will be accepted for parts of the car lying on
the Z=0 plane, with -375 ≤ Y ≤ 375 and ahead of XR=0.
e. Minimal discrepancies from the CAD surfaces will also be accepted in the following
cases:
i. Minimal repairs carried out on aerodynamic components and approved by the FIA
ii. Tape, provided it does not achieve an aerodynamic effect otherwise not
permitted by Article 3
iii. Junctions between bodywork panels
iv. Local bodywork fixing details
3.2.6 Datum Points
All cars must be equipped with mountings for optical targets that enable the car’s datum to
be determined for scrutineering in the following locations:
i. One on the forward part of the top of the survival cell.
ii. Two positioned symmetrically about Y=0 on the top of the survival cell close to XB=0.
iii. Two positioned symmetrically about Y=0 on the side of the survival cell close to XB=0.
iv. Two positioned symmetrically about Y=0 on the side of the survival cell close to the rear
mounts of the secondary roll structure.
v. Two positioned symmetrically about Y=0 within an axis-aligned cuboid with an interior
diagonal defined by points [XC=0, 175, 970] and [XC=150, -175, 870].
vi. One probed point on the RIS or gearbox case.
In all cases, a file with required datum points must be supplied for each survival cell.
For deflection testing, all cars must be provided with a means of mounting a reference
artefact to the RIS. This mounting may be temporary, but must be rigid with respect to the
underlying car structure.
Full details of the requirements are given in the Appendix the Technical and Sporting
Regulations.
3.2.7 Section titles and Article titles within this article have no regulatory value.
3.2.8 Static pressure tappings are permitted in surfaces, provided that they;
i. Have an internal diameter of no more than 2mm.
ii. They are flush with the underlying geometry.
iii. Are only connected to pressure sensors, or are blanked, without leakage.
3.3.1 Bodywork which is part of the sprung mass of the car
The only sprung mass bodywork permitted is that defined under Articles 3.5 to 3.12 and
under Articles 3.1.1.a.ii to iv. The frame of reference for every part of the car classified as
Sprung Mass Bodywork is the coordinate system defined in Article 2.11.1.
Any bodywork that is trimmed or filleted in Article 3.11 must first be declared as belonging to
one of the groups defined in Articles 3.5 to 3.10.
Unless otherwise stated, the compliance of an individual bodywork group to Article 3 will be
assessed independently and prior to any trimming, filleting and assembly operation referred
to in Article 3.11, and the FIA may request to see any discarded geometry after final
assembly. Once the final assembly is completed, any bodywork surfaces no longer exposed
to an external airstream or internal duct may be modified, providing they remain unexposed.
3.3.2 Wheel Bodywork
The only wheel bodywork permitted is that defined under Article 3.13. With the exception of
wheel covers, as defined in Article 3.13.7, the frame of reference for every part of the car
classified as Wheel Bodywork is the corresponding upright structure and the corresponding
coordinate system defined in Article 2.11.3.
The frame of reference for any wheel cover, as defined in Article 3.13.7 is the corresponding
wheel rim.
3.3.3 Suspension Fairings
The only suspension fairings permitted are those defined under Article 3.14. In order to
assess compliance with Article 3.2.2, the frame of reference of any suspension fairing is the
structural suspension member that it is attached to.","Compliance checking for Formula 1 cars involves several facets.  Aerodynamically, all components influencing performance must be rigidly fixed and create a uniform, hard, and continuous surface, except for driver-adjustable bodywork and specific flexible seals.  No ground-effect devices are allowed, and driver movement cannot be used to alter aerodynamics. Any aerodynamic influence of non-bodywork components must be incidental.  The car must be nominally symmetrical about the Y=0 axis, with minor exceptions for mechanical components, cooling, and front flap adjustment.  Digital legality checking uses CAD models, requiring components to be designed to reference volumes or specific geometric features. Physical checks ensure the car conforms to the CAD model and stays within reference volumes, with specified tolerances for manufacturing and assembly.  Datum points are required for scrutineering and deflection testing.  Finally, static pressure tappings are allowed with specific size, flushness, and connection restrictions.  Sprung mass bodywork, wheel bodywork, and suspension fairings are individually assessed for compliance before trimming, filleting, and final assembly.
","The compliance of Formula 1 cars with the technical regulations is ensured through several facets structured within the framework of the FIA regulations. First and foremost, compliance with Article 3, which addresses the aerodynamic performance and the impact of these regulations on racing conditions, is assessed by focusing on minimizing the aerodynamic performance loss when a car follows another closely. Teams may need to provide detailed information to the FIA, and while this data remains the intellectual property of the competitor, it is safeguarded against disclosure to third parties.

The regulations specify strict conditions concerning aerodynamic influence, symmetry, and digital legality checking. Aerodynamic components, except certain specified adjustable bodywork and flexible seals, must be rigidly attached and should not move relative to their frame of reference. The aerodynamic influence should be incidental to the component's primary function, and any deliberate design maximizing such influence is prohibited. Symmetry is also crucial; bodywork must be symmetrical about the car's longitudinal plane unless otherwise allowed for specific exceptions.

Digital legality checking involves assessing the car's design through CAD models to verify compliance with aerodynamic regulations. Designs must adhere to specified limits or demonstrate that deviation does not compromise regulatory conformity. Physically, cars are checked throughout competitions using these CAD models, ensuring measurements stay within set tolerances.

Tolerances are defined for various car parts, with specific allowances made for manufacturing purposes. Article 3.2.5 lists several conditions under which minor deviations are permissible, such as repairs or the use of tape, provided they do not create unauthorized aerodynamic effects.

Datum points are essential for scrutineering processes, ensuring that certain key locations on the car can be accurately measured. These points are crucial for deflection testing, and the car's structure must support their mounting.

Lastly, static pressure tappings are allowed on surfaces with restrictions on dimensions and must not leak nor be connected to anything other than pressure sensors. Rules also pertain to defining permissible bodywork associated with the car's sprung mass, wheel bodywork, and suspension fairings, each with its frame of reference outlined in respective sections of the regulations, ensuring comprehensive compliance coverage across the entire structure of the car.

In sum, various facets strictly enforced by the Formula 1 regulations cover aerodynamic components, symmetry, digital and physical legality checks, and detailed specifications for components, ensuring fair play and safety in the sport.","Based on the provided context, several key facets are checked for compliance in Formula 1 technical regulations:

 Key points
 Attention is a highly malleable quality and most directly influenced by the environment in which it is used.
 The internet creates a learning environment in which consistent attention is impossible, imagination is unnecessary, and memory is inhibited.
 Video games improve visual-spatial capabilities, increase attentional ability, reaction times, and the ability to identify details among clutter.
 Thinking. The capacity to reflect, reason, and draw conclusions based on our experiences, knowledge, and insights. It’s what makes us human and has enabled us to communicate, create, build, advance, and become civilized. Thinking encompasses so many aspects of who our children are and what they do, from observing, learning, remembering, questioning, and judging to innovating, arguing, deciding, and acting.
 There is also little doubt that all of the new technologies, led by the internet, are shaping the way we think in ways obvious and subtle, deliberate and unintentional, and advantageous and detrimental The uncertain reality is that, with this new technological frontier in its infancy and developments emerging at a rapid pace, we have neither the benefit of historical hindsight nor the time to ponder or examine the value and cost of these advancements in terms of how it influences our children’s ability to think.
 There is, however, a growing body of research that technology can be both beneficial and harmful to different ways in which children think. Moreover, this influence isn’t just affecting children on the surface of their thinking. Rather, because their brains are still developing and malleable, frequent exposure by so-called digital natives to technology is actually wiring the brain in ways very different than in previous generations.
 What is clear is that, as with advances throughout history, the technology that is available determines how our brains develop. For example, as the technology writer Nicholas Carr has observed, the emergence of reading encouraged our brains to be focused and imaginative. In contrast, the rise of the internet is strengthening our ability to scan information rapidly and efficiently.
 The effects of technology on children are complicated, with both benefits and costs. Whether technology helps or hurts in the development of your children’s thinking depends on what specific technology is used and how and what frequency it is used. At least early in their lives, the power to dictate your children’s relationship with technology and, as a result, its influence on them, from synaptic activity to conscious thought.
 Over the next several weeks, I’m going to focus on the areas in which the latest thinking and research has shown technology to have the greatest influence on how children think: attention, information overload, decision making, and memory/learning. Importantly, all of these areas are ones in which you can have a counteracting influence on how technology affects your children.
 Attention
 You can think of attention as the gateway to thinking. Without it, other aspects of thinking, namely, perception, memory, language, learning, creativity, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision making are greatly diminished or can’t occur at all. The ability of your children to learn to focus effectively and consistently lays the foundation for almost all aspects of their growth and is fundamental to their development into successful and happy people.
 Attention has been found to be a highly malleable quality and most directly influenced by the environment in which it is used. This selective attention can be found in the animal kingdom in which different species develop attentional skills that help them function and survive. For example, wolves, lions, tigers, and other predators have highly tuned visual attention that enables them to spot and track their prey. In contrast, their prey, including deer and antelope, have well-developed auditory attention that allows them to hear approaching predators. In both cases, animals’ attentional abilities have developed based on the environment in which they live.
 The same holds true for human development. Whether infant recognition of their parents’ faces or students paying attention in class, children’s immediate environment determines the kind of attention that they develop. In generations past, for example, children directed considerable amounts of their time to reading, an activity that offered few distractions and required intense and sustained attention, imagination, and memory. The advent of television altered that attention by offering children visual stimuli, fragmented attention, and little need for imagination. Then the internet was invented and children were thrust into a vastly different environment in which, because distraction is the norm, consistent attention is impossible, imagination is unnecessary, and memory is inhibited.
 Technology conditions the brain to pay attention to information very differently than reading. The metaphor that Nicholas Carr uses is the difference between scuba diving and jet skiing. Book reading is like scuba diving in which the diver is submerged in a quiet, visually restricted, slow-paced setting with few distractions and, as a result, is required to focus narrowly and think deeply on the limited information that is available to them. In contrast, using the internet is like jet skiing, in which the jet skier is skimming along the surface of the water at high speed, exposed to a broad vista, surrounded by many distractions, and only able to focus fleetingly on any one thing.
 In fact, studies have shown that reading uninterrupted text results in faster completion and better understanding, recall, and learning than those who read text filled with hyperlinks and ads. Those who read a text-only version of a presentation, as compared to one that included video, found the presentation to be more engaging, informative, and entertaining, a finding contrary to conventional wisdom, to be sure. Additionally, contrary to conventional educational wisdom, students who were allowed internet access during class didn’t recall the lecture nor did they perform as well on a test of the material as those who weren’t “wired” during class. Finally, reading develops reflection, critical thinking, problem-solving, and vocabulary better than visual media.
 Exposure to technology isn’t all bad. Research shows that, for example, video games and other screen media improve visual-spatial capabilities, increase attentional ability, reaction times, and the capacity to identify details among clutter. Also, rather than making children stupid, it may just be making them different. For example, the ubiquitous use of internet search engines is causing children to become less adept at remembering things and more skilled at remembering where to find things. Given the ease with which information can be found these days, it only stands to reason that knowing where to look is becoming more important for children than actually knowing something. Not having to retain information in our brain may allow it to engage in more “higher-order” processing such as contemplation, critical thinking, and problem-solving.
 What does all this mean for raising your children? The bottom line is that too much screen time and not enough other activities, such as reading, playing games, and good old unstructured and imaginative play, will result in your children having their brains wired in ways that may make them less, not more, prepared to thrive in this crazy new world of technology.","Reading encourages focused and sustained attention, imagination, and memory, much like a scuba diver in a quiet, visually restricted environment.  The internet, conversely, promotes rapid information scanning and fragmented attention, similar to a jet skier exposed to a broad vista and many distractions.  This constant distraction inhibits consistent attention, imagination, and memory.  Studies show uninterrupted reading improves comprehension, recall, and learning compared to reading text with hyperlinks and ads.  Students with internet access during class recalled less and performed worse on tests than those without access. Reading also develops reflection, critical thinking, problem-solving, and vocabulary better than visual media.

However, technology isn't entirely negative. Video games and screen media improve visual-spatial capabilities, attentional ability, reaction times, and the capacity to identify details among clutter.  Internet search engines prioritize knowing where to find information over rote memorization, potentially freeing up the brain for higher-order processing like critical thinking and problem-solving.  The article does not name specific technological advances, it uses the internet and video games as broad examples.
","The impact of technology on children's attention span can be both beneficial and detrimental, and understanding these influences requires examining the specific types of technology and how they are used. According to the provided text, attention is a malleable quality, highly influenced by the environment. The way technology is shaping this environment is of significant concern, as it affects children's ability to focus, imagine, and remember.

Reading has historically encouraged deep focus and imagination, akin to scuba diving, where readers are immersed in a quiet and distraction-free environment. This fosters sustained attention, critical thinking, and comprehensive learning. In contrast, the advent of the internet, likened to jet skiing, introduces children to a high-speed, distraction-rich environment. This exposure can result in fleeting attention spans, where consistency in focus, imagination, and memory is diminished.

Technological advances that negatively affect children's attention spans include the pervasive use of the internet, which conditions children to quickly scan information rather than engage deeply with it. The constant multitasking nature of digital environments—filled with hyperlinks, ads, and multimedia distractions—has been shown to hinder attention and learning. For instance, children with internet access during a class demonstrate poorer recall and understanding of material compared to those without such distractions.

However, not all technology negatively impacts attention. Some forms, like video games, can positively influence attentional skills. They have been shown to improve visual-spatial capabilities and reaction times, and enhance the ability to identify details amid clutter. This suggests that while technology can be a source of distraction, it also offers opportunities for developing specific cognitive skills, particularly in selectively attending to important details.

The shift in attention due to technology also includes changes in memory usage. With the rise of internet search engines, children may become less proficient at remembering information itself but better at remembering where to find it. This shift suggests that the role of memory is evolving to prioritize retrieval skills and efficient information location over mere content retention. This could potentially free up cognitive resources for higher-order thinking processes, such as critical thinking and problem-solving.

Ultimately, the text suggests that the balance between technology use and other activities like reading is crucial for children's cognitive development. Excessive screen time without the counterbalance of traditional activities such as reading, imaginative play, and non-digital games may lead to less adaptive brain wiring for thriving in our modern, technology-driven world.

In conclusion, technology and reading affect children's attention spans in contrasting ways. Reading fosters deep and focused attention, crucial for imagination and critical thinking, whereas modern digital technologies often encourage quicker, surface-level engagement. However, certain technologies can enhance specific attentional skills, indicating that the effects are not entirely negative. The key lies in how technology is used and balanced with other activities in nurturing children's cognitive capacities.","Based on the provided text, here's how technology and reading differently affect children's attention span:

Reading Effects:
- Traditional reading requires intense and sustained attention
- Promotes focused, uninterrupted thinking
- Encourages imagination and memory use
- Develops reflection, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills
- Creates an environment for deep focus with few distractions

Negative Technological Effects:
- Internet usage makes consistent attention impossible
- Creates an environment where distraction is the norm
- Hyperlinks and ads in texts lead to slower completion and worse understanding
- Internet access during classes reduces lecture recall and test performance
- Television offers fragmented attention and reduces the need for imagination

Positive Technological Effects:
- Video games improve visual-spatial capabilities
- Increase attentional ability
- Improve reaction times

 [context document]",Can you summarize what happened in the Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co. decision? What act supported the right to include color to qualify as a trademark? Explain in a minimum of 200 words how the act's language supported Qualitex Co.'s opinion.,"The case before us grows out of petitioner Qualitex Company's use (since the 1950's) of a special shade of green-gold color on the pads that it makes and sells to dry cleaning firms for use on dry cleaning presses. In 1989, respondent J acobson Products (a Qualitex rival) began to sell its own press pads to dry cleaning firms; and it colored those pads a similar green gold. In 1991, Qualitex registered the special greengold color on press pads with the Patent and Trademark Office as a trademark. Registration No. 1,633,711 (Feb. 5, 1991). Qualitex subsequently added a trademark infringement count, 15 U. s. C. § 1114(1), to an unfair competition claim, § 1125(a), in a lawsuit it had already filed challenging Jacobson's use of the green-gold color.
 

 Qualitex won the lawsuit in the District Court. 21 U. S. P. Q. 2d 1457 (CD Cal. 1991). But, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit set aside the judgment in Qualitex's favor on the trademark infringement claim because, in that Circuit's view, the Lanham Act does not permit Qualitex, or anyone else, to register ""color alone"" as a trademark. 13 F.3d 1297, 1300, 1302 (1994).
 

 The Courts of Appeals have differed as to whether or not the law recognizes the use of color alone as a trademark. Compare NutraSweet Co. v. Stadt Corp., 917 F.2d 1024, 1028 (CA7 1990) (absolute prohibition against protection of color alone), with In re Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 774 F.2d 1116, 1128 (CA Fed. 1985) (allowing registration of color pink for fiberglass insulation), and Master Distributors, Inc. v. Pako Corp., 986 F.2d 219, 224 (CA8 1993) (declining to establish per se prohibition against protecting color alone as a trademark). Therefore, this Court granted certiorari. 512
 

 162
 

 u. S. 1287 (1994). We now hold that there is no rule absolutely barring the use of color alone, and we reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.
 

 II
 

 The Lanham Act gives a seller or producer the exclusive right to ""register"" a trademark, 15 U. S. C. § 1052 (1988 ed. and Supp. V), and to prevent his or her competitors from using that trademark, § 1114(1). Both the language of the Act and the basic underlying principles of trademark law would seem to include color within the universe of things that can qualify as a trademark. The language of the Lanham Act describes that universe in the broadest of terms. It says that trademarks ""includ[e] any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof."" § 1127. Since human beings might use as a ""symbol"" or ""device"" almost anything at all that is capable of carrying meaning, this language, read literally, is not restrictive. The courts and the Patent and Trademark Office have authorized for use as a mark a particular shape (of a Coca-Cola bottle), a particular sound (of NBC's three chimes), and even a particular scent (of plumeria blossoms on sewing thread). See, e. g., Registration No. 696,147 (Apr. 12, 1960); Registration Nos. 523,616 (Apr. 4, 1950) and 916,522 (July 13, 1971); In re Clarke, 17 U. S. P. Q. 2d 1238, 1240 (TTAB 1990). If a shape, a sound, and a fragrance can act as symbols why, one might ask, can a color not do the same?
 

 A color is also capable of satisfying the more important part of the statutory definition of a trademark, which requires that a person ""us[e]"" or ""inten[d] to use"" the mark
 

 ""to identify and distinguish his or her goods, including a unique product, from those manufactured or sold by others and to indicate the source of the goods, even if that source is unknown."" 15 U. S. C. § 1127.
 

 True, a product's color is unlike ""fanciful,"" ""arbitrary,"" or ""suggestive"" words or designs, which almost automatically
 

 tell a customer that they refer to a brand. Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537 F.2d 4, 9-10 (CA2 1976) (Friendly, J.); see Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U. S. 763, 768 (1992). The imaginary word ""Suntost,"" or the words ""Suntost Marmalade,"" on a jar of orange jam immediately would signal a brand or a product ""source""; the jam's orange color does not do so. But, over time, customers may come to treat a particular color on a product or its packaging (say, a color that in context seems unusual, such as pink on a firm's insulating material or red on the head of a large industrial bolt) as signifying a brand. And, if so, that color would have come to identify and distinguish the goods-i. e., ""to indicate"" their ""source""-much in the way that descriptive words on a product (say, ""Trim"" on nail clippers or ""Car- Freshner"" on deodorizer) can come to indicate a product's origin. See, e. g., J. Wiss & Sons Co. v. W E. Bassett Co., 59 C. C. P. A. 1269, 1271 (Pat.), 462 F.2d 567, 569 (1972); Car-Freshner Corp. v. Turtle Wax, Inc., 268 F. Supp. 162, 164 (SDNY 1967). In this circumstance, trademark law says that the word (e. g., ""Trim""), although not inherently distinctive, has developed ""secondary meaning."" See Inwood Laboratories, Inc. v. Ives Laboratories, Inc., 456 U. S. 844, 851, n. 11 (1982) (""[S]econdary meaning"" is acquired when ""in the minds of the public, the primary significance of a product feature ... is to identify the source of the product rather than the product itself""). Again, one might ask, if trademark law permits a descriptive word with secondary meaning to act as a mark, why would it not permit a color, under similar circumstances, to do the same?
 

 We cannot find in the basic objectives of trademark law any obvious theoretical objection to the use of color alone as a trademark, where that color has attained ""secondary meaning"" and therefore identifies and distinguishes a particular brand (and thus indicates its ""source""). In principle, trademark law, by preventing others from copying a sourceidentifying mark, ""reduce[s] the customer's costs of shopping and making purchasing decisions,"" 1 J. McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair Competition § 2.01[2], p. 2-3 (3d ed. 1994) (hereinafter McCarthy), for it quickly and easily assures a potential customer that this item-the item with this mark-is made by the same producer as other similarly marked items that he or she liked (or disliked) in the past. At the same time, the law helps assure a producer that it (and not an imitating competitor) will reap the financial, reputation-related rewards associated with a desirable product. The law thereby ""encourage[s] the production of quality products,"" ibid., and simultaneously discourages those who hope to sell inferior products by capitalizing on a consumer's inability quickly to evaluate the quality of an item offered for sale. See, e. g., 3 L. Altman, Callmann on Unfair Competition, Trademarks and Monopolies § 17.03 (4th ed. 1983); Landes & Posner, The Economics of Trademark Law, 78 T. M. Rep. 267, 271-272 (1988); Park 'N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly, Inc., 469 U. S. 189, 198 (1985); S. Rep. No. 100515, p. 4 (1988). It is the source-distinguishing ability of a mark-not its ontological status as color, shape, fragrance, word, or sign-that permits it to serve these basic purposes. See Landes & Posner, Trademark Law: An Economic Perspective, 30 J. Law & Econ. 265, 290 (1987). And, for that reason, it is difficult to find, in basic trademark objectives, a reason to disqualify absolutely the use of a color as a mark.","In *Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co.*, the Supreme Court addressed whether a color alone could be trademarked. Qualitex Co. used a specific green-gold color on its dry cleaning press pads since the 1950s.  Jacobson, a competitor, began using a similar color on their own press pads. Qualitex, having registered the color as a trademark in 1991, sued Jacobson for trademark infringement under the Lanham Act.  While Qualitex initially won, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision, arguing the Lanham Act didn't allow for the trademarking of ""color alone."" This conflicted with decisions from other circuits, leading the Supreme Court to take up the case. The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision, finding that color alone could indeed be trademarked.

The Lanham Act, according to the Court, supported Qualitex's position.  The Act defines trademarks broadly as ""any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof.""  The Court reasoned that this expansive language doesn't explicitly exclude color. Given that shapes, sounds, and even scents have been trademarked, the Court saw no reason why color couldn't function similarly as a ""symbol"" or ""device"" capable of carrying meaning.

Furthermore, the Lanham Act's functional definition of a trademark, requiring it to ""identify and distinguish"" goods and ""indicate the source"" of goods, even if unknown, was also met by Qualitex's use of color. While acknowledging that a color, unlike a fanciful word or design, doesn't automatically signify a brand, the Court pointed out that over time, a color can acquire ""secondary meaning.""  This occurs when consumers associate a specific color on a product with a particular brand. Just as a descriptive word like ""Trim"" on nail clippers can acquire secondary meaning and function as a trademark, the Court argued that color, under similar circumstances, could serve the same source-identifying function. The green-gold color on Qualitex's press pads, due to its long-time and exclusive use, had acquired secondary meaning, identifying the product's source as Qualitex in the minds of consumers.  The Court thus concluded that the Lanham Act's broad language encompassing ""symbol"" or ""device"" and its functional definition focusing on source identification both supported the trademarkability of color, provided it has acquired secondary meaning.
","In the case of *Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co.*, the dispute arose when Qualitex Company, which had been using a distinctive shade of green-gold on its press pads since the 1950s, discovered that Jacobson Products had begun selling press pads using a similar color in 1989. In response, Qualitex registered its special green-gold color as a trademark in 1991. They subsequently sued Jacobson for trademark infringement and unfair competition. While the District Court ruled in favor of Qualitex, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned this decision, arguing that the Lanham Act did not support the registration of color alone as a trademark.

The Supreme Court reversed the Ninth Circuit's decision, ruling that color alone could indeed be registered as a trademark under the Lanham Act. This decision was supported by the broad language used in the Act, which allows for the exclusive right to register a trademark, encompassing ""any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof."" The Court reasoned that colors, like words, symbols, or shapes, could act as identifiers of a brand or product source if they acquired a secondary meaning that distinguished the product.

The Lanham Act's wording does not restrict what can qualify as a trademark, allowing for a wide range of elements, including shapes, sounds, and even scents previously approved by the courts and the Patent and Trademark Office. The decision concluded that if these elements could serve as effective brand identifiers, there was no reason to exclude colors from serving the same role, provided they had acquired secondary meaning. The Court also highlighted that allowing color to serve as a trademark aligns with the goals of trademark law, as it aids consumer decision-making by reducing confusion and ensures that producers can benefit from the reputation of their products without deceptive competition.","Based on the provided passage, here's a summary of the Qualitex Co. v. Jacobson Products Co. decision and the relevant act's support:

The Lanham Act supported the right to include color as a trademark. In this case, Qualitex Company had been using a specific shade of green-gold color on their dry cleaning press pads since the 1950s. In 1989, Jacobson Products began selling similar pads in a similar color. Qualitex registered their green-gold color as a trademark in 1991 and sued Jacobson for trademark infringement.

The language of the Lanham Act supported Qualitex's position in several ways:

1. The Act defines trademarks broadly, including ""any word, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof"" (15 U.S.C. § 1127). This non-restrictive language doesn't exclude colors.

2. The Act allows trademarks that can be used to ""identify and distinguish"" goods and ""indicate the source of the goods."" The passage explains that while colors may not be inherently distinctive like invented words, they can develop ""secondary meaning"" over time, allowing customers to associate a particular color with a specific brand or source.

3. The fundamental objectives of trademark law, as supported by the Act, focus on the source-distinguishing ability of a mark rather than its specific form (whether it's a color, shape, fragrance, word, or sign). The law aims to:
- Reduce customer shopping costs by allowing quick identification of products
- Protect producers' rights to benefit from their product's reputation
- Encourage quality product production
- Prevent inferior product manufacturers from capitalizing on consumer confusion

The Supreme Court ultimately held that there was no absolute bar against using color alone as a trademark, reversing the Ninth Circuit's decision and supporting Qualitex's position based on the Lanham Act's inclusive language and objectives.",2387,1903,1880,2056.6666666666665

 Answer the question using only the information provided in the context. Do not rely on external knowledge or sources.","Provide me a summary of EI based on this reference, but organize it into two sections with one about the system itself and one about the actual benefits.","1.1.1 Summary
 The EI program, which is insurance-based, is designed to protect individuals who have lost their job for reasons outside their control, while they look for new employment or upgrade their skills. It may also help unemployed individuals across the country find employment. The EI program also provides temporary financial assistance to workers who are sick, pregnant, caring for a newborn or newly adopted child, or caring for a family member who has a serious medical condition.
 

 The EI program marked its 75th year in 2015, having been implemented in 1940. The last major reform occurred in 1996. At that time, the program introduced changes to better reflect its primary objective of promoting employment, and to better emphasize that access to the program is linked to significant work attachment.
 

 1.1.2 Roles and responsibilities
 Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) is the department of the Government of Canada responsible for developing, managing and delivering programs and services. The Minister of Employment and Social Development is responsible for the EI act, except for PART IV - Insurable Earnings and Collection of Premiums, and PART VII - Benefit Repayment.
 

 The Canada Revenue Agency is responsible for resolving any questions pertaining to the insurability of employment or earnings (Part IV), and for the collection of EI premiums (Part VII).
 

 Service Canada is a federal institution that is part of ESDC. Service Canada oversees all legislative provisions of the act, including the determination of benefit eligibility and entitlement, and issues EI benefits (Part I) directly to EI claimants. Its role is to provide timely and accurate EI benefit payments and services, and to support EI claimants through each stage of the service delivery process. It strives to accurately and efficiently provide benefit information, respond to enquiries, assist employers, process claims and provide the means to request a formal reconsideration of a decision, or to appeal decisions.
 

 Provinces and territories deliver the majority of Employment Benefits and National Employment Services (Part II). These benefits and services are delivered through Labour Market Development Agreements (LMDA) funded by the Government of Canada. Through these agreements, Government of Canada funding enables provinces and territories to design, deliver and manage skills and employment programs for unemployed individuals, particularly for those who are eligible for EI benefits.
 

 The Canada Employment Insurance Commission (CEIC) is a departmental corporation of ESDC. It plays a key role in administering the EI program, including the making of regulations, with the approval of the Governor-in-Council, and reviewing, as well as approving, policies related to the EI program administration and delivery. In addition to its role in EI premium rate setting, the CEIC produces the annual EI Monitoring and Assessment Report.
 

 The Social Security Tribunal of Canada (SST) is an independent administrative body composed of a General Division and Appeal Division, that makes decisions on appeals related to the Act.
 

 1.1.3 EI premiums & Insurable Employment
 All workers employed in insurable employment are required to pay EI premiums. The fact that a worker can or cannot qualify for EI benefits is not a criterion to determine whether EI premiums are payable, as it is the employment, and not the individual that is insured.
 

 The fundamental requirement for an employment to be insurable is that there is an employer-employee relationship; i.e. the person is not self-employed. CRA holds the responsibility for making decisions as to whether an employment is insurable or not, and whether EI premiums are payable with respect to that employment.
 

 1.1.4 Purpose of Employment Insurance benefits
 As previously stated, Part I of the EI program provides temporary income support to workers who have lost their job for reasons outside their control, while they look for new employment or upgrade their skills. EI Part I also provides temporary financial assistance to workers who are sick, pregnant, caring for a newborn or newly adopted child, or caring for a family member who has a serious medical condition.
 

 The purpose of Part II of the EI Act is to provide employment assistance to eligible insured participants, through various programs and services.
 

 1.1.5 Types of Employment Insurance benefits
 There are a number of types of EI benefits available:
 

 Regular benefits are available to individuals who lose their jobs for reasons outside their control and who are available for and actively seeking employment.
 

 Special benefits are available to insured workers and self-employed individuals who are too sick to work, are pregnant or have recently given birth, are providing care to a newborn or newly adopted child, or who must be away from work temporarily to provide care or support to a family member with a serious medical condition. Special benefits include:
 

 Maternity benefits: for biological mothers who are pregnant or have given birth. These benefits cover the period surrounding the child's birth (up to 15 weeks).
 Parental benefits: for any legal parent to care for their newborn or newly adopted child or children. One parent can receive these benefits, or they can share benefits between them (up to 40 weeks of standard parental benefits or 69 weeks of extended parental benefits when sharing). However, one parent cannot receive more than 35 weeks of standard parental benefits or 61 weeks of extended parental benefits.
 Sickness benefits: for people who cannot work due to injury, illness, or the need to be isolated in quarantine because they may be carrying a disease (up to 26Footnote1 weeks).
 Compassionate Care benefits: for people who must be away from work temporarily to provide care or support to a family member who is gravely ill with a significant risk of death within 26 weeks. One family member can receive these benefits, or they can be shared between several family members (up to 26 weeks).
 Family Caregiver benefits: for family members who must be away from work temporarily to care for or support a critically ill or injured family member. One family member can receive these benefits or they can be shared between several family members (up to 35 weeks for caring for a child; up to 15 weeks for caring for an adult).
 In certain circumstances various types of special benefits may be combined up to a maximum of 102 weeks of benefits within a maximum 104 week benefit period.
 

 Fishing benefits – are for eligible self-employed fishers who do not meet the eligibility requirements for EI regular benefits in their region.
 

 Job creation partnerships, work sharing, training benefits: for clients participating in developmental programs.
 

 [March 2019]","**The EI System**

The Employment Insurance (EI) program, established in 1940 and significantly reformed in 1996, is an insurance-based program designed to provide temporary income support to workers who have lost their jobs due to circumstances beyond their control.  It aims to help these individuals while they search for new employment or upgrade their skills. The EI program also offers temporary financial assistance to workers experiencing illness, pregnancy, caring for a newborn or newly adopted child, or caring for a seriously ill family member.  All workers in insurable employment are required to pay EI premiums, regardless of their eligibility for benefits.  The program is administered by several entities. Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) develops, manages, and delivers EI programs and services. Service Canada, part of ESDC, determines benefit eligibility and issues payments.  The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) decides whether employment and earnings are insurable and collects EI premiums. Provinces and territories deliver Employment Benefits and National Employment Services, funded by the Government of Canada through Labour Market Development Agreements (LMDAs).  The Canada Employment Insurance Commission (CEIC) plays a role in administration, including setting premium rates.  The Social Security Tribunal of Canada (SST) handles appeals.  EI benefits are divided into Part I (direct financial support) and Part II (employment assistance).


**Benefits of EI**

EI provides several types of benefits:  *Regular benefits* are for individuals who have lost their jobs involuntarily and are actively looking for work. *Special benefits* assist insured workers and the self-employed unable to work due to illness, pregnancy, childbirth, or caring for a newborn, newly adopted child, or a seriously ill family member.  These special benefits include: *Maternity benefits* for pregnant or recently given birth mothers; *Parental benefits* for parents caring for a newborn or newly adopted child, which can be shared between parents; *Sickness benefits* for those unable to work due to illness, injury, or quarantine; *Compassionate Care benefits* for individuals caring for a gravely ill family member; and *Family Caregiver benefits* for those caring for a critically ill or injured family member.  *Fishing benefits* are specifically for self-employed fishers who don't meet regular EI eligibility requirements.  Other benefits include support for those participating in job creation partnerships, work sharing, and training programs. Some special benefits can be combined, up to a maximum of 102 weeks within a 104-week benefit period.
","**EI System Overview:**

The Employment Insurance (EI) program is an insurance-based system established to support individuals who have lost their jobs due to factors beyond their control, while they search for new employment or seek to upgrade their skills. Additionally, the program aids unemployed individuals across Canada in finding work. The EI system extends temporary financial assistance to workers who find themselves unable to work due to sickness, pregnancy, caring for a newborn or newly adopted child, or attending to a family member with a serious medical condition. Managed by various entities within the Canadian government framework, Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) oversees the development and delivery of EI services, while Service Canada handles benefit eligibility and payment issuance. The Canada Employment Insurance Commission (CEIC) administers the program, including setting premium rates, and the Social Security Tribunal of Canada (SST) resolves appeals related to EI. The system encompasses Part I, which is focused on providing temporary income support, and Part II, which delivers employment assistance via provincial and territorial partners.

**Benefits of the EI Program:**

The EI program offers several distinct types of benefits designed to support Canadians during their times of need. Regular benefits are granted to those who lose their jobs due to circumstances outside their control and are actively seeking employment. Special benefits are available to individuals who cannot work due to circumstances like sickness, pregnancy, or family care responsibilities. These include maternity, parental, sickness, compassionate care, and family caregiver benefits, catering to different needs such as caring for a newborn, managing health issues, and providing support to critically ill family members. Furthermore, the program facilitates benefits for self-employed fishers, job creation partnerships, work sharing, and training benefits for clients in developmental programs. Collectively, these benefits ensure a safety net for workers, supporting them through temporary hardships and enabling them to actively participate in the labor market.","Here's a summary of EI organized into two sections based on the provided reference:

 <TEXT>
 [context document]","I'm starting up a business and need to decide very soon if I should have a brick-and-mortar or an online business, or if it's worth it to have both. Summarize key points in this article regarding the shift to online shopping and what I need to consider if I choose to operate solely online. Please make sure its 400 words or less.","Just as hybrid office-remote work arrangements have become more common, retail is becoming increasingly hybrid. The line between brick and mortar and e-commerce is now blurry, and in this evolving retail environment, many entrepreneurs are wondering the best way to position their small businesses for a prosperous year. Industry experts offered their predictions for the retail trends to watch this year.
 

 Tech will continue to shape retail 
 Technology is always remaking the retail environment, from creating self-service kiosks in stores to supporting the e-commerce boom. However, with the rapid evolution of digital technology, artificial intelligence and machine learning — and the need for retailers to stand out from the e-commerce crowd — tech adoption has become more pressing.
 

 The rate at which business owners opened e-commerce shops and consumers shopped online increased dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the trend has continued into the post-pandemic era.
 

 “Companies that put e-commerce at the heart of their business strategies are prepared for the post-COVID-19 era,” said Yomi Kastro, founder and CEO of e-commerce platform Inveon. “There is an enormous opportunity for industries that are still more used to physical shopping, such as fast-moving consumer goods and pharmaceuticals.”
 

 Even brick-and-mortar retailers should have some semblance of an e-commerce presence. Many consumers prefer to shop from the comfort of their own homes or at the spur of the moment. Consider offering your bestselling items in an e-commerce store to give your customers the option of purchasing your most popular products without visiting your physical location.
 

 Retailers are reducing packaging waste.
 As consumers become more environmentally conscious, look for retailers and brands to reduce their packaging waste, said Anthony Martin, CEO of Choice Mutual Insurance Agency. “Organizations will be more conscious about using recyclable or biodegradable packaging materials, which can be easily recycled or break down naturally in the environment,” he said.
 

 The movement toward more sustainable packaging can be seen in the emergence of companies developing new packaging materials out of plant-derived materials. Furniture giant IKEA, for example, said it plans to eliminate plastic packaging for new products by 2025 and all products by 2028. Many other large brands are moving in the same direction. 
 

 Technology will shape retail workforce management.
 Hiring and retaining quality workers will likely remain a challenge for retailers. One way businesses can adapt is by offering hybrid roles in which salespeople interact with customers online, thereby increasing their talent pool and reducing geographical limitations on the workers they can recruit.
 

 “An hourly workforce has unique pay rules, labor regulations, compliance obligations and scheduling needs,” he said. “Companies need technology that can support their growing requirements and evolve with their business. The pandemic [accelerated] the adoption of new digital technologies, which can save organizations money by increasing efficiencies and improving the experience of their employees.”

 U.S. retailers need to protect consumer data
 Consumer data protection will continue to be a major concern for U.S. retailers. High-profile data breaches not only cost retailers money but also damage their brands. And the stakes have only been heightened since the adoption of consumer data privacy laws such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
 

 “With the landscape of Google getting rid of third-party cookies and Apple accelerating its privacy-first approach, businesses of all sizes will become under greater scrutiny for how they protect customer data,” said Steffen Schebesta, CEO of global digital marketing platform Sendinblue. “My sense is that the learning curve will be steep for American companies, and if penalties apply, the lessons will be expensive. It will get especially messy if the regulations are not enacted on a federal level. This would force businesses to deal with state-by-state regulations.”
 

 While retail businesses collect consumer data for valid purposes, they need to ensure that information is highly protected from cyberattacks. Failure to defend sensitive customer data, such as financial information, could lead to massive lawsuits and fines, not to mention serious damage to brand reputation and lost opportunities for future business.
 

 Micro fulfillment centers bring merchandise closer to buyers
 With the e-commerce boom of recent years, massive fulfillment centers became a symbol of commerce. Jonathan Morav, head of product strategy at retail fulfillment company Fabric, said companies are now looking more to micro fulfillment centers, far smaller facilities that can be located closer to the residential areas where their customers live. They also enable businesses to take advantage of falling commercial real estate prices in downtown cities.
 

 Underutilized space in malls and parking lots can hold micro fulfillment centers. While an average Amazon fulfillment center is around 800,000 square feet, a micro fulfillment center typically takes up less than 50,000 square feet and is often as small as 10,000 square feet, while still fulfilling the expectations of fast, free shipping, Morav said. 
 

 Brick-and-mortar retailers will create special customer experiences
 Brick-and-mortar retailers have faced significant challenges as the industry has evolved. Retailers have a better chance of being successful if they create unique and memorable customer experiences by personalizing the shopping journey and making it fun.
 

 Personal shopping services will increase.
 Personal shopping services include online preorder and pickup, personal shoppers who walk customers through the showroom floor and much more. Personal shopping services create an extra layer of customer service that can enhance the overall experience and is difficult for e-commerce stores to replicate.
 

 Did You Know?
 Personalized shopping services don’t just enhance the customer experience; they create opportunities to cross-sell and upsell customers to drive more revenue.
 Automation in pricing will continue to rise
 In recent years, more and more companies have relied on automated technology to ensure their prices are properly set. Expect automated pricing tech to become even more commonplace, helping retailers reduce the amount of labor required by their staff.
 

 Omri Traub, an executive at restaurant point-of-sale software company Toast, expects automation to play an even bigger part in this arena going forward. He pointed to “a new wave of companies” that provide such automation solutions as a service. Once implemented, he said, the tech will provide “low implementation costs and [reductions in] operating costs.”
 

 Marketing and customer engagement will see changes.
 Customers now primarily engage with small retail stores in an online, mobile-friendly model. That’s shifted the paradigm for marketers and customer engagement specialists, and the trend will continue this year.
 

 Social media will continue to introduce customers to brands.
 Social media is a major driver of the customer journey and online sales for many companies. Going forward, experts expect that hashtags and meme culture will play as large a role as traditional advertising methods for successful small businesses and their younger customers. One way that will happen, Gabor said, is through “creative social commerce,” in which platforms such as TikTok and Instagram fuel online shopping.
 

 This includes experiential marketing, such as live events that are streamed over social media platforms. Whether people engage with the brand in person or online, these types of events offer widespread exposure.
 

 Influencers will keep playing a big role.
 Love them or hate them, influencers will remain relevant for nearly every retail brand. With companies highlighting authentic voices, Gabor said, consumers will be able to look for leadership among those individuals.

 The rise of cryptocurrencies has led to a reevaluation of financial regulations. Traditional financial systems are governed by a range of regulations designed to prevent fraud, money laundering, and other illicit activities. As cryptocurrencies operate outside conventional banking systems, regulators have had to adapt their approaches to address these new challenges.
 

 Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) Regulations: Cryptocurrencies have attracted regulatory attention due to their potential for facilitating money laundering and other illegal activities. In response, jurisdictions like the European Union have enacted measures such as the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD), which requires cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers to comply with AML and KYC regulations. This includes verifying customer identities and monitoring transactions to prevent illicit activities.
 

 Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Guidelines: The FATF, an international body that sets standards for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, has issued guidelines for the cryptocurrency industry. These guidelines mandate that virtual asset service providers (VASPs) adhere to similar regulatory standards as traditional financial institutions, including transaction monitoring and reporting requirements.
 

 Regulatory Responses in Different Regions: Different countries have taken varied approaches to cryptocurrency regulation. For instance, the United States has implemented a patchwork of federal and state regulations, with agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) overseeing different aspects of the market. In contrast, countries like China have imposed strict bans on cryptocurrency trading and mining, reflecting a more cautious stance.
 

 Implications for Retail and Product Industries
 

 The adoption of cryptocurrencies in retail and product industries introduces both opportunities and risks. As more retailers accept digital currencies as payment, they must navigate new regulatory and cybersecurity challenges.
 

 Cybersecurity Concerns: Retailers accepting cryptocurrencies must enhance their cybersecurity measures to protect against potential breaches. Blockchain technology, while secure, is not immune to attacks. Hacks targeting cryptocurrency exchanges and digital wallets have highlighted the need for robust security protocols. Retailers must invest in secure payment systems and educate staff on best practices for managing digital assets.
 

 Consumer Protection: The use of cryptocurrencies in retail transactions raises questions about consumer protection. Regulatory bodies are working to establish standards for ensuring fair practices and protecting consumer rights. For example, regulations may require retailers to provide clear information about the risks associated with cryptocurrency transactions and to implement mechanisms for resolving disputes.
 

 Impact on Product Safety: In the product sector, the integration of blockchain technology offers potential benefits such as improved traceability and transparency in supply chains. Blockchain can be used to track the provenance of goods, verify authenticity, and ensure compliance with safety standards. However, the technology also necessitates updates to existing regulatory frameworks to address issues related to data privacy and accuracy.
 

 Conclusion
 

 Blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies are reshaping the financial landscape, prompting significant changes in regulatory frameworks. As these technologies continue to evolve, regulators and industries must adapt to new challenges and opportunities. By staying informed and proactive, stakeholders can navigate the complexities of the digital economy while ensuring compliance and protecting consumer interests.","Blockchain and cryptocurrency technologies have significantly impacted financial compliance, necessitating an evolution in regulations and operational practices.  The decentralized and pseudonymous nature of these technologies presented challenges to traditional Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations.  This led jurisdictions like the European Union to enact measures such as the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD), requiring cryptocurrency exchanges and wallet providers to verify customer identities and monitor transactions. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) also issued guidelines mandating that Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) adhere to similar regulatory standards as traditional financial institutions, including transaction monitoring and reporting.  Different regions have adopted varied approaches, with the US implementing a mix of federal and state regulations overseen by agencies like the SEC and CFTC, while China has imposed strict bans.

Do not hallucinate any information outside the document.","Explain the bills described in the following context in detail. Connect the information so that a layman can understand, but do not omit any aspect of the laws.","Bills in the 116th Congress
Legislation Commissioning Agency Analyses
In January 2019, the House passed three bills that would commission studies concerning the use
of virtual currencies for illicit purposes. H.R. 56, the Financial Technology Protection Act, would
establish an Independent Financial Technology Task Force to Combat Terrorism and Illicit
Financing (Task Force) led by the Treasury Secretary.98 The bill would direct the Task Force to
(1) “conduct independent research on terrorist and illicit use of new financial technologies,
including digital currencies,” and (2) “develop legislative and regulatory proposals to improve
counter-terrorist and counter-illicit financing efforts.”
99 H.R. 56 would further require the Task
Force to annually report its findings to Congress.100 The bill would also establish two programs to
incentivize members of the public to assist the federal government’s efforts to combat the illicit
use of virtual currencies. First, the bill would direct the Treasury Secretary to establish a reward
of up to $450,000 for persons who “provide[] information leading to the conviction of an
individual involved with terrorist use of digital currencies.”
101 Second, the bill would direct the
Treasury Secretary to create a grant program “for the development of tools and programs to detect
terrorist and illicit use of digital currencies.”102 After passing the House in January 2019, H.R. 56
was referred to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
A second bill, H.R. 428, the Homeland Security Assessment of Terrorists’ Use of Virtual
Currencies Act, would similarly commission an analysis of the use of virtual currencies by
terrorists.
103 Specifically, H.R. 428 would direct the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for
Intelligence and Analysis to conduct a “threat assessment” analyzing “the actual and potential
threat posed by individuals using virtual currency to carry out activities in furtherance of an act of
terrorism, including the provision of material support or resources to a foreign terrorist 
organization.”
104 After passing the House in January 2019, H.R. 428 was referred to the Senate
Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.
Finally, H.R. 502, the Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act (the FIND Trafficking
Act), would direct the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a study “on how
virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used to facilitate sex and drug trafficking.”
105 The
bill would require GAO to provide Congress with a report summarizing the results of the study,
together with any recommendations for legislative or regulatory action that would assist the
federal government in combatting the use of virtual currencies to facilitate sex and drug
trafficking.106 After passing the House in January 2019, H.R. 56 was referred to the Senate
Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
H.R. 1414, FinCEN Improvement Act of 2019
In March 2019, the House passed H.R. 1414, the FinCEN Improvement Act of 2019.107 The bill
would, among other things, clarify that FinCEN’s statutory power to coordinate with foreign
financial intelligence units on antiterrorism and AML initiatives108
“includ[es] matters involving
emerging technologies or value that substitutes for currency.”
109 After passing the House in March
2019, H.R. 1414 was referred to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
H.R. 528, Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act
In January 2019, H.R. 528, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act, was introduced in the
House of Representatives.
110 The bill would create a safe harbor from federal and state money
transmitter licensing and registration requirements for certain blockchain developers. Specifically,
the bill would provide that noncontrolling “blockchain developers” and providers of a
“blockchain service” shall not be treated as “money transmitters,” MSBs, “or any other State or
Federal legal designation[s] requiring licensing or registration as a condition to acting as a
blockchain developer or provider of a blockchain service.”
111 A blockchain developer or provider
of a blockchain service would qualify as a noncontrolling developer or provider as long as it does
not have control over users’ digital currency in the regular course of business.112 Some
commentators have argued that such a safe harbor is necessary to provide legal certainty to actors
in the virtual currency space, including persons who contribute code to virtual currency platforms
or develop blockchain-related software but do not take custody of others’ virtual currency.
113
However, another commentator has noted that it is “debat[able]” whether federal registration
requirements apply to such persons.
114 H.R. 528 was referred to the House Committee on
Financial Services and the House Committee on the Judiciary in January 2019.","Several bills were introduced in the 116th Congress aiming to address the use of virtual currencies (like Bitcoin) and related technologies like blockchain.  Let's break down the key ones:

* **Combating Illicit Use:**  Three bills focused on understanding and fighting the use of virtual currencies for illegal activities:

    * **H.R. 56 (Financial Technology Protection Act):** This bill aimed to create a task force led by the Treasury Secretary to study how terrorists and criminals use new financial technologies, including digital currencies.  The task force would then propose new laws and regulations to combat this.  It also offered a reward (up to $450,000) for information leading to convictions and proposed grants to develop tools to detect these illicit activities.  This bill passed the House and moved to the Senate.
    * **H.R. 428 (Homeland Security Assessment of Terrorists’ Use of Virtual Currencies Act):**  This bill focused specifically on terrorist use of virtual currencies.  It tasked the Department of Homeland Security with assessing the threat and how terrorists might use these currencies, including providing support to terrorist organizations. This bill also passed the House and went to the Senate.
    * **H.R. 502 (FIND Trafficking Act):** This bill directed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used in sex and drug trafficking. The GAO would then report its findings and recommend any necessary legal or regulatory changes to Congress.  This bill passed the House and was sent to the Senate.

* **Improving Financial Intelligence:**

    * **H.R. 1414 (FinCEN Improvement Act of 2019):**  This bill clarified the authority of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the Treasury Department, to work with other countries on anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering efforts, specifically including new technologies and alternative forms of value that could replace traditional currency.  It passed the House and went to the Senate.

* **Protecting Blockchain Developers:**

    * **H.R. 528 (Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act):** This bill aimed to protect certain blockchain developers from needing to register as money transmitters.  Essentially, if a developer doesn't control the users' digital currency as part of their normal business, they wouldn't be subject to the same regulations as companies that directly handle money transfers.  This bill was introduced in the House but hadn't been voted on yet.  There's some debate about whether these developers even fall under current regulations.


In short, these bills represent different approaches to dealing with the rise of virtual currencies and related technologies.  Some focus on combating crime, some on clarifying existing regulations, and others on fostering innovation by protecting developers.
","In 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives passed several bills focused on the use of virtual currencies and emerging financial technologies, especially in relation to terrorism, illicit activities, and regulatory frameworks. Here is a simplified explanation of each bill:

1. **H.R. 56, the Financial Technology Protection Act**: This bill aims to counter the illegal use of new financial technologies, like digital currencies, for terrorism and other illicit activities. It proposes the creation of an Independent Financial Technology Task Force led by the Treasury Secretary. The Task Force's responsibilities include researching how these technologies are used for illegal purposes and suggesting new laws and regulations to improve efforts against terrorist and illegal financing. It also involves setting up a reward of up to $450,000 for information leading to the conviction of terrorists using digital currencies and creating a grant program to develop tools to detect such illegal uses.

2. **H.R. 428, the Homeland Security Assessment of Terrorists’ Use of Virtual Currencies Act**: This bill focuses specifically on how terrorists might be using virtual currencies to support their activities. It directs the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Intelligence and Analysis to assess the threats posed by the use of these currencies in terrorism, including providing support to foreign terrorist organizations.

3. **H.R. 502, the Fight Illicit Networks and Detect Trafficking Act (FIND Trafficking Act)**: This bill targets the use of virtual currencies and online marketplaces in facilitating illegal activities like sex and drug trafficking. It directs the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study these issues and report back to Congress, including any suggestions for new laws or regulations to help combat these activities.

4. **H.R. 1414, FinCEN Improvement Act of 2019**: Aimed at improving collaboration on anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering initiatives, this bill clarifies that FinCEN (the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network) can coordinate on issues related to emerging technologies and alternatives to currency, in partnership with foreign financial intelligence units.

5. **H.R. 528, the Blockchain Regulatory Certainty Act**: This bill offers a ""safe harbor,"" meaning legal protection, for certain blockchain developers from money transmitter licensing and registration requirements. It specifies that developers or service providers without control over users' digital currency shouldn't be treated as money transmitters by federal or state regulations. The bill seeks to provide a clear legal framework for those involved with blockchain technology but who do not handle digital currency directly.

Each of these bills takes a different approach to managing the challenges and opportunities presented by virtual currencies and digital financial technologies, aiming to prevent their misuse while fostering innovation and legal certainty.","Here's a simplified explanation of the bills described in the context:

1. H.R. 56 (Financial Technology Protection Act):
- Creates a special task force led by the Treasury Secretary to study how terrorists and criminals use digital currencies
- Requires annual reports to Congress
- Offers rewards up to $450,000 for information leading to conviction of terrorists using digital currencies

2. H.R. 428 (Homeland Security Assessment of Terrorists' Use of Virtual Currencies Act):
- Requires Homeland Security to assess how terrorists might use or are using virtual currencies
- Specifically focuses on analyzing threats from individuals using virtual currency for terrorism or supporting terrorist organizations

3. H.R. 502 (FIND Trafficking Act):
- Directs the Government Accountability Office to study how virtual currencies and online marketplaces are used for sex and drug trafficking
- Requires recommendations for laws or regulations to combat these issues

4. H.R. 1414 (FinCEN Improvement Act of 2019):

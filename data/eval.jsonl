Key selected projects include: building a new high-speed rail system between California and Nevada, which will serve more than 11 million passengers annually; creating a high-speed rail line through California\u2019s Central Valley to ultimately link Los Angeles and San Francisco, supporting travel with speeds up to 220 mph; delivering significant upgrades to frequently-traveled rail corridors in Virginia, North Carolina, and the District of Columbia; and upgrading and expanding capacity at Chicago Union Station in Illinois, one of the nation\u2019s busiest rail hubs. These historic projects will create tens of thousands of good-paying, union jobs, unlock economic opportunity for communities across the country, and open up safe, comfortable, and climate-friendly travel options to get people to their destinations in a fraction of the time it takes to drive.\n \n\n The Biden-Harris Administration is building out a pipeline of passenger rail projects in every region of the country in order to achieve the President\u2019s vision of world-class passenger rail. Announced projects will add new passenger rail service to cities that have historically lacked access to America\u2019s rail network, connecting residents to jobs, healthcare, and educational opportunities. Investments will repair aging rail infrastructure to increase train speeds, reduce delays, benefit freight rail supply chains to boost America\u2019s economy, significantly reduce greenhouse emissions, and create good-paying union jobs. Additionally, electric high-speed rail trains will take millions of cars off the roads and reduce emissions, further cementing intercity rail as an environmentally-friendly alternative to flying or driving and saving time for millions of Americans. These investments will also create tens of thousands of good-paying union jobs in construction and related industries \u2013 adding to over 100,000 jobs that the President is creating through historic investments in world-class rail.  \n \n\n Today\u2019s investment includes $8.2 billion through the Federal Railroad Administration\u2019s Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Program, as well as $34.5 million through the Corridor Identification and Development program to guide passenger rail development on 69 rail corridors across 44 states, ensuring that intercity rail projects are ready for implementation. President Biden will travel to Las Vegas, Nevada to make this announcement.\n \n\n To date, President Biden has announced $30 billion for rail projects across the country \u2013 including $16.4 billion on the Northeast Corridor, $1.4 billion for passenger rail and freight rail safety projects, and $570 million to upgrade or mitigate railroad crossings.\n \n\n Fed-State National Project selections include:\n \n\n The Brightline West High-Speed Intercity Passenger Rail System Project will receive up to $3 billion for a new 218-mile intercity passenger rail system between Las Vegas, Nevada, and Rancho Cucamonga, California. The project will create a new high-speed rail system, resulting in trip times of just over 2 hours \u2013 nearly twice as fast as driving. This route is expected to serve more than 11 million passengers annually, taking millions of cars off the road and, thanks to all-electric train sets, removing an estimated 400,000 tons of carbon dioxide per year. This project will create 35,000 jobs supporting construction and support 1,000 permanent jobs in operations and maintenance once in service. Brightline\u2019s agreement with the California State and Southern Nevada Building Trades will ensure that this project is built with good-paying union labor, and the project has reached a separate agreement with Rail Labor to employ union workers for its ongoing operations and maintenance. The project will also allow for connections to the Los Angeles Metro area via the Metrolink commuter rail system.\n The California Inaugural High-Speed Rail Service Project will receive up to $3.07 billion to help deliver high-speed rail service in California\u2019s Central Valley by designing and extending the rail line between Bakersfield and Merced, procuring new high-speed trainsets, and constructing the Fresno station, which will connect communities to urban centers in Northern and Southern California. This 171-mile rail corridor will support high-speed travel with speeds up to 220mph. The project will improve connectivity and increase travel options, along with providing more frequent passenger rail service, from the Central Valley to urban centers in northern and Southern California. New all-electric trainsets will produce zero emissions and be powered by 100% renewable energy. By separating passenger and freight lines, this project will benefit freight rail operations throughout California as well. This project has already created over 11,000 good-paying union construction jobs and has committed to using union labor for operations and maintenance.\n The Raleigh to Richmond (R2R) Innovating Rail Program Phases IA and II project will receive up to $1.1 billion to build approximately additional parts of the Southeast Corridor from Raleigh to Wake Forest, North Carolina, including new and upgraded track, eleven grade separations and closure of multiple at-grade crossings. The investment will improve system and service performance by developing a resilient and reliable passenger rail route that will also contribute to freight and supply chain resiliency in the southeastern U.S. The proposed project is part of a multi-phased effort to develop a new passenger rail route between Raleigh, North Carolina, and Richmond, Virginia, and better connect the southern states to DC and the Northeast Corridor. Once completed, this new route will save passengers an estimated 90 minutes per trip.\n The Long Bridge project, part of the Transforming Rail in Virginia \u2013 Phase II program, will receive $729 million to construct a new two-track rail bridge over the Potomac River to expand passenger rail capacity between Washington, D.C. and Richmond, VA. Nearly 6 million passengers travel over the existing bridge every year on Amtrak and Virginia Railway Express lines. This upgrade will reduce congestion and delays on this heavily-traveled corridor to our nation\u2019s capital.\n \n\n As part of President Biden\u2019s vision for world-class passenger rail, the Administration is planning for future rail growth in new and unprecedented ways through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law-created Corridor ID Program. The program establishes a new planning framework for future investments, and corridor selections announced today stand to upgrade 15 existing rail routes, establish 47 extensions to existing and new conventional corridor routes, and advance 7 new high-speed rail projects, creating a pipeline of intercity passenger rail projects ready for future investment.  \n \n\n Project selections include:\n \n\n Scranton to New York, reviving a dormant rail corridor between Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York, to provide up to three daily trips for commuters and other passengers;\n Colorado Front Range, a new rail corridor connecting Fort Collins, CO, and Pueblo, CO, to serve an area that currently has no passenger rail options;\n The Northern Lights Express, connecting Minneapolis, MN and Duluth, MN, with several stops in Wisconsin, for greater regional connectivity;\n Cascadia High-Speed Rail, a proposed new high-speed rail corridor linking Oregon, Washington, and Vancouver, with entirely new service;\n Charlotte to Atlanta, a new high-speed rail corridor linking the Southeast and providing connection to Hartsfield-Jackson Airport, the busiest airport in the world;", "full_prompt": "[question]\n Can you explain the new funding approved for passenger rail in the Investing in America Agenda?

Lung epithelial cells (LECs) secrete anti-microbial peptides, complement proteins, and defensins which enhance granulocyte activity and create a less hospitable environment for Coccidioides (Hern\u00e1ndez-Santos et al., 2018). To survive, Coccidioides must successfully avoid detection from surveying and patrolling innate immune cells. Lung-resident macrophages, also known as alveolar macrophages, comprise up to 95% of pulmonary leukocytes and participate in early immune detection of pathogens and maintain the lung microenvironment (Wynn and Vannella, 2016). In Aspergillus infections, tissue-specific neutrophils are recruited by LECs and enter the lung early after infection due to \u03b2-glucan and chitin (Dubey et al., 2014). Innate leukocytes control early pathogen invasion via phagocytosis and production of reactive oxide and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (Xu and Shinohara, 2017). \u03b2-glucan and chitin are conserved across many fungal species, including Coccidioides, so these molecules could interact with epithelial cells and aid in neutrophil recruitment. In cases where host immune responses cannot control infection, disease becomes chronic. Host responses sometimes control infections through granuloma formation in the lung as fungi is walled off instead of destroyed (Nguyen et al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2014; Wynn and Vannella, 2016).\n \n\n To survive lung defenses and evade innate immune responses, Coccidioides expresses virulence factors for immune evasion and survival. Inside the lung, arthroconidia express ornithine decarboxylase, an enzyme implicated during growth from arthroconidia to spherule state (Guevara-Olvera et al., 2000). During transition, the spherule internal cell wall segments bud off into endospores. Lifecycle transition allows vulnerable, easily phagocytosed, arthroconidia to develop into phagocytosis-resistant spherules (Hung et al., 2002; Gonzalez et al., 2011; Nguyen et al., 2013). Arthroconidia are vulnerable to RNS while mature spherules suppress nitric oxide species (NOS) and inducible NOS expression in macrophages (Figure 1) (Gonzalez et al., 2011). Mature spherules are too large for most host phagocytic activity, allowing Coccidiodes to evade early immune detection (Hung et al., 2002). Coccidioides induces host expression of arginase resulting in ornithine and urea production, important components for transition from arthroconidia to spherule (Hung et al., 2007).\n \n\n FGURE 1\n www.frontiersin.org\n Figure 1 Fungal dimorphism presents challenges for immune detection and activation. Early infection: Coccidioides is vulnerable to immune detection during early infection due to the smaller size (2\u20135 \u03bcM) and SOWgp expression which is detected via Dectin-1 and TLR2 on innate immune cells. These interactions mediate clearance via phagocytosis and reactive oxide species production. Later infection: As Coccidioides sporulates, it secretes MEP1 which digests SOWgp from the fungal surface, hampering immune detection. Spherules induce arginase expression in host tissues, suppressing NOS/NO production via an unknown mechanism, contributing to immune suppression.\n \n\n In the spherule state, Coccidioides secretes metalloproteinase 1 (Mep1) which digests an immunodominant antigen spherical outer wall glycoprotein (SOWgp) on the fungal surface (Figure 1) (Hung et al., 2005). Phagocytotic granulocytes rely on pathogen associated molecular patterns such as SOWgp, thus Mep1 secretion prevents detection by innate immune cells (Hung et al., 2005). Coccidioides upregulates nitrate reductase during development, an enzyme that converts nitrate to nitrite, thereby enhancing Coccidioides survival in anoxic conditions, such as those found inside a granuloma (Johannesson et al., 2006). Early detection to inhaled fungus is critical for host response. Macrophages and neutrophils detect Coccidioides arthroconidia and immature spherules via receptors Dectin-1, Dectin-2, and Mincle interacting with SOWgp (Hung et al., 2002; Nguyen et al., 2013). Endothelial lung cells use these same receptors to regulate defensin secretion.\n \n\n Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and c-type lectin receptors (CLRs) interact with major pathogen-associated molecular patterns to detect Coccidioides (Romani, 2004; Viriyakosol et al., 2008; Viriyakosol et al., 2013). Like most fungi, Coccidioides expresses \u03b2-glucans, chitins, and mannans in the outer cell wall (Nguyen et al., 2013). These cell components are recognized by a variety of TLRs and CLRs and elicit strong inflammatory responses from local immune cells. Coccidioides interactions with TLR2 and Dectin-1 on macrophages activate production of reactive oxide species (ROS) and inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) (Viriyakosol et al., 2008; Viriyakosol et al., 2013). There are no known nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like (NOD-like) receptors yet associated with Coccidioides detection.\n \n\n In humans, polymorphisms in IFN\u03b3/IL-12 signaling pathway result in a STAT1 gain of function mutations that associate with increased disease severity in Coccidioides, Histoplasma, and Candida infection (Sampaio et al., 2013). In disseminated Coccidioides, patients with severe disease were found to have a STAT3 mutation (Odio et al., 2015). STAT 3 mediates IL-23 signaling, critical for IFN\u03b3, IL-12, and IL-17 production while STAT1 signaling induces Th1 cell differentiation in response to IL-12 to produce IFN\u03b3; IFN\u03b3, in turn, inhibits Th17 differentiation (Yeh et al., 2014). IL-12\u03b21 receptor deficiency is associated with increased risk of disseminated coccidioidomycosis (Yeh et al., 2014). In chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis, gain of function mutations in STAT1 and STAT3 correlates to more severe disease and poor TH17 responses (Zheng et al., 2015). These observations suggest that STAT1 and STAT3 immune signaling is critical in host control of Th1/Th17 cytokine balance and is required for protection and Coccidioides fungal control.\n \n\n In Blastomyces dermatitidis infection, LECs regulate collaborative killing between alveolar macrophages, dendritic cells (DC), and neutrophils (Hussell and Bell, 2014; Hern\u00e1ndez-Santos et al., 2018). Upon LECs ablation, B. dermatitidis phagocytosis is reduced, and viable yeast numbers increase. Other data suggests that IL-1/IL-1R interactions regulate CCL20 expression in LECs. Chemokine CCL20 strongly recruits lymphocytes and weakly recruits neutrophils (Hern\u00e1ndez-Santos et al., 2018). IL-1R-deficient mice express less CCL20 and lung Th17 cells are reduced, suggesting that IL-1/IL-1R signaling in LECs could regulate adaptive immune functions (Hern\u00e1ndez-Santos et al., 2018). IL-1R is critical for vaccine induced resistance to Coccidioides infection via MyD88 induction of Th17 responses (Hung et al., 2014a; Hung et al., 2016a). Though it has not been explored, LECs could mediate early responses to Coccidioides through IL-1R, suggesting another innate immune cell role in anti-fungal responses within the lung tissues.\n \n\n Alveoli structure likely helps shape local immune responses. Three dominant cell types exist within and around the alveoli structure: Type 1 and Type 2 pneumocytes (also known as alveolar epithelial cells, AECs), and tissue-resident alveolar macrophages (Guillot et al., 2013; Hussell and Bell, 2014). Type 1 pneumocytes (AECI) secrete IL-10 constitutively, which bind to IL-10R on alveolar macrophages to maintain an anti-inflammatory state. Type 2 pneumocytes (or AECII) express CD200 which interacts with CD200R on alveolar macrophage to inhibit pro-inflammatory phenotype (Guillot et al., 2013; Hern\u00e1ndez-Santos et al., 2018). Alveolar macrophages express TGF\u03b2-receptors that bind to pneumocyte-expressed \u03b1v\u03b26 integrin, tethering them in the alveolar airspace. In inflammatory conditions, AECIs upregulate TLRs and AECIIs increase SP-A and SP-D production (Guillot et al., 2013). These surfactant proteins are known to enhance pathogen opsonization and phagocytosis, and are capable of binding to Coccidioides antigen (Awasthi et al., 2004). Coccidioides infected mice expressed less SP-A and SP-D protein in their bronchial lavage fluid compared to uninfected and vaccinated controls, demonstrating the pathogen\u2019s capability of altering the lung mucosa (Awasthi et al., 2004). AECII secreted production of surfactant proteins may be influenced by Coccidioides allowing fungal escape of phagocytosis and prolonged survival.", "full_prompt": "{instruction}\n ==========\n In your answer, refer only to the context document.

Lung epithelial cells (LECs) secrete anti-microbial peptides, complement proteins, and defensins which enhance granulocyte activity and create a less hospitable environment for Coccidioides (Hern\u00e1ndez-Santos et al., 2018). To survive, Coccidioides must successfully avoid detection from surveying and patrolling innate immune cells. Lung-resident macrophages, also known as alveolar macrophages, comprise up to 95% of pulmonary leukocytes and participate in early immune detection of pathogens and maintain the lung microenvironment (Wynn and Vannella, 2016). In Aspergillus infections, tissue-specific neutrophils are recruited by LECs and enter the lung early after infection due to \u03b2-glucan and chitin (Dubey et al., 2014).

The SK team has Fnaticon the ropes after\r\nbrilliantlydefending their base.

Back in the realworld,\r\ntheentireFnaticteamjumpsawayfrom theircomputersandpileontoXpeke whilewe hear, \"I\r\ndo not believe it! Xpeke's done it!\" Over 643,000 online viewers around the world watch the\r\ncamerapan acrossthe SK team, stunnedin theirdefeat. From theirhome computers, these\r\nviewers have just witnessed e-sports history.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 9\r\nThe above scene unfolded at the 2014 Intel Extreme Masters World Championships in\r\nLeague of Legends, a popular e-sports title. The solo maneuver that Xpeke performed on that\r\nstage has since made its way into common LeagueofLegends vernacular, being invoked in any\r\nmatch, casual or professional, where a player deftly ends a game singlehandedly. E-sports, which\r\nencompasses many more titles than League of Legends, has become a cultural phenomenon of\r\nsorts. People may wonder whether the whole scene is just a flash in the pan or something more\r\nsignificant.\r\nI begin this thesis in much the same way that I have begun many conversations over the\r\npast two years: defining e-sports. In most of those conversations, I simply say \"professional\r\nvideo-gaming\" and move on to other topics. Here, though, I fully elaborate on what e-sports\r\nmeans. More than just professional gaming, e-sports is an entire industry created around\r\ncompetitive gaming at all levels of play. An e-sport is not a just a sports video game like the title\r\nmight suggest, though some e-sports titles are sports video games. Instead, e-sports titles are\r\nmeticulously balanced, competitive, multiplayer games. Many games would fall into this\r\ncategory, but it takes a community of people to take an e-sport to the level of the classics like\r\nCounter Strike and Starcraft.\r\nSuch communities are core to the identity of e-sports. Indeed, this identity itself is an\r\noxymoronic collision of geek and jock culture; a mixture that media would have us believe acts\r\nlike oil and water. Even within e-sports communities lines are hazy and misdrawn. As Taylor\r\nand Witkowski (2010) show in their study of a mega-LAN event, the e-sports scene is fraught\r\nwith identity issues not only from outside, but within as well. The jock-like first-person-shooter\r\n(FPS) players competing at the same event as the nerdy, enigmatic World of Warcraft players\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n10\r\nshows the conflicting, lived masculinities in e-sports. Players are unsure whether to act like\r\nsuperstar athletes or tech-geeks. Can you be both?\r\nThe word e-sports alone evokes such a conflicting image. Electronic sports seems almost\r\nparadoxical in nature. Have we moved beyond a physical match of skill and extended our\r\ncontests to avatars in a digital world? How can two players sitting at a desk be sporting? As e-\r\nsports continue to grow not only as a segment of the gaming industry, but as a spectator affair,\r\nwe begin to see the 'sports' side of e-sports both challenged and invoked more frequently. In a\r\ntelling case, Twitter erupted after a Dota 2 tournament made an appearance on ESPN 2 in\r\n2014. With $10 million at stake, many e-sports fans thought the event warranted the attention of\r\nthe all-sports network. Plenty of viewers took to social media to praise the move made by ESPN.\r\nOthers were shocked: \"Espn2 is seriously airing an online gaming championship? Wtf man. This\r\nis our society now. That is not a sport\" (Hernandez 2014). The sports status of e-sports has been\r\nboth defended and attacked by journalists, academics, and fans alike.\r\nThe debate about the status of e-sports has been raging for many years. Witkowski's\r\npiece, \"Probing the Sportiness of E-Sports\", presents both sides of the argument pulling from\r\ngames studies scholars and assessing e-sports on their terms. Ultimately though, I believe she\r\nshelves the debate deftly when she states, \"sport is a personal experience... as many a sporting\r\nscholar has written before - if an individual considers the sporting activity they are engaged in to\r\nbe a sport... then it is a sport\" (2009, 56). I do not wish to rehash this debate. I have no stake in\r\nit. As Witkowski asserts, the attempt would be futile. Instead, I accept the role traditional sports\r\nhave played in the shaping of e-sports.\r\nIn fact, exploring the relationship between e-sports and their traditional counterpart drives\r\nthis work. In what follows, I argue that the sports media industrial complex has fundamentally\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n11\r\nshaped the current e-sports industry. Beyond this grounding, e-sports broadcasters constantly\r\nborrow from traditional televisual broadcasts, using models that they feel to be appropriate for\r\ntheir medium. Regardless of whether e-sports qualify as sports or not, they are constantly\r\ninformed by sports broadcasting and follow a trajectory set out by traditional sports models.\r\nThis work comes about at in an interesting moment in e-sports history. E-sports\r\naudiences have never been larger, Riot games boasted an impressive 27 million viewers for the\r\nLeague ofLegends World Championship in 2014 while the 2015 Intel Extreme Masters world\r\nchampionship saw over 1 million concurrent viewers across multiple live-streaming platforms\r\n(Riot Games 2014; ESL 2014). An old classic, CounterStrike, has re-emerged, albeit in a new\r\npackage. The audience it continues to draw proves that some titles have staying power in this\r\nfickle industry. At the same time, a new title, League ofLegends, consistently pulls in over\r\n100,000 concurrent viewers for its weekly shows in the U.S. and E.U. As the League ofLegends\r\nChampionship Series moves into its fifth season, it has come to resemble a traditional sports\r\nbroadcast more than it does its fellow e-sports shows. A new addition in Season 5, a segment\r\ncalled Prime Time League (PTL) is nearly indistinguishable from ESPN's Pardon the\r\nInterruption (PTI) at a glance.\r\nFigure 1-Left Image: Prime Time League; Right Image: Pardon the Interruption\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 12\r\nComparing these two images reveals the level of sports emulation found in e-sports broadcasting\r\ntoday. From the stats and schedule ticker at the bottom of the screen to the show rundown along\r\nthe edge of the screen, an uninitiated viewer would have difficulty distinguishing between the e-\r\nsports show and the traditional sports show.\r\nA steady influx of television producers and directors are starting to shape an industry that\r\nalready has an identity crisis while still investigating how best to harness the new medium of\r\nlive-streaming. These assertions are not meant to give the impression that we stand on the edge\r\nof wholly untouched land as pioneers in a new frontier. As shown in the e-sports literature\r\nreview to follow, the e-sports industry has a history of evoking the feeling of standing on a\r\nprecipice.\r\nOrganization\r\nIn the introduction, I first provide a brief history of e-sports and take note of the\r\ndirections e-sports scholarship has pursued. Following this review, I introduce the sports media\r\nindustrial complex to better situate e-sports broadcasting within the larger media landscape of\r\nsports broadcasting: the focus of chapter 1.\r\nThe first chapter begins by looking at the long history of sports and media. By\r\nintroducing the full gamut of sports media, I am better able to investigate how e-sports\r\nbroadcasting stays in conversation with each of its predecessors. As evidenced in the reshuffling\r\nof sports media through history, we can see that e-sports make use of all of these forms of media\r\nwhile creating something new. During this chapter, I look to the transition moments in traditional\r\nsports broadcasting as the foundation ofthe e-sports industry. Moments of tension and doubt\r\nwithin the sports media industry as it shifted from one medium to another provide perfect lessons\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 13\r\nto be learned by the e-sports industry as they struggle with some of the same issues found in the\r\nreshuffling of media history. Indeed, while making use of the same media through journalism,\r\npublic relations, and audiovisual broadcasts, the e-sports industry constantly wrangles with the\r\nuse of the newly emerged medium of live-streaming. Television especially influences live-\r\nstreamed broadcasts, which e-sports broadcasts tend to approach with the same framework as\r\ntelevision.\r\nChapter two focuses on e-sportscasters, also known as shoutcasters. I begin the chapter\r\nwith a brief look at the history of shoutcasting. Considering that many of the early shoutcasters\r\npull solely from traditional sportscasters, understanding their influences is crucial in\r\nunderstanding how e-sports has evolved in the way it has. As, I argue, the single most pointed\r\nsignaling of the sportiness in e-sports, these individuals have pushed the e-sports industry\r\ntowards a sports model. When first time viewers or listeners leave an e-sports broadcast with the\r\ndistinct feeling of a sports broadcast in their mind, it is the shoutcasters doing their job. They rely\r\nheavily on conventions set by traditional sportscasters. Much like their predecessors when faced\r\nwith something new, shoutcasters borrowed what they could and innovated when there was\r\nnothing to borrow. Chapter two also focuses on shoutcasters' formulation of their identity within\r\nthe e-sports industry as personalities, professionals, and record-keepers. Shoutcasters are just\r\nnow creating an identity separate from traditional sportscasting. Where veteran shoutcasters\r\nrelied primarily on traditional sports broadcasts, newer casters look instead to other shoutcasters.\r\nThese shoutcasters are reshaping their identity while attempting to fully embrace the new\r\nmedium of live-streaming.\r\nThe third and final chapter tackles the topic of economics in e-sports. As the history and\r\ntrajectory of sports broadcasting has profoundly affected the e-sports industry, many of the\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n14\r\neconomic models present in traditional sports bled into the e-sports industry as well. The e-sports\r\nindustry in the US and Europe has yet to be analyzed as such. Some work (Taylor 2012) has\r\nfocused on e-sports revenue streams including sponsorships, company models, and team\r\nownership, but overall, the subject remains underexplored. Dal Yong Jin's (2010) analysis of the\r\npolitical economy of e-sports in South Korea offers a tool set for this chapter. While the South\r\nKorean e-sports model spawned out of an extremely particular set of circumstances that cannot\r\nbe readily applied to the U.S. or E.U. e-sports scenes, Jin's investigation of the surrounding\r\neconomic systems surrounding e-sports translates well to my own investigation of the U.S. and\r\nE.U. industries. As staggering prize pools continue to make headlines, it is easy to lose sight of\r\nthe economic system working behind the scenes to keep e-sports financially salable, or in some\r\ncases not. The third chapter delves into traditional sports economics and their influence on the e-\r\nsports industry. In some areas, the models translate perfectly. In others, e-sports has been unable\r\nto tap into the same revenue generators as traditional sports. Unless some developments\r\nsignificantly alter the e-sports industry, it may be more tenable to pursue other models instead of\r\nthe sports industry.\r\nMethods\r\nThis thesis makes use of many qualitative methods including historical analysis,\r\ninterviews, and fieldwork. To grasp the significance and situation of e-sports broadcasting in its\r\ncurrent state fully, one must analyze the same developments in traditional sports broadcasting.\r\nAs one takes a deeper look into the past of the professional sporting industry, its influences on e-\r\nsports become clear. A feedback loop has been created between the two. Historical analysis\r\noffers a glimpse at key moments which defined the incredibly successful global sports industry.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 15\r\nNot only are similar situations appearing in e-sports, but e-sports pushes back into each of the\r\ninvestigated forms of media. A few of the issues currently facing e-sports could be resolved\r\nthrough following the path established by traditional sports, while other issues have been caused\r\nbecause so much has been borrowed.\r\nI also had the pleasure of conducting seven interviews with professional shoutcasters. I\r\nlimited the selection of shoutcasters to full-time professionals, rather than amateurs, to get an\r\ninsight into how these new professionals view their role within the industry. Roughly half the\r\nparticipants are veteran shoutcasters of five or more years. The other half have joined the scene\r\nmore recently with one in particular having shoutcasted professionally for less than one year. As\r\nthese informants are a few of only dozens of professional shoutcasters in the world, I have\r\nattempted to keep their identities anonymous. As professional personas, some of these casters\r\nmay benefit from being associated with this work, but I do not want to run the risk of potentially\r\nlinking these shoutcasters with their statements in the event that this information could somehow\r\naffect the community's perception of the individual or potentially harm their prospects within the\r\ne-sports industry. The conversations were all positive, but one can never truly assure their\r\ninformants that information they have provided in confidence will have no repercussion in any\r\nforeseeable future. With these considerations in mind I decided before conducting the interviews\r\nthat the informants would remain anonymous.\r\nFinally, I was also able to spend time working within the e-sports industry. My time spent\r\nworking for a prominent e-sports company profoundly shaped this thesis. Working alongside\r\nindustry professionals sparked countless conversations about the current climate of the e-sports\r\nindustry and possible futures. These conversations have both helped and challenged my thinking\r\nabout the e-sports industry. While I often refer to the e-sports industry or community as a\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 16\r\nhomogenous whole, the professionals who live within the space are not all of one mind and it\r\nwould be a mistake to present them that way. Within e-sports, there are many different games\r\nand communities vying for viewers, players, and attention. What follows is my best attempt at\r\nwrangling the many paths e-sports has started to follow.\r\nE-sports Literature Review\r\nE-sports is still a young industry and an even younger subject of critical inquiry. Most\r\nentries into e-sports scholarship have emerged within the last five years. E-sports literature tends\r\nto come from the much older tradition of games studies, but ties into many other fields including\r\nthe social sciences, cultural studies, economics, and law. Professional-gaming literature is a\r\nveritable hotbed of potential research topics with more articles, theses, and dissertations\r\nappearing every year. Much of the growing body of e-sports literature focuses on the\r\nprofessionalization of gaming (Jin 2010; Mora and Heas 2005; Swalwell 2009; Taylor, Nicholas\r\n2009; Taylor, T.L. 2012; Witkowski 2012). These histories offer much more than a rundown of\r\nthe events that created the e-sports industry. They also offer insight into our contemporary social\r\nmoment. The arrival of a professionalization of video gaming signals many significant\r\ndevelopments within both western and non-western culture. The global nature of e-sports and its\r\nmeshing together of complex and often conflicting identities continues to beg investigation.\r\nE-sports literature primarily resides within the social sciences. Many cultural analyses in\r\ne-sports (Chee and Smith 2005; Harper 2010 and 2014; Hinnant 2013; Swalwell 2009; Taylor\r\n2011) have focused on the communities growing within different scenes. Todd Harper, for\r\ninstance, investigates the culture of competitive fighting games, a fascinating community which\r\nstands both within and at odds with the rest of competitive gaming. Gender studies are also\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 17\r\nbecoming increasingly common within e-sports literature (Chen 2006; Crawford 2005; Leonard\r\n2008; Taylor 2009 and 2011; Taylor and Witkowski 2010; Witkowski 2013). With the\r\nfascinating and fraught formulation of masculinity within these spaces as well as the perceived\r\nabsence of femininity, gender studies are incredibly important within e-sports literature. Nicholas\r\nTaylor (2011) offers insight into the ability of e-sports to create embodied performances of\r\nmasculinity at live events which spread through communities specific to certain titles or genres.\r\nTaylor and Witkowski (2010) also show the conflicting versions of masculinity that appear in\r\ndifferent e-sports genres.\r\nThere has also been an increasing focus on e-sports as a spectator activity. Jeff Huang\r\nand Gifford Cheung (2012) found in a study that many of the e-sports fans they investigated\r\nprefer watching high-level play rather than playing a match themselves. Kaytou and Raissi\r\n(2012) also investigate spectatorship in e-sports with a focus on how best to measure live-\r\nstreaming audiences. Others (Bowman 2013; Gommesen 2012; Kow and Young 2013) show that\r\nthe audience in e-sports has a profound effect on performance for the players, akin to a\r\ntraditional sports audience. These scholars also investigate the expertise apparent in e-sports\r\nplayers that is passed on through spectating as often as practicing.\r\nAs the professional play of video games fascinates so many, e-sports literature has\r\nunderstandably focused primarily on professional players. Notable exceptions include Jin (2012)\r\nand Taylor (2012) who, while still heeding players, also investigate the surrounding factors\r\nwhich allow for play at a professional level. Without these other factors, professional players\r\nwould not exist. It is from the tradition of these two authors, among others, that I base this work.\r\nThis thesis, like many of the works listed above seeks to better understand the phenomenon of e-\r\nsports while analyzing a particular segment of the scene. With few investigations into the\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 18\r\nbroadcasting of e-sports, I hope to contribute to e-sports literature in a way that is both unique\r\nand replicable to other systems found within the larger e-sports framework.\r\nSports Media Industrial Complex\r\nAs sport and media become increasingly intertwined, it becomes difficult to analyze one\r\nwithout at least acknowledging the impact of the other. Pointing to the inextricable link between\r\nsports and media, sports media scholar K. Lefever (2012) argues, \"while sport provides valuable\r\ncontent and audiences for media operators, the media is a revenue source and promotional tool\r\nfor sport.\" As such, the steady professionalization and, in turn, commercialization of sport relies\r\nheavily on its media counterpart. The subsequent interdependence between media outlets,\r\nsponsors, and sports leagues creates what is often referred to as the sports/media complex or\r\nsports media industrial complex (Jhally 1989, Rowe 1999, Maguire 1991). Wenner (1989)\r\ncoined the neologism, MediaSport, to define the deeply rooted relationship between sports and\r\nmedia. The two can hardly be considered separate anymore.\r\nStein (2013), a Comparative Media Studies alumni, building on the work of these earlier\r\nscholars created a model which could be applied to new arrivals in the sports media landscape.\r\nThankfully, Stein provides a fairly replicable analysis of sports video games within the broader\r\nsports media landscape. His investigation of the relationship between televisual sports video\r\ngames and sports media largely informs my own work. He notes an almost relentless stream of\r\nadvertising and commercialization rhetoric appearing in sports video games. Building on the\r\nwork of Wenner, Rowe, and Jhally, he argues that the commodification and capitalist trends\r\nfound in traditional sports broadcasting bleed into newer media such as video games. This steady\r\ninflux of advertising and commercialization can be found in e-sports as well.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 19\r\nAs e-sports broadcasters gain more experience and access to more robust technology,\r\nthey have started to incorporate many of the same commercial opportunities Stein noticed in\r\nsports video games. Segments of the broadcast are occasionally sponsored, or one might see a\r\nsponsor make an appearance in an event's title such as the Intel Extreme Masters tournament.\r\nWhere Stein argues that sports video games incorporate these advertisements as a signifier of\r\ntheir televisual legitimacy, I argue that e-sports broadcasters make use of the same strategies\r\nbecause they are informed by earlier forms of sports media.\r\nThe steady commercialization found in e-sports reveals the influence that the sports\r\nmedia industrial complex has had on the e-sports industry. In documenting the dynamics of the\r\nsports media industrial complex, Jhally (1989) argues that sports are best viewed as\r\ncommodities. Jhally's model focuses on the sporting industry in the US prior to the emergence of\r\nnew media. More readily applicable to e-sports, Lefever's (2012) analysis of the sports media\r\ncomplex within new media details a phenomenon which has upended the former relationships\r\nbetween stakeholders in the sports media industrial complex. She claims that, \"the sports/media\r\ncomplex has somehow changed, allowing the different stakeholders to take up new roles\"\r\n(Lefever 2012, 13). The stakeholders, including sports franchises, sponsors, and media outlets,\r\nhave had to adapt to a new media landscape with new roles. These new roles are more transient\r\nwithin the high-demand world of new media. Sports organizations and franchises have taken a\r\nmore active role in connecting with fans, media outlets have taken a larger interest in sports\r\nfranchises (often buying sports franchises if it is less expensive than purchasing media rights),\r\nand sponsors have taken advantage of new, innovative ways to reach consumers (Lefever 2012,\r\n21). According to sports scholars Haynes and Boyle (2003), television sports viewers are no\r\nlonger expected to just sit back and relax. Instead they are expected to follow their sport through\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 20\r\nsocial media, forums, blogs, and other digital outlets. This new, active fan fits well within the e-\r\nsports industry and live-streaming, but has changed the traditional sports media industrial\r\ncomplex. Before delving too far into the role of traditional sports economic models on e-sports,\r\nhowever, I will first situate live-streaming and e-sports within the larger sports media industrial\r\ncomplex.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n21\r\nChapter 1\r\nSports Media in Transition From Print to Live-Streaming\r\nEvery day, millions of Americans are catching up with the latest sports news through\r\nprint, radio, television, and online. Sports have saturated the entire spectrum of mass media in\r\nthe US. With the emergence of each form of mass media, sports coverage has been at the\r\nforefront of adoption and innovation (Bryant and Holt 2006, 22). Each major medium shift in the\r\nUS has been accompanied by a massive reshuffling of the sports media landscape. Often, this\r\nreshuffling opens a space for a particular sport to take up the new medium, create conventions,\r\nand carve a path for others to follow. These sports were not spawned by mass media, but their\r\nspike in popularity around the emergence of a new medium indicates very specific social\r\nmoments in the US. Early sports magazines and print coverage of sports focused primarily on\r\nprize-fighting, radio ushered in the golden era of baseball, and television transformed football\r\ninto a titanic entertainment industry. The rise and stabilization of sports media are as much a\r\nproduct of available technology as they are indicative of societal preoccupations of the time. If\r\nsports and sports media are indicative of our social moment, then what can we glean from the\r\narrival of live-streaming and e-sports?\r\nThe co-evolution of sports and media is the coalescence of many factors including\r\nchanges in power structures, modes of production, and available technology. As Bryant and Holt\r\nargue in their investigation of the history of sports and media, \"[e]ach epoch of social evolution\r\nhas witnessed important sports-media developments that were affected by the evolving socio-\r\ncultural environment\" (2006, 22). In what follows, I trace the co-evolution of sports and media\r\nwith particular focus on the relationship between emerging mass media and the media ecology\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 22\r\nsurrounding that emergence. By documenting these moments of turbulence, I establish the\r\nframework necessary to analyze live-streaming as a new medium with which e-sports has\r\nemerged as an early adopter and convention creator. Live-streaming did not emerge\r\nindependently from its predecessors, but rather delivers on the preoccupations of our current\r\nsocial moment. It has once again started a reshuffling of the roles of media within the sports\r\nmedia complex. E-sports, while primarily viewed through live-streaming, relies on all of the\r\nprevious forms of media to varying degrees. With this framework in mind, I argue that the\r\nfeedback between live-streaming, e-sports, and traditional sports has spawned an industry which\r\nroots itself in traditional sports media while still investigating the full potential of live-streaming.\r\nI begin by briefly discussing sports media in antiquity with Thomas Scanlon's (2006)\r\npiece on ancient Mediterranean sports and media. After this introduction to sports media, I move\r\nto the US in the late eighteenth century with the emergence of the first sports-only publication,\r\nthe sports magazine, as well as early print news coverage of prize fighting during the rise of\r\nindustrialization and nationalism. The next section maps the push towards immediacy in sports\r\ncoverage and the rise of radio. On the heels of radio and the golden age of baseball, I discuss the\r\nearly issues with televised sport before the post-war era. Moving into the 1950s and 1960s, I\r\ndetail the transformation of football into a televisual sport accompanied by a very specific social\r\ncontingency. I then transition into an investigation of live-streaming and e-sports, particularly\r\nhow both are in conversation with sports media history.\r\nOrigins of Sports Media\r\nAs classicist Thomas Scanlon (2006) posits, there is no history of sports without its\r\nmedia counterpart. Media in antiquity, he argues, \"are a tool of society, a means of transmitting a\r\nmessage, primarily one from the rulers to the ruled\" (Scanlon 2006, 17). While his definition is\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 23\r\nquite limited, Scanlon is correct in noting that media are inflected with the power structures of a\r\nsociety. Sports as media were classically used by those with power to reinforce the hierarchy.\r\nSports events were \"represented as a benevolent benefaction from the rich, noble, and\r\nempowered to those marginalized\" (Scanlon 2006, 18). This reinforcement of power structures\r\ncomes through not only in the production of sporting events, but also in the medium itself.\r\nScanlon suggests that the most powerful sports 'medium' in classical times was Roman\r\narchitecture. The massive circuses and arenas were meant to \"provoke awe, admiration, and\r\nobedience in the citizens\" (Scanlon 2006, 18). Scanlon establishes that the predominant sports\r\nmedium in a given society correlates directly with their notions of power. Within the realm of\r\nmore dispersed authority such as the Ancient Greeks, sports media reflected the high value of an\r\nindividual and his merits. Depictions of athletics in Ancient Greek poetry and pottery, made by\r\nand for the common people, focus on a particular athlete's prowess more than the event itself. On\r\nthe other hand, societies with incredibly rigid hierarchies and god-kings such as the Ancient\r\nEgyptians and Persians, tend to represent sports as a demonstration of the ruler's power over\r\ntheir people. Ancient Rome, with its centrally focused authority, used architecture to demonstrate\r\nthe power of the nobility as both benefactors and arbiters, diminishing the role of the athlete to\r\nthat of an entertainer. Moving into more recent history with media such as newspapers and radio,\r\nScanlon concludes that sports media became an amalgamation of both the Roman and Greek\r\nstyles: large spectacles with massive personalities.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 24\r\nEstablishing a Media Landscape: Early Sports Media in America\r\nThe importance of the printing press on modem society cannot be overstated. While its\r\nprecise effects are still being debated', the affordances of the printing press allowed individuals\r\nto produce and disseminate a massive amount of information far more efficiently than ever\r\nbefore. With a massive rise in literacy rates and increased access to print brought about by the\r\nprinting press, the reading population of the world shifted (Eisenstein 1983). While early\r\nreadership was restricted to a very small subset of society, the printing press paved the way for\r\nthe coverage of more mundane topics such as sports. In their analysis of sports media in pre-\r\nindustrial America, sports media scholars Jennings Bryant and Andrea Holt point to two major\r\ndevelopments: first, the appearance of sports in newspapers as 'general news' and second the\r\ncreation of a completely sports-centered publication: the sports magazine (2006, 22). The advent\r\nand success of sports magazines in the early nineteenth century stands as a marker for some of\r\nthe intellectual shifts of the industrial era. During this time we see a professionalization of sport\r\nin the form of prize fighters. We also see a shift from sports as a local leisure activity to\r\nsomething that one follows from a distance. Sports contests began to take on implications\r\nbeyond a mere matching of athletes.\r\nMany sports magazines started out as independent, one-person operations that began\r\ncirculation in the 1820s and 1830s (Bryant and Holt 2006, 22). The Spiritof the Times, one of the\r\nearliest iterations of the sports magazine, actually reached a circulation of over 100,000 readers\r\nby the 1840s. The success of this initial sports-focused publication displays the roots of the\r\nAmerican sports media tradition. While they note the significance of sports magazines in the\r\noverall climate of sports media in America, Bryant and Holt trace the advent of modem sports\r\n1See Elizabeth Eisenstein. 1983. The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe. New York: Cambridge University Press.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 25\r\nmedia to recaps of prize fighting in the Penny Press age of the 1830s. With increased circulation\r\nto the middle and lower classes, sports coverage increased substantially in the mid-nineteenth\r\ncentury. Sports coverage in the Penny Press era focused on creating spectacular depictions of\r\nsporting events. As McChesney, a media historian points out, James Gordon Bennett, owner of\r\nthe New York Herald,was \"one of the first exponents of 'sensationalism' as a means of\r\ngenerating circulation, and sport fit comfortably within this rubric\" (1989, 51) Out of the\r\nsensationalism present in these early newspapers, sports began to take on more significant\r\ncultural meaning.\r\nThere was particular focus on regionalism and nationalism. Sports media scholar J.\r\nEnriquez explains that sporting events were far more likely to be covered if they featured a\r\ncontest which reflected the social preoccupations of the day such as a northern horse racing\r\nagainst a southern horse, or an American boxer fighting a European (2002, 201). Through these\r\nmediated depictions, sporting events were encoded with much more meaning than a simple\r\ncontest. They reflected the contemporary hopes and anxieties of the people. Sports media built\r\nup athletes as representatives. Newspaper recaps did much more than simply describe the\r\nactions; they created dramas (McChesney 1989, 51). The hyped up imagery of athletes and their\r\ncontests created through the Penny Press and sports magazines became the paradigm for sports\r\ncoverage for decades while a new sport caught America's attention.\r\nNewspaper Sports Writing and the Rise of Team Sports\r\nThe rise of baseball as a national pastime coincide with the period of time just after the\r\nAmerican Civil War. McChesney explains, \"The Civil War introduced baseball to an entire\r\ngeneration of Americans, as the troops on both sides played the game when time permitted.\r\nIndeed, baseball emerged as the preeminent national team sport during this period\" (1989, 52).\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 26\r\nAfter the Civil War, baseball helped mediate conflict by providing common ground for\r\nnortherners and southerners. This moment was one in which the country was seeking to heal its\r\nrift, looking for neutral things that could bind the nation together. Baseball filled a political\r\nagenda by giving people something to focus on without opening old wounds. Sports writing\r\nchanged drastically in the years following baseball's spike in popularity. Sports coverage began\r\nto receive regular columns and increased coverage throughout the late nineteenth century,\r\nleading to a new kind of journalistic specialization: the sports-writer (Enriquez 2002, 202). This\r\nfixation on sport was a result of new socio-cultural environments. Mandelbaum (2004), a sports\r\nmedia scholar and historian, argues that the industrial revolution created a new sports landscape\r\nthrough several major developments. First, the notion of childhood had expanded. In the\r\nnineteenth century, the period between birth and entering the workforce increased substantially.\r\nThe new notion of childhood permitted more people to engage with baseball, football, and\r\nbasketball. This increased interest in team sports continued into adulthood. Watching and reading\r\nabout sports in the newspaper or sports magazines became an acceptable way to recapture the\r\n\"carefree years of their lives\" (Mandelbaum 2004, 2). Mandelbaum also argues that baseball\r\noffered a renewed connection to pastoral America, creating a feeling of nostalgia for the new city\r\ndwellers and factory workers who desperately missed the pace and beauty of rural America.\r\nBaseball coverage created the first major feedback loop between sports and media in\r\nAmerica. Bryant and Holt claim that the importance of sport was downplayed significantly in the\r\npuritan era, but, \"regular, routine reporting of sports in newspapers and specialized magazines\r\nhelped shift the cultural attitude towards sports in general\" (Bryant and Holt 2006, 25). They\r\nargue that in the late 1870s through the 1890s, Americans adopted a new stance on sports as\r\nimportant for the development of mind, body, and society. This new cultural stance on sports\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 27\r\nwas shaped and fostered by an increased media coverage of sports. As baseball and its media\r\ncoverage became more professionalized, Americans began to consume sports media in\r\ncompletely different methods. Sports spectatorship became a regular and acceptable pastime for\r\nthe industrial worker.\r\nThe industrial revolution created the first opportunity in America for sports production\r\nand spectatorship to be commercially successful endeavors. The growth of cities and the massive\r\ndevelopments in individual mobility allowed for sporting events to take on new significance\r\n(Mandelbaum 2004, 3). Cities provided large numbers of sports players as well as spectators to\r\nfill newly built stadiums and watch newly formed teams. Sports fandom in the U.S. fit neatly\r\ninto the predominant forms of labor and leisure. Zillmann and Paulus (1993), two psychologists\r\nwho wrote on sports spectatorship, explain, \"spectatorship, as a significant form of recreation, is\r\nan outgrowth of the monotony of machine-dictated labor, sports events became the weekend love\r\naffair of all those whose workday was strictly regulated by production schedules\" (601).\r\nZillmann and Paulus' article further supports the feedback between sports media consumption\r\nand societal structures. Live spectatorship in America had previously been seen as a luxury for\r\nthe rich and powerful, but with the increased circulation of newspapers, and in particular sports\r\ncoverage, to the middle and lower classes, sports spectatorship became accessible to an entirely\r\nnew sector of the population (Bryant and Holt 2006, 21). Architecture once again emerged as an\r\nimportant medium. Large concrete and steel stadiums were created, replacing the more\r\norganically created playing fields of the late nineteenth century (Mandelbaum 2004, 52). We see\r\nhere an important transition into the production of sport as a money making opportunity. As I\r\ndiscuss in the third chapter, the introduction of investors and producers fundamentally alters\r\nsports and their media counterparts.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 28\r\nThe available media shaped the portrayal and perception of athletics in the industrial era\r\nas well. The idea may sound a bit romantic, but Benjamin Rader (1984), a sports scholar focused\r\non the transformation of sports media in America, labels the period of sports media prior to\r\ntelevision as an era of heroes. Whether speaking of prize-fighters or the Mighty Casey of\r\nfolklore, sports media in the industrial era painted athletes as larger-than-life characters. Rader\r\nclaims, \"[t]hose standing on the assembly lines and those sitting at their desks in the\r\nbureaucracies increasingly found their greatest satisfaction in the athletic hero, who presented an\r\nimage of all-conquering power\" (1989, 16). To Rader, sports media before television presented\r\nthe American ideal. Athletes were meritocratic role-models playing for the love of the game.\r\nRader's analysis places the impetus on newspapers to depict dramatic stories with characters\r\nakin to David and Goliath.\r\nIn addition to individual mobility, urbanization, and industrial work, Enriquez attributes\r\nthe rise and legitimacy of sports journalism as the catalyst for the nationalization of sports in\r\nAmerica (2002, 201). As all forms of communication and nationalization were transforming,\r\nsports coverage lead the charge. In the early twentieth century, most newspapers had dedicated\r\nsports writers on staff. These sports writers became famous through their innovative and\r\nentrancing writing. Writers like W. 0. McGeehan, who worked for many San Francisco papers,\r\ndescribed athletes as sorrowful sages and their contests as the clashing of titans on a battlefield\r\n(Nyhistory.org 2015). In this period however, it is difficult to judge the difference between\r\njournalism and public relations (Bryant and Holt 2006, 30). In fact, the issue of PR penetrating\r\njournalism in the late nineteenth to early twentieth century is explicitly laid out in Michael\r\nSchudson's (1981) chapter, \"Stories and Information: Two Journalisms in the 1890s\". At the turn\r\nof the century, there existed a dichotomy between news as entertainment and news as\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 29\r\ninformation. As papers around the country struggled to define themselves, sports media also\r\nwent through a defining period. Legitimate sports writing became known for its higher literary\r\nquality, but read more like advertisements with its exaggerated, often hyperbolic, language.\r\nPublic relations soon became as much a part of sports journalism as describing the events\r\nthemselves. Team owners understood the media's role in keeping attendance at sporting events\r\nup and began catering to sports journalists for coverage (Enriquez 2002, 206). The team owners\r\nexpected sports journalists to act as publicists for their events. The gambit paid off as sports\r\nwriting filled more and more of the daily papers and attendance at live events continued to rise.\r\nThe sports writers added significance to the experience of watching a sporting event. Between\r\nthe shifts in the American middle class, leisure activities, and the flowery language of sports\r\njournalism, watching a sporting event began to take on the significance of watching history\r\nunfold. We will see these same issues appear again in e-sports coverage as journalism becomes a\r\nlegitimizing force within the e-sports landscape, torn between deep analysis and hyped-up\r\ndepictions for the sake of generating publicity.\r\nLiveness continued to assert its role in sports media as new technologies emerged. The\r\ntelegraph especially placed the impetus on news sources to provide timely information. In a\r\nfascinating illustration of the desire for timely sports news, the ChicagoTribuneran the\r\nfollowing note on March 17, 1897, the day of the legendary boxing match between Jim Corbett\r\nand Rob Fitzsimmons: \"The Tribune will display bulletins today on the prize fight. It has secured\r\na telegraph wire to the ring in Carson City and a competent man will describe the progress of the\r\nfight, blow by blow, until the test is decided. The bulletins will be posted thirty seconds after\r\nthey are written in the far Western city\" (Bryant and Holt 2006, 29). This fixation on live updates\r\nfor sporting events across the nation is another example of how sports media has shaped the\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 30\r\nmedia landscape of America. Information began traveling faster than ever via wireless\r\ntransmissions, but it was actually a yacht race which saw one of the very first implementations of\r\nwireless for live information transmission. Sporting events saw some of the earliest uses of the\r\ntelegraph for news reporting as well (Mott 1950, 597). As the telegraph allowed for a sense of\r\nliveness even for remote events, it paved the way for the most significant development in sports\r\nmedia prior to television: radio.\r\nA Fixation on Liveness: Radio and Sports Consumption\r\nRadio delivered on the push towards liveness established by the telegraph. The first\r\nbroadcast of a Major League Baseball game occurred within a year of the commercial release of\r\nradio (Enriquez 2002, 206). Rader remarks, \"Now the fan did not have to await his morning\r\nnewspaper; he instantly shared the drama transpiring on the playing field\" (Rader 1984, 23). For\r\nthe first time, sports were perceived as home entertainment. Broadcasters as well as businesses\r\ncapitalized on the shift. Sports coverage was integral to the rise in popularity of radio in the\r\ninterwar period. In Rader's words,\r\nIn the pre-television era, the heroes of sports assisted the public in coping with a rapidly changing society. The sports world made it possible for Americans to continue to believe in the traditional gospel of success: that hard work, frugality, and loyalty paid dividends; that the individual was potent and could play a large role in shaping his own destiny (1984, 15).\r\nBy Rader's account, sports programming on radio delivered a much needed revitalization\r\nof the American ideals through the transient industrial period and The Great Depression.\r\nThe rise of radio coincides with the golden age of baseball, but there was an awkward\r\ntransitional phase into the new medium while newspapers and radio both tried to define their\r\nnew boundaries. While consumers clearly desired liveness, initial radio broadcasts felt flat and\r\nemotionless (Bryant and Holt 2006, 27). Some of the greatest blow-by-blow sports writers were\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 31\r\nterrible at delivering a compelling radio broadcast. Sports writers were extremely adept at\r\ncreating dramas through print, but they failed to capture audiences in the early days of radio.\r\nOddly enough, their sports knowledge undermined their sports coverage in the new medium.\r\nInstead, a new role emerged: the sportscaster.\r\nIn the era of radio, the performance of live sports broadcasts came with significant stakes.\r\nAdept sportscasters were cherished more for their voices than their sports knowledge. Delivering\r\nplay-by-play depictions of sporting events takes little technical knowledge, instead the\r\nentertainment comes from the delivery. Mandelbaum writes of early radio sportscasters, \"the\r\nbroadcasters were akin to poets and troubadours who preserved and handed down the great tales\r\noftheir cultures by committing them to memory and reciting them publicly\" (2004, 80). Delivery\r\nwas actually so important that sometimes sportscasters such as Graham McNamee, known\r\nespecially for his baseball broadcasts, were not even present at the event but instead handed\r\nwritten play-by-play depictions of the game so that they could add their own dramatic and\r\nauthorial tone to the live event (Mandelbaum 2004).\r\nAnother issue during the emergence of radio was redefining the role of newspaper sports\r\ncoverage. Radio could deliver the liveness desired by sports fans and was incredibly well suited\r\nfor play-by-play commentary. Newspapers had traditionally covered the blow-by-blow report of\r\nan event, capturing the drama through flowery language and hyperbole. With radio, the\r\nsportscaster captured the audience's attention through the same means, bringing in even more\r\nemotion as his voice rose and fell with the action of the contest (Enriquez 2002, 202). Sports\r\nwriters instead decided to focus on an area that radio broadcasters could not: strategy. Early\r\nsportscasters had to focus so much on the delivery of the action that they could not elaborate on\r\nthe reasons behind certain maneuvers. Sports writers took advantage of this deficiency and began\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 32\r\nwriting articles which focused on everything around the action. From in-depth analysis of\r\nstrategy to the creation of larger than life athlete personalities, newspaper coverage of sports in\r\nthe era of radio completely changed to remain relevant.\r\nSports magazines also had to find a new space to occupy during radio's reign.\r\nCompletely unable to keep up with the live coverage by radio and the strategic coverage of\r\nAmerica's favorite sport, baseball, sports magazines instead began to focus on niche sports such\r\nas yacht racing. The other innovation of sports magazines in the early 1930s was their addition of\r\nfull page color photographs of athletes, something that neither radio nor newspapers could offer\r\n(Enriquez 2002, 202). They remained as an important sports medium but had been supplanted by\r\nboth radio and newspapers. Baseball's hold on the American public was so strong that the niche\r\nsports, which were typically covered in sports magazines, hardly seemed relevant. Football in\r\nparticular rarely saw coverage anywhere other than sports magazines (Bryant and Holt 2006, 32).\r\nFootball had traditionally been seen as a college sport reserved for the wealthy, but with an\r\nincreasing number of college graduates in the U.S. and the rise of a new medium, its niche status\r\nwas about to change (Oriard 2014, vii).\r\nThe Televisual Transformation of Sport\r\nTelevision's initial debut into the sports world was a colossal failure. Reaching only a\r\nfew hundred people, the first American televisual sports broadcast was a Columbia-Princeton\r\nbaseball game on May 17, 1939. Just a few years after the commercial release of the television in\r\nthe U.S., RCA's first foray into televised sport flopped. The New York Times' Orrin E. Dunlap Jr.\r\nrecounted on the following Sunday, \"The televiewer lacks freedom; seeing baseball on television\r\nis too confining, for the novelty would not hold up for more than an hour if it were not for the\r\ncommentator\" (Rader 1984, 17). He goes on to say, \"To see the fresh green of the field as The\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 33\r\nMighty Casey advances to the bat, and the dust fly as he defiantly digs in, is a thrill to the eye\r\nthat cannot be electrified and flashed through space on a May day, no matter how clear the air.\"\r\nBryant, Holt, Enriquez, and Rader attribute the failure of early televisual sports to several\r\nfactors. First, television camera technology was rudimentary and receivers were even worse\r\n(Bryant and Holt 2006, 31; Rader 1984, 18). Viewers could hardly see the player, much less\r\nfollow the ball or action on the field. Second, television was not a commercial success upon its\r\nrelease. Sets were expensive and did not offer nearly enough programming to warrant their price:\r\nan issue that created a sort of negative loop as the television industry needed more viewers to\r\nwarrant more content yet could not supply enough content to attract more viewers. The third\r\nfactor, described by Enriquez, is the failure for broadcasters to adapt to the new medium.\r\nSportscasters could not actually see the video feed and casted the game as if they were still on\r\nradio; recounting every single action that occurred on the field despite what was on viewers'\r\nscreens at home. Inexperienced camera operators had difficulty following the action and the\r\nimage rarely matched what the sportscaster was describing.\r\nRadio sportscasters also had difficulty transitioning into the new visual medium because\r\nthey could no longer provide the same level of drama through exaggeration and hyperbole.\r\nWhere short infield ground balls could previously be described as laser-fast bullets, the viewers\r\nat home now saw that the play was just another ordinary event. Situated somewhere in between\r\nwatching the game live at a stadium yet still sounding like radio, televisual sport had a difficult\r\ntime defining itself in the late 1930s and early 1940s. According to Rader, televisual sport\r\nexperimentation stopped completely during the Second World War (1984, 23).\r\nWith the well-established roles of radio, newspapers, and sports magazines, the revival of\r\ntelevisual sport seemed to be impossible. The utter failure of televised sports in the late 1930s\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 34\r\ninto the Second World War left televisual sport in a difficult position. Sports radio's popularity\r\nwas at an all-time high in the 1940s. Baseball had captured the hearts and minds of the American\r\npeople, and famous radio broadcasters such as Bill Stern and Jack Armstrong kept them listening\r\nwith bated breath (Rader 1984, 30-3 1).\r\nBaseball and more generally live event sports spectatorship, however, could not keep the\r\nnation content for too long. In what has been dubbed the Sports Slump of the 1950s by Rader\r\nand others (Bryant and Holt 2006, McChesney 1989), spectatorship had finally started to\r\ndwindle. Television sets were making their way into homes in record numbers after World War\r\n11. In the post-World War 11 era, pastimes shifted from inner-city, public forms of recreation to\r\nprivate, home-centered forms of recreation. Sports revenue was down and change was in the air.\r\nPeople could watch baseball on their television sets at home, but not many people wanted\r\nto. As shown by the earlier quote from The New York Times, television had difficulty containing\r\nthe magic that baseball once held. Football, however, was poised to rise with the new medium. It\r\nhad been long overlooked, but football was incredibly well suited for television broadcasts. The\r\nlarge, visually distinct ball and typically slow moving action provided an acceptable subject for\r\ncontemporary television camera technology (Grano 2014, 13). College football had seen a bit of\r\nsuccess in newspapers, but professional football had a negative reputation as a \"perversion ofthe\r\ncollege game played for alma mater rather than a lousy paycheck\" (Oriard 2014, vii). Radio\r\nbroadcasts of football had never reached the same level of success as baseball.\r\nProfessional football seemed to be a sport without a suitable medium. As sports media\r\nscholar Michael Oriard explains, \"[o]nly television could give the professional game a national\r\naudience, and Pete Rozelle's defining act as the commissioner who ushered in the modem NFL\r\nwas to market the league through a single television contract, rather than leaving clubs to work\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 35\r\nout their own deals\" (2014, vii). This deal with broadcasting giant, NBC, led to the NFL's great\r\nbreakout story and what would soon become the model for televised sports (Rader 1984, 85).\r\nWith the NBC still losing money on a dwindling sports fanbase, they were ready to pull the plug\r\non their deal with the budding NFL until the championship match between the Baltimore Colts\r\nand the New York Giants of 1958 (Grano 2014, 13). This match, still hailed as the 'Greatest\r\nGame Ever Played', would become the longstanding origin story of televised football. The game\r\nwent into a second overtime, pushing the broadcast into prime time on the East Coast, a slot in\r\nwhich NBC never dared to place professional football. As millions of Americans tuned in for\r\ntheir regularly scheduled programming, they instead found John Unitas and his Baltimore Colts\r\nscoring the game winning touchdown after a long, hard-fought battle. Oriard, Rader, Grano,\r\nOates, and Furness all trace the NFL's commercial success to this one defining moment.\r\nAs compelling as origin stories often are, the truth is that many other factors lead to the\r\nsuccess of football in the new mass medium. New technologies such as video tape were integral\r\nto the rise of football in America. Hitchcock argues that instant replay in particular helped with\r\nthe rebranding of professional football: \"The use of video-tape gave the game of football a whole\r\nnew image... The instant replay changed football from brutal, quick collisions into graceful\r\nleaps, tumbles and falls. It gave football an aura of art in movement. It made football attractive to\r\nentirely new segments of the audience\" (1989, 2). Where football players had once been seen as\r\nlethargic brutes, instant replay allowed broadcasters to slow down images, dissect plays, and\r\nhighlight the athleticism of players (Rader 1984, 83-84).\r\nSports, with football leading the charge, were once again on the cutting edge of media\r\nadoption. According to Dylan Mulvin, the first documented use of instant replay for review and\r\ntraining purposes was in 1957 during a game between the Los Angeles Rams and the San\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 36\r\nFrancisco 49ers (2014, 49). By 1964, instant replay was a standard broadcasting technique across\r\nall sports. The NFL's willingness to adapt to the new medium set it apart from other sports at the\r\ntime.\r\nIn addition to these technological and legal advances, Bryant and Holt as well as\r\nMcChesney argue that one particularly innovative producer reinvented sports broadcasting for\r\ntelevision: Roone Arledge. With ABC's full support, Arledge established television broadcasting\r\nconventions still present today. After the 1958 Championship game between the Colts and the\r\nGiants, ABC was scrambling to catch up to the NBC's success in televised sports broadcasting.\r\nAs Enriquez describes, \"Television broadcasting affected different sports in different ways. It\r\ndevastated boxing, had mixed effects on baseball, and proved a boon to college and professional\r\nfootball\" (2002, 202). As NBC began to ride the wave created by the NFL, ABC looked to get in\r\non the action.\r\nArledge was given free rein to perform a complete overhaul of ABC Sports. Bryant and\r\nHolt argue that the single most important innovation Arledge brought was the notion that a\r\ntelevisual broadcast should be presented \"from the perspective of what the typical fan would see\r\nif he or she attended the game live\" (Bryant and Holt 2006, 33). Arledge (2003) believed that the\r\nbroadcast should capture the essence of attending a game, not just the play on the field, but the\r\nroar of the crowd, the cheerleaders, the marching bands, and the coaches on the sidelines. As\r\nEnriquez describes, \"under Arledge, television assumed every role previously played by print\r\nmedia; it served as the primary medium for experiencing events, it provided detailed analysis,\r\nand it gave human faces to the participants\" (2002, 205). Through football, televised sports were\r\nable to set conventions which separated them from earlier forms of media. This transition lives\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 37\r\non in live-streaming today as we will see later with live-streaming's adaptation rather than\r\ntransformation of televised sport.\r\nThe arrival of television meant that sports radio and print media had to redefine their role\r\nin sports coverage. Television could deliver the liveness of radio and, with the help of\r\ncommentators and technology like instant replay, the drama and dissection of strategy found in\r\nprint media. Newspaper coverage of sports was now relegated to simple recaps. Sports\r\nmagazines on the other hand rode the success of television. As Bryant and Holt assert, \"Sports\r\nIllustratedoffers a classic example of an old medium responding to a new one\" (2006, 36).\r\nRather than seeking out an area left uncovered by television, Sports Illustratedsupported\r\ntelevised sports by providing innovative action photography and updates on the most popular\r\nathletes and teams at the time.\r\nSports broadcasts of the 1960s were infused with the hopes and fears of the Cold War\r\nera. R. Powers, a television sports scholar, suggests that sports filled a void in the American\r\npublic, \"shrugging off the darker morbidities of the Cold War and McCarthyism\" (1984, 118).\r\nThe re-found focus on sports as spectacle established by \"the youthful theme of ABC, echoed the\r\nKennedy idealism of the new frontier, the sporting emphasis echoed Kennedy's image of\r\nmuscular athleticism...\" (Whannel 2002, 34). Entertainment sports media, with its art-in-motion\r\npresentation, delivered a message of newness and regeneration to American.\r\nThrough broadcasting and advertising deals, sports helped build and perpetuate the\r\ngrowing conspicuous consumption movement and the capitalist ideals of post-war America.\r\nAthletes resumed their star status. Sports stars began appearing in advertising everywhere.\r\nMerchandising became a key part of sports promotion. Anything from replica jerseys of sports\r\nstars to blankets and flags with team branding can be found almost anywhere in the U.S.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 38\r\nContemporary Sports fandom has come to mean much more than simply following a team. It\r\nmeans buying a team's products, playing sports video games, joining fantasy leagues, and\r\nwatching sports entertainment television. Oates, a sports media scholar focused on the NFL,\r\nwrites that fandom has been transformed by the presentation of athletes as commodities to be\r\nconsumed selectively and self-consciously by sports fans (2014, 80). The previously subcultural\r\nhyper-fandom activities such as fantasy football and sports video games, Oates argues, have\r\nmoved into mainstream prominence and profitability. Fans are invited to interact with athletes as\r\nvicarious managers in fantasy sports, offering a completely new, personally tailored form of\r\ninteraction with sports organizations. This new drive for constant connection and feedback\r\nwithin the sports industry culminates with live-streaming.\r\nLive-Streaming: Constant Connection\r\nAs Oates suggests, sports fandom has fundamentally changed to reflect an increased\r\ninvolvement on the part of the spectator. Athletes and personalities have become commodities\r\nfor fans to interact with. Social media, fantasy sports, and video games have created a connection\r\nto sports stars that was never before available in other media. At any moment, a spectator can\r\ncatch highlights on ESPN, head over to forums to discuss major sporting events, or load a stream\r\nof a match on their phone, all while tweeting at their favorite athletes with the expectation that\r\ntheir words will be received on the other end.\r\nRecent trends show a change in the sports media landscape as new platforms begin to vie\r\nfor control over sports broadcasting in the US. The NFL has recently signed a deal with Google\r\nallowing for the streaming of games over the internet after their current contract with DirecTV\r\nends in 2015. This deal reflects the changing media landscape in the internet era. The rise of new\r\nstreaming platforms poses an interesting dilemma to the current media titans and new\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 39\r\nopportunities for new forms of media sports. Thus far, using the tradition established by\r\nMcChesney, Bryant, Holt, and Rader among others, I have used sports media as a lens through\r\nwhich to view particular socio-cultural moments in America. I now turn that lens towards the\r\ncontemporary sports media landscape. What can we learn about our own social moment by\r\nlooking at the use of streaming platforms for traditional sports or the arrival of e-sports as an\r\nentirely new form of professional competition that makes use of older forms of media, but\r\nthrives in live-streams and video on demand?\r\nThe MLB offers an early case study into the use of live-streaming for major league sports\r\nbroadcasting. The regular season in the MLB consists of 2,430 games, a staggering number\r\ncompared to the NFL's 256. The sheer number of regular season games held each year causes a\r\nproblem with over-saturation. This inundation of content lowers the value of each individual\r\ngame in the eyes of the major networks (Mondelo 2006, 283). The games that these networks\r\nchoose not to air due to scheduling conflicts previously caused many games to go unseen by fans\r\noutside of the local media market for the two competing teams. To remedy the situation, the\r\nMLB streamed over 1,000 regular season games online starting in 2003. The launch of MLB.tv\r\nin 2002 allowed engaged MLB fans to continue watching content even when they did not have\r\naccess to the games through the major networks. While not initially a huge commercial success,\r\nMLB.tv still runs today, over a decade later at a monthly subscription of $19.99 and as of 2014\r\nincorporated both post-season games and the World Series as part of the package (MLB.tv\r\n2015). While the MLB has not released the official revenue totals for its live-streaming service,\r\nwith 3.7 million subscribers the platform generates well over $400 million per year (MLB.tv\r\n2013). This little-known use of live-streaming shows a hunger for immediate interaction with\r\nsports media regardless of the available medium.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 40\r\nEarly live-streaming fundamentally looks and feels like television, but it filled a role\r\nwhich network television could not: all access and constant connection to media. It took form on\r\na new platform, but did not truly differ from television. Early live-streaming is more like an\r\nadaptation of television than a new medium. Rather than creating something new, the early foray\r\ninto live-streaming by the MLB simply adapted the already present broadcasting infrastructure\r\nand applied it through a different avenue. Television is often invoked in live-streaming. If we\r\nlook at MLB.tv, the .tv signifies its connection to television, but that domain is actually the\r\nofficial domain for the country of Tuvalu. Other streaming platforms like ustream.tv, twitch.tv,\r\nMLG.tv, all based outside of Tuvalu, use the same domain to signal their televisual connection.\r\nLive-streaming emerged at a very particular moment in the evolution of sports media.\r\nWith air-time limited on the major networks, the internet allows a near infinite amount of content\r\nto reach sports fans. As Oates would argue, from fantasy sports, to blogs, to live-streaming, the\r\ninternet is, for many, the new space of the sports fan. Live-streaming goes beyond the ability of\r\nother media to reach viewers wherever and whenever, whether from a home computer or a\r\nmobile device. Live-streaming delivers on the constant connectedness expected by consumers\r\ntoday. At its roots, live-streaming is a televisual medium. So what separates it from television?\r\nLive-streaming today has created its own niche by blending other forms of media. Most\r\nlive-streams host an internet relay chat (IRC) in addition to the audiovisual component of the\r\nbroadcast. This IRC allows viewers to chat with other audience members and often the\r\nbroadcaster, a functionality not currently available in television. This live audience connection in\r\nlive-streaming is unparalleled in television. Hamilton et al., in their investigation of the\r\nsignificance of live-streaming for community creation, situate Twitch streams as an important\r\n'third place' for community. Building on the work of both Oldenberg and McLuhan, Hamilton et\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 41\r\nal. (2014) suggest that \"By combining hot and cool media, streams enable the sharing of rich\r\nephemeral experiences in tandem with open participation through informal social interaction, the\r\ningredients for a third place.\" The third place that the authors point to creates a rich connection\r\nakin to interpersonal interaction. The ephemeral nature of these interactions creates a deep sense\r\nof community even in streams with hundreds of thousands of viewers. Live-streaming and in\r\nturn, the IRC associated with streams creates a shared experience tantamount to the \"roar of a\r\nstadium\" (Hamilton et al. 2014). These streams also pull in a global audience, connecting\r\nisolated audiences into one hyper-connected community. Live-streaming draws on television for\r\nits look and feel, but delivers not only on the desire for liveness perpetuated in sports media but\r\nalso the hyper-connectivity present in today's globalized world.\r\nE-sports, Live-streaming, and Sports Media\r\nMany factors contributed to the success of live-streaming for e-sports. It arrived at a\r\nmoment when television seemed closed to e-sports, it was much less expensive to produce, and\r\nmuch easier to cultivate. Television broadcasts are prohibitively expensive to produce. Early\r\nattempts at airing e-sports on television have typically flopped, rarely surviving past a second\r\nseason. E-sports are difficult to film when compared to traditional sports and conventions had\r\nnot yet been set for the televisual presentation of e-sports (Taylor 2012). The action in traditional\r\nsports can typically be captured by one shot. E-sports broadcasts, in contrast, must synthesize\r\none cohesive narrative out many different player viewpoints with varying levels of information.\r\nIn a game like CounterStrike, broadcasters must wrangle with a large map with ten players in\r\nfirst-person perspective. The resulting audiovisual feed is a frantic attempt to capture the most\r\nrelevant information from the players with an outside 'observer' controlling another viewpoint\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 42\r\nremoved from the players' point of view. The observer functionality in the early days of e-sports\r\nbroadcasting created a difficult barrier to overcome for commercial success on television.\r\nObserver functionality had not yet become a focus for game developers and commentary had not\r\nreached the level of competency it has in more contemporary broadcasts.\r\nInstead of finding success on television, e-sports pulls in millions of concurrent viewers\r\non live-streaming sites such as Twitch.tv. With television seemingly out of reach and streaming\r\nrequiring significant investment per event in the early 2000's, e-sports broadcasting remained\r\nrelatively stagnant until the arrival of a reliable, and cheap, live-streaming platform. Justin.tv\r\n(and other similar sites like UStream and Stickam), which launched in 2007, delivered exactly\r\nwhat e-sports broadcasters needed to grow. The site allowed users to quickly and easily stream\r\ncontent online with the use of some relatively simple software. Both broadband internet reach\r\nand streaming technology had developed to a point that lowered the barrier of entry for\r\nbroadcasters. Players from around the world streamed games from their bedrooms. E-sports\r\nbroadcasters reached new, massive audiences.\r\nThe success of gaming content on Justin.tv spurred a new streaming site dedicated solely\r\nto gaming. The games-centered streaming site, Twitch.tv, launched in 2011. Twitch.tv\r\nrevolutionized the e-sports industry. Each of the casters I interviewed spent time detailing the\r\nimportance of Twitch.tv without being prompted. As one explained, Twitch.tv is \"the clearest\r\ndriving factor that's grown e-sports over the past 2-3 years.\" As mentioned in the introduction, e-\r\nsports audiences have reached previously unheard of levels. Large scale e-sports events regularly\r\nsee concurrent viewer numbers in the hundreds of thousands. These broadcasts still largely\r\nresemble televised sports however, rarely, if ever, making use of the IRC.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n43\r\nLive-streaming is just one of the forms of media the e-sports industry makes use of. In\r\nfact, e-sports interacts with most media in the same ways that traditional sports have. The e-\r\nsports industry pushes back into almost all of the earlier forms of media discussed in this chapter.\r\nPrint and radio typically fill a PR role in e-sports coverage. Large events or developments often\r\nmake their way into publications like The New York Times. Local radio segments will\r\noccasionally feature summaries of e-sports events occurring nearby. Internet versions of both of\r\nprint and radio sports coverage are fundamental segments of the e-sports media ecosystem.\r\nPodcasts, digital audio files available on the internet through downloads or streaming, vlogs, and\r\nvideo diaries fill essentially the same role for e-sports that radio currently plays for traditional\r\nsports. Experts weigh in on recent developments and players breakdown certain aspects of a\r\ngame.\r\nE-sports journalism has also immerged as a legitimizing force within the industry. Sites\r\nlike ongamers.com and esportsheaven.com keep fans abreast of any new developments in the\r\nprofessional scene for all of the major e-sports titles. Journalists like Richard Lewis add\r\nlegitimacy to e-sports through their coverage of current events. Their recaps of developments as\r\nwell as summaries of various tournaments and leagues closely resemble their print counterparts\r\nin sports coverage. It is clear that the e-sports industry is in conversation with many forms of\r\nmedia. Many of the forms and techniques are borrowed directly from sports coverage. These\r\nforms of media did not appear instantly however, they are the result of years of push and pull\r\nwith the larger sports media landscape. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the commentating\r\nof e-sports live-streams.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n44\r\nChapter 2\r\nShoutcasters Collecting Conventions\r\nE-sportscasters, often referred to as shoutcasters, both look and sound like professional\r\nsportscasters. Their attire and cadence both create an instant connection to televisual sports.\r\nHaving never seen a game of Starcraft 2 before, you may watch the flashing lights and\r\nexplosions with a perplexed look on your face. As you continue to watch, you hear two\r\ncommentators provide a narrative, stats fly across the screen, and you start to piece together the\r\ngame in front of you. After a few minutes, you know the two players who are facing off against\r\none another, you feel the excitement as they engage each other's armies, and a slight sting as the\r\nplayer you were rooting for concedes the match with a polite \"GG.\" The whole presentation feels\r\nlike a variant of Monday Night Football with virtual armies instead of football teams. From the\r\nstat-tickers to the sound of the commentator's voice, you can almost imagine the ESPN or CBS\r\nlogo gracing the bottom corner of the screen. Shoutcasters have become a staple in e-sports. One\r\nof the main signifiers of the 'sports' moniker professional gaming has taken on, shoutcasters lend\r\nan air of professionalism to a scene which often struggles to define itself. By adopting the 'sport'\r\ntitle, a precedent has been set for e-sports broadcasters which informs their style and\r\nconventions.\r\nShoutcasters are important to investigate because they form a fundamental grounding for\r\ne-sports which helps it to create its identity in the face of blistering turnover rates and constant\r\nfield shifts. E-sports stand in a unique position compared to traditional sports. Where players and\r\ncoaches in traditional sports often have careers that last for several years, e-sports personalities\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 45\r\nsuffer from intense turnover rates where professional careers can end within a year. E-sports\r\nplayers burn out quickly and coaches rarely make a lasting name in the industry. The\r\nrecognizable personalities in e-sports are the few innovators and commentators who turned their\r\npassion into a career. In this chapter, I analyze the role of shoutcasters within the larger\r\nframework of the e-sports industry. I build much of this analysis on the foundation that Taylor\r\n(2012) established in her investigation of the rise of e-sports. Much of Taylor's analysis still\r\nholds true today, but some other developments in the field have created new dynamics within\r\nshoutcasting that were not present during her initial encounters with shoutcasters. Understanding\r\nhow shoutcasters borrow from earlier forms of media, the issues they perceive within the\r\nindustry, and how they cultivate their own identity as shoutcasters while grappling with the\r\nhyper-connection found in live-streaming as a medium allows us to grasp the relationship e-\r\nsports broadcasting has with earlier forms of media while still creating its own identity. I begin\r\nwith a very brief look at the history of shoutcasting.\r\nShoutcasting History\r\nOne can see that even early attempts at broadcasting competitive gaming borrowed\r\nheavily from its media contemporaries. Starcade,a 1982 show that ran for two years, marks one\r\nof the first forays into e-sports broadcasting. Though the term e-sports had not yet emerged, the\r\nshow featured two opponents attempting to outscore each other on various arcade machines. If\r\nwe look to Starcade as an early example of e-sports, then the origins of e-sports commentating\r\nresemble game show commentary found in Jeapordy! or The Price is Right. Watching Starcade\r\nfor the hosting alone reveals many similarities to other game shows: the host wears typical game-\r\nshow host garb, pleasantly explains every aspect of the competition, and speaks with the\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 46\r\nbroadcast voice we all recognize. Starcadealso shows the constant evolution of competitive\r\ngaming coverage as it continued to refine its camera angles, presentation, and format over its two\r\nyear run.\r\nThe model which more closely resembles our modern vision of shoutcasting gained\r\nmomentum at the turn of the twenty-first century. The title shoutcaster comes from the early\r\nstreaming software used for e-sports broadcasting, SHOUTcast. While many people familiar\r\nwith e-sports may have no idea where the term comes from, a prominent shoutcaster, djWHEAT\r\n(2012), claims that the title remains due to its signaling of the history of e-sports. SHOUTcast, a\r\nmedia streaming program, arrived in 1998, allowing interested parties to broadcast audio\r\nrecordings to various 'radio' channels for free. SHOUTcast allowed for video streaming, but as\r\none early shoutcaster I interviewed lamented, the bandwidth and equipment required for video\r\nstreaming was prohibitively expensive.\r\nInstead of the audiovisual broadcast we regularly associate with e-sports live-streams\r\ntoday, early shoutcasters relied on audio recordings akin to early radio coverage of traditional\r\nsports. These early broadcasts only streamed audio to a few hundred dedicated fans on internet\r\nradio. Early shoutcasts follow the form of traditional play-by-play radio broadcasts, focused\r\nprimarily on presenting every development in the game. In interviews, veteran shoutcasters were\r\nnot shy about admitting the influence radio sportscasters had on their own style. One mentioned\r\nthat he spent hours listening to live sports radio to hone his own skills.\r\nEarly shoutcasters also performed many aspects of the production that they are no longer\r\nrequired to perform in the more mature e-sports industry. They would attend events, set up their\r\nown station, typically with their own laptop and microphone. It was a very grassroots affair.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 47\r\nWith little experience in the technical aspects of broadcasting, the productions emulated as much\r\nas they could from sports broadcasting to lend an air of professionalism.\r\nWith the arrival of Twitch.tv, and other reliable streaming platforms, much of the onus of\r\nproduction was taken off of shoutcasters. Instead of acting as producers, directors, editors, and\r\non-air talent all at once as they had in the early audio-only streams, shoutcasters are now more\r\nable to focus on the portion of their work from which they get their name. Shoutcasting after the\r\nearly days of internet radio has come to not only sound like traditional sportscasting, but also\r\nlook like traditional sportscasting.\r\nSomething Borrowed: Influences from Sportscasting\r\nWardrobe\r\nMany ofthe shoutcasters I interviewed talked about wardrobe as a huge change within\r\nshoutcasting, one that was spurred entirely by looking at traditional sportscasting. Most\r\nshoutcasters got their start wearing t-shirts and jeans at various e-sports events. Today, you will\r\nrarely find a shoutcaster not wearing a shirt with a blazer. Looking at the image below shows the\r\nincredible shift in shoutcasting just within the last six years. Both images feature the same\r\nFigure 2-Left: Joe Miller at 2009 Intel Friday Game London; Right: Joe Miller at 2015 Intel Extreme Masters World Championship in Katowice Poland. Image credit: ESL, Philip Soedler and Helena Kristiansson. Flickr.com/eslphotos\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n48\r\nshoutcaster: Joe Miller. The left-hand image comes from the 2009 Intel Friday Game London\r\nwhile the right-hand image comes from the 2015 Intel Extreme Masters World Championship.\r\nWhile the images are quite similar, the professionalism apparent in the right-hand image\r\nresembles a professional sportscaster. The gamer/geek vibe found in the left-hand image has\r\nbeen removed from the shoutcasting image. As a few of the shoutcasters I spoke with admitted,\r\nthe drive to rework the shoutcaster wardrobe came purely from traditional sports. On top of that,\r\nthey pointed to a desire to shed the gamer/geek stereotypes that e-sports had come to inhabit. By\r\nadopting professional attire, they felt that they could get rid of the old image and emulate the\r\nprofessionalism of a sports broadcast. Wardrobe is not the only aspect of traditional sportscasting\r\nthat has made its way into shoutcasting.\r\nStyle\r\nOne of the more elusive aspects borrowed from traditional sports is the actual\r\ncommentary style. I use the term elusive here to signal the difficulty in pinning down exactly\r\nwhy shoutcasters remind us so vividly of traditional sportscasters. Early shoutcasters had no\r\nmodels outside of traditional sportscasting so they took as much as they could: \"So as a\r\nbroadcaster we look at traditional sportscasting. We pull from that and then make sure it fits in\r\ngame casting.\" As it turns out, many sports commentary conventions translate well into game\r\ncasting. As such, the first generation of casters share many similarities with television\r\nsportscasters. Most of these early shoutcasters admit to being influenced almost entirely by\r\ntraditional sportscasters. One caster explains, \"Television is where we grew up, it's what we\r\nwatched. So clearly that's where we're going to pull from.\"\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n49\r\nShoutcasters typically have no media training, instead relying on mimicry of earlier\r\nconventions to get by. As with most positions in e-sports, and similar to early sports writers and\r\nradio casters, shoutcasters are just passionate fans turned professional. In conversations, they\r\neach revealed a bit of their own personal history that pushed them towards broadcasting, but only\r\none ever mentioned having received any sort of formal training. Years into his shoutcasting\r\ncareer, he \"went back and did a journalism and broadcasting course for 6-9 months.\" Of\r\nparticular note, he mentions, \"they did one really good project which was 'how to be a news\r\npresenter'. They taught me the basics of that.\" The rest, he says, he learned on-air through\r\nexperience. The other shoutcasters I interviewed echoed this story.\r\nMost of the shoutcasters I interviewed fell into shoutcasting through happenstance and\r\nhad to learn their craft on-air. Shoutcasters are akin to the very early television sportscasters who\r\nhad to reinvent their style during broadcasts like Bob Stanton, a radio sportscaster turned\r\ntelevision sportscaster who would send his friends to sports bars to gather feedback and\r\nsuggestions from audience members (Rader 1984). Echoing this inexperience and improvisation,\r\none shoutcaster I interviewed confided, \"the first time I had ever been on camera, I sat down and\r\nI was like, 'I have no idea how to do this.' I had done two and a half years of audio casting, but I\r\nhad never done video.\" Another caster recalls of his first show, \"All I knew going into my first\r\nbroadcast was that I know this game. I know how it works, I know these players, and I play\r\nagainst these kinds of players. I don't know how commentary works, but I can do this.\" After\r\nthese first, trial broadcasts, both of the above-mentioned shoutcasters admitted to going back and\r\nwatching traditional sportscasters to learn more about their craft.\r\nOther broadcasting style conventions such as how to handle dead-air, how to end a\r\nsegment, or how to transition into gameplay were lifted directly from sportscasting. Paul\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n50\r\n\"ReDeYe\" Chaloner, a prominent personality within the e-sports industry, addresses each of\r\nthese techniques in his primer on becoming a professional shoutcaster, constantly pointing to various examples from traditional sports broadcasting to illustrate his points. In his section on dead-air, Chaloner writes, \"[o]ne of the best pieces of advice I had for TV was from legendary\r\nsports producer Mike Burks (11 time Emmy award winner for sports production) who told me 'A\r\ngreat commentator knows when to shut up and say nothing\"' (2009, 9). Chaloner uses traditional\r\nsports broadcasting as a way to explain shoutcasting, a clear indication of its influence on e-\r\nsports broadcasting.\r\nContent Analysis: Play-by-play and Color Commentary in the NFL andLCS\r\nAnother convention lifted directly from traditional sports broadcasts is the arrangement\r\nof the casting team. Traditional television sportscasters fall into one of two roles: play-by-play or\r\ncolor commentary. Shoutcasters use these same two roles. Both sports broadcasts and e-sports\r\nbroadcasts feature one of each type. The play-by-play commentator narrates the action, putting\r\ntogether the complicated and unconnected segments of the game into a cohesive narrative. The\r\ncolor commentator provides their in-depth analysis of the game, typically from the stance of a professional player.\r\nShoutcasters have adopted the two-person team directly from traditional sports\r\nbroadcasts. The path to each role follows the same pattern as well. An ex-professional player\r\nalmost always fills the role of color commentary in both traditional sports and e-sports. Their\r\ninsight is unparalleled. Color commentators attempt to breakdown complex series of events or\r\nhighly technical maneuvers as if they were still a professional player. In the words of one e-\r\nsports color commentator, \"I'm not pretending to be a professional player, but I'm doing my best\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n51\r\nto emulate them.\" He goes on to say, \"You can read up on it and study it as much as you like, but unless you've lived it, you can't really comment on it.\" In comparison, a play-by-play\r\ncommentator does not need to have the technical depth, but relies more on presentation. Even\r\nthough a play-by-play commentator has most likely played hundreds of hours of whichever game\r\nthey cast, they cannot fill the role of the color commentator. This dynamic allows for play-by-\r\nplay commentators to switch games with relative ease whereas color commentators, both in\r\ntraditional sports and e-sports, are locked into one game.\r\nTo illustrate the emulation of sports broadcasting found in e-sports, I now turn to a brief\r\ncontent analysis of the commentary found in a regular season NFL game and a regular season\r\nLeague of Legends Championship Series game. I start with the commentary from one play in an\r\nNFL game. After presenting the traditional model, I move to the commentary from one team\r\nfight in League of Legends to demonstrate how the convention has been adapted for e-sports\r\ncommentary. In both cases, I have removed the names of players, commentators, and teams to\r\ncut down on jargon and clutter. Each case exhibits the dynamic present in the two man\r\ncommentary team.\r\nNFL\r\nWith both teams lined up, the play begins and the play-by-play commentator comes in immediately.\r\nPlay-by-play: Here's [player 1] out to midfield, a yard shy of a first down. [player 2] on the tackle.\r\nAfter the play has ended, the color commentator takes over.\r\nColor: It's been [team 1] on both sides of the ball. Whether it be defense and the way that they dominated this ball game and then offensively, the early going had\r\nthe interception, didn't get much going over the next couple of possessions offensively but since that time, [player 3] has been very precise in how he has thrown the football and they just attacked this defense every which way.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n52\r\nLCS\r\nThree members ofthe Red Team engage Blue Team atRed Team's turret\r\nPlay-by-play: This is going to be dangerous. Doing what he can to hold out. They're going to grab the turret, the fight will continue after the shield onto [player 1] is already broken. He gets hit, the ignite is completely killing the\r\nultimate! He gets hit by [player 2] who turns around again and heads back to [player 3].\r\nWith the action overfor the moment, the colorcommentatorbegins to speak\r\nColor: I thought he finished a camp here too...\r\nThe color commentatoris cut off as two more members ofBlue Team attempt to attack.\r\nPlay-by-Play Heyo, as the top side comes in here too. [player 1], will he hit a good ultimate!? Oh! They were staring right at him but now he's just left to get shredded apart here. They couldn't have thought that this was going to go well for them.\r\nWith thefightconcluded, thecolorcommentatorcontinuesagain.\r\nColor: Is this just the week of chaos? Because that was a really really uncharacteristic lapse in judgement from [Blue Team]: Not calling everybody into\r\nposition at the right time, and [Red Team] with the advantage make them pay for it. They didn't expect the ignite from Nautilus. I think they expected Nautilus to\r\nhave exhaust instead, but [player 1] pops the ignite, and as we said there is no armor so [player 2] just... and it continues!\r\nThe color commentator is cut off once again as the two teams engage one another for a third time.\r\nIf we look at these examples for their content rather than the specific moment in the game we can\r\ncatch a full illustration of the two-caster dynamic. As we can see by the NFL example, the play-\r\nby-play commentator provides a running narration of the action in the game. When the action\r\nends, the color commentator provides the meta-level analysis of the unfolding events. In the LCS\r\nexample, we see that the same dynamic is present, however, due to the continuous action in the\r\ngame, the transition into color commentary becomes difficult. In the first lull, the LCS color\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n53\r\ncommentator tries to insert his analysis, but he is cut off by a second engagement. The color\r\ncommentator stops talking immediately and allows the play-by-play commentator to continue\r\ndescribing the action. After the engagement ends, we hear the color commentator pick up again, explaining why the fight developed the way it did as well as his insight into why the teams played the way they did.\r\nEntertainment and Narrative\r\nEntertainment value was a repeated concept in my interviews with shoutcasters. Some\r\nwent so far as to claim that their role was only to entertain. One stated, \"I want to get you\r\nexcited. I want to get you to watch the game as if it was a show on television.\" Many would\r\npoint to good sportscasters as an example to follow. If we recall the example of the early days of\r\nradio sportscasting, casters had a difficult time making the transition to the new medium. Their\r\nbroadcasts felt flat when compared with their print counterparts (Bryant and Holt 2006, 27).\r\nEarly sportscasters got locked into the idea that their responsibility was to provide the basic play-\r\nby-play depiction of a match. The golden age of sports radio was brought in by popular\r\nsportscasters, such as Graham McNamee, who were so popular that they'd be asked to cast\r\ngames remotely. McNamee, like a live version of his print counterparts, was famous for creating\r\nflorid depictions of the game, athletes became heroes and their play became combat as told by\r\nMcNamee. While the presentation of live and accurate information was still essential, popular\r\nradio sportscasters shifted sports media from news reports to entertainment. Sportscasters are\r\nresponsible for this shift. Without their expert embellishment, play-by-play depictions lack\r\nentertainment value.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n54\r\nEven non-sports fans can feel the excitement from a particularly good sportscaster. The\r\ngame they portray is far more intriguing than any actual events happening on the field (Bryant,\r\nBrown, Comisky, and Zillmann 1982). This disconnect forms one of the primary reasons that the\r\ntransition to casting televised sport was so difficult. The small liberties that sportscasters took\r\nwere no longer acceptable in the visual medium. Once the home viewer could see the game,\r\ncommentary had to shift to accommodate more scrutiny. Radio sportscasters were notorious for\r\ntheir embellishment. As Bryant, Comisky, and Zillman note from one of their several\r\ninvestigations of sportscasting, roughly forty percent of commentary is dramatic embellishment\r\n(1977). In 1977, the authors tracked the amount of hyperbole and exaggeration in sports\r\nbroadcasting and found that over half of the speech was dedicated to drama. E-sports\r\nshoutcasters, by comparison, rarely use dramatic embellishment of action. A few of the\r\ninformants noted that they feel that embellishing actions is not possible due to their audience.\r\nThe e-sports audience as pictured by shoutcasters, includes mostly dedicated players.\r\nWhile many sports fans may play their sport casually, e-sports fans engage with the games they\r\nwatch regularly. As one shoutcaster explains, \"we've only ever gone out to a hardcore audience.\"\r\nHe acknowledges that the current audience is in flux, but the primary base of e-sports fans are\r\nintensely dedicated viewers and players. Because of this dynamic, shoutcasters feel that\r\nembellishment of the actions on screen would be difficult to slip past a discerning eye. Their\r\nbelief that dramatic embellishment isn't possible may say more about their understanding of\r\ntraditional sports fans than it does about their formulation of their role as commentators. While\r\nunacknowledged in interviews, the possibility for shoutcasters to add embellishment exists. Their\r\nchoice not to use embellishment speaks more to their formulation of the e-sports audience than it\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n55\r\ndoes to their casting quality. Instead of embellishment of action, shoutscasters rely on another\r\nconvention found in traditional sportscasting: narrative.\r\nStudies that focus on the media effects of sportscasting suggest that sportscasters\r\nfundamentally alter the audience perception of the telecast through story-telling and narrative\r\n(Krein and Martin 2006). Sportscasters take many liberties in their descriptions of the game to\r\nadd a dramatic flair. In several empirical studies, Bryant, Brown, Comisky, and Zillman (1979)\r\nfound that when sportscasters created a narrative of animosity between players, viewers felt an\r\nincreased amount of tension and engagement. They conclude that the narrative scope of the\r\nsportscaster is critical in the perception of sports broadcasting. This narrative creation has bled\r\ninto shoutcasting as many shoutcasters attempt to amplify the emotional content of their games\r\nby highlighting underdog stories or hyping up animosity between players. One caster I\r\ninterviewed connected his work to the narrative creation in sports commentary by stating,\r\n\"Emotion is one of the key words in commentary. You need to be able to connect a certain\r\nemotion to the words you're saying. You need to be able to make someone scared for their\r\nfavorite player or overjoyed when they win. Create greatest enemies. You need to be able to\r\nmake these feelings through what you say or how you say it. Emotion is everything.\" This caster\r\ngoes to great lengths to dig up statistics from previous matchups to provide a narrative for the\r\nmatch he casts. Through this investigation, the shoutcaster is able to contextualize a match with a\r\nrich history. Perhaps two players have met three times before and each time the result has been\r\nthe same. Will viewers be able to share in the momentous victory of the underdog? As part of\r\ntheir preparation, shoutcasters will research all of the previous meetings between two players to\r\ncreate a history between them, a tactic which they acknowledge has been used in traditional\r\nsports for decades.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n56\r\nProduction\r\nStream production is another realm where e-sports have started to borrow heavily. While\r\ne-sports producers may have gotten a head start on streaming live events, they often rely on the\r\nexpertise of television producers to put a show together. Multiple shoutcasters pointed to a\r\nsteady influx of television producers making their way into e-sports, \"the way we approach a\r\nproduction is very much like television. A lot of the production guys that are getting into it are\r\nfrom television.\" In fact, the executive producer of the League of Legends Championship Series, an immensely popular e-sports program, is former emmy-winner Ariel Horn. Horn won his Emmy as an associate producer of the 2004 Olympics for NBC. Likewise, Mike Burks, executive producer for the Championship Gaming Series mentioned in the above quote from Paul Chaloner, had an immense amount of experience in televised sports before migrating to e- sports. These are just two of the many experienced television producers making their way into e- sports. Their style is beginning to show as e-sports events become more polished every year. If we recall the image of Prime Time League in the introduction to this thesis, we can see the influx of television conventions in e-sports from the production side. The shoutcasters benefit from the experience of working with television producers to refine their style. As the field has grown, however, we begin to see minor tweaks in style and delivery. Spending a significant time with e- sports casting, in comparison with sportscasting, reveals several distinctions. Much of this difference comes with the age of the field, but just as Starcadeevolved over its short lifespan, shoutcasters have found ways to make themselves unique. Their understanding of their role within the overall e-sports industry informs us of some of the key differences here.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n57\r\nSomething New: Shoutcaster Identity\r\nShoutcasters are situated somewhere between fan and professional. As evidenced by the\r\nabove investigation of how shoutcasters are informed by their traditional predecessors, the role\r\nof shoutcasters is still very much in flux. Shoutcasters are just recently creating their own\r\nidentity separate from their sportscasting roots. In particular, the less experienced shoutcasters I\r\nspoke with use markedly different models to inform their own casting.\r\nThe Second Generation of Professional Shoutcasters\r\nA second generation of casters is just now coming into the scene. Instead of looking to\r\ntraditional sportscasters as their models, they emulate veteran shoutcasters: \"my influences are\r\nthe streamers that I watched. I watched everyone who casts and commentates...my commentary\r\nstyle comes from those guys. I don't know how much is conscious or just mimicry.\" This new\r\ncaster has been on the scene for only a fraction of the time that the veterans have. In that time he\r\nhas honed his shoutcasting skills not by finding sports commentary and seeing which aspects\r\napply to shoutcasting, but by absorbing as much information as he could from other shoutcasters.\r\nAnother fresh shoutcaster offers a fascinating disconnect from the older casters: \"I definitely\r\nbounce off more e-sportscasters than sports. I just watch more e-sports than sports. Sports are so\r\ndifferent than e-sports, there's so little that I can actually use from them.\" Where his\r\npredecessors admit to borrowing primarily from traditional sportscasters, this new generation has\r\nleft the realm of traditional sportscasting behind.\r\nThe professional casters provide material for an amateur level of shoutcasters to pull\r\nfrom. The shoutcasters I interviewed were all professionals who typically work on major events\r\nwith massive support and budgets. With a robust network of shoutcasters to pull from, however,\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n58\r\nwe may see much more support for the grassroots level of e-sports that many early fans are\r\naccustomed to. Current shoutcasters also provide a model for potential careers. Through the\r\nhard-fought struggle of years-worth of unpaid events, the shoutcasters I spoke with have created\r\na legitimate profession worth pursuing. Most warned me that the path is no longer as easy as they\r\nonce had it. Most of them pursued shoutcasting for the love of e-sports. They had years to\r\nfumble through persona creation, broadcast techniques, and conventions.\r\nNew, potential shoutcasters are automatically held to a higher standard. A senior caster\r\noffered the following advice, \"With how casting has changed, you need to be open to casting\r\nmultiple games. You have to be willing to learn. There is a lot we can teach a caster, but you\r\nhave to have some skills within you alone. You have to have some camera presence.\" The\r\nmention of camera presence signals a significant jump from early shoutcasting. Just a few years\r\nago, the shoutcasters I interviewed sat down in front of a camera for the first time armed with\r\nnothing but game knowledge; camera presence was a foreign word to them.\r\nPerhaps the most significant change to casters is their overall level of experience. Some\r\nof the shoutcasters I spoke with have been broadcasting for over a decade. Time has allowed\r\nthese casters to experiment and find their own style. As mentioned earlier, many of the minutia\r\ninvolved in running a show take time to learn. Most casters got their start casually. They may\r\nhave been passionate about e-sports and created a role for themselves within the industry. Some\r\nare former players who made the hard decision to give up on their hopes of winning big to\r\ninstead cultivate a community.\r\nAs new professionals, shoutcasters are just now coming together with the support of e-\r\nsports companies under legitimate full-time contracts. The professional casters I spoke with all\r\nacknowledged a significant change in their commentary since making the transition into full-time\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n59\r\ncasting with other casters around for feedback and training. One explained that he had never\r\nbeen sure how to handle dead-air, moments when both casters are silent and there is little action\r\nin the game. Through feedback sessions with other casters, he learned that there are some\r\nappropriate times to let the viewer formulate their own opinions on the match. Heeding the\r\nadvice of veteran casters like Paul Chaloner, he went on to explain that one of the problems he\r\nsees in shoutcasting more generally is that shoutcasters are afraid to just be quiet during a stream.\r\nPart of the emotional build-up of a game, he explains, is letting the natural flow of a game take\r\nits course without any input from the casters.\r\nIt will be fascinating to watch as these expert networks inform e-sports broadcasts across\r\nthe world. One informant remarked, \"Now that we're all working together, we're learning a lot\r\noff of one another, which hasn't happened in commentary before.\" Beyond allowing veteran\r\nshoutcasters to compare notes, the professional status of shoutcasting provides training to new\r\nshoutcasters. One veteran claimed, \"All the junior people are learning so much faster than we\r\never did. They're taking everything we learned over 5-10 years and doing it in months.\" These\r\nveteran casters can now pass on their experience and their style. Techniques like hand-offs at the\r\nend of a segment or transitions from the desk to gameplay often came up in my interviews as\r\nissues which take years to learn, but newer shoutcasters are able to pick these cues up from\r\nearlier shoutcasters instead of taking what they can from a sports show and hoping that\r\neverything translates well.\r\nBeyond the expected roles that shoutcasters fill, they also perform many secondary tasks\r\nwhich don't typically fall to traditional sportscasters. In the very early days of live-streaming, shoutcasters were often responsible for every aspect of the broadcast from set-up to teardown. Some shoutcasters still regularly assist on production aspects of the broadcast such as graphics\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n60\r\npackages, camera set-up, and audio checks, but others leave the production aspects of the stream\r\nto more experienced hands while focusing instead on updating websites, answering tweets, creating content, or streaming their own play sessionss. No two casters seem to fill exactly the same role within the broadcast team. They do, however, share some similarities which seem to form the shoutcaster identity.\r\nRecord-keepers and Community Managers\r\nAll of the casters pointed to stats-tracking as part of their roles outside of their air-time\r\nresponsibilities. Most of them keep highly detailed databases full of every possible stat they can\r\nget a hold of from game clients and public databases. These stats can be as simple as wins and\r\nlosses from remote regions or LAN tournaments that do not post their results online. The stats\r\ncan also get as minute as the number of units a particular Starcraft 2 player built in one particular\r\nmatch. When the data isn't readily available, shoutcasters go out of their way to curate the\r\ndatabase themselves. While some keep their database secret to provide a personal flair to their\r\ncasting, others find it important to share this information with their e-sports communities. One\r\nshoutcaster recalled his surprise when he first worked with a major South Korean e-sports\r\ncompany with its own dedicated stats team. He expressed that he had never realized how much\r\nhe needed a dedicated stats team like you find in traditional sports until that moment. It was then\r\nthat he realized how much of his daily routine stats curation filled. While he was grateful for the\r\nhelp, he also felt personally responsible for stats collection and did not entirely trust the figures\r\nfrom the professional statisticians. This example shows the difficult position e-sports fills,\r\nconstantly stuck between borrowing from traditional sports while not fully able to cope with the\r\nmaturity of the sports media industry.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n61\r\nAnother role which tends to fill a shoutcaster's daily routine is community maintenance.\r\nWhether the caster creates their own content on gaming sites, responds to fans on social media,\r\nor spends their time streaming and interacting with the community, they all mentioned some\r\nform of community maintenance as part of their duties as a shoutcaster. This particular focus on\r\ncommunity maintenance most likely results from the grassroots origins of shoutcasters. These\r\ncasters were a part of an e-sports community long before they became shoutcasters. Whether\r\nthey view it as their professional responsibility or a social responsibility remains unclear. They\r\nall admit to some level of e-sports advocacy, however. They view PR, and the proliferation of e-\r\nsports as part of their responsibilities. The most effective way to tackle this issue, many of them\r\nhave decided, is through community engagement. The community aspect of shoutcasting identity\r\nleads me to a discussion of the affordances of the hyper-connectivity in live-streaming.\r\nGrappling with the Hyper-Connectivity in Live-streaming and E-sports\r\nShoutcaster Connection\r\nI have yet to meet anyone in the e-sports industry who has not remarked on the unique\r\nlevel of connection present in e-sports. Shoutcasters especially, tap into the network created in\r\nthese online communities. In a representative summary of my conversations, one shoutcaster\r\nexplained, \"the connectedness is so unique in e-sports. The way that we can interact with fans\r\ninstantly. The players at the end of the day are gamers, they know exactly where to look.\r\nThey've got Twitter, they go on Facebook, they post on Reddit.\" Audience members connect\r\nephemerally in the IRC of a Twitch stream, but they constantly scour the social media outlets of\r\ntheir favorite stars, e-sports companies, and shoutcasters, creating a deeply connected\r\ncommunity. Professional shoutcasters understand that the e-sports communities operate in a\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n62\r\nunique way when compared to traditional sports fandom. E-sports fans have an odd connection\r\nto franchises or teams within their chosen e-sport. As mentioned before, turnover rates and\r\ngeneral industry growth force entire communities to radically reform from one season to another.\r\nWhere traditional sports fans often follow a team based on geographic loyalty, or\r\nfamilial connections, e-sports fans do not have that option. While you will often hear of fans\r\ncheering for teams in their geographic region (North America, Europe, South-East Asia, etc) if\r\nthey make it to the last few rounds of an international tournament, they may also base their\r\nfandom off of a team logo, or a particular player instead. Shoutcasters recognize this dynamic\r\nand use it to cultivate the community.\r\nCommunication, they claim, separates them from traditional sports broadcasts or even\r\nnews anchors: \"We communicate more with our audience than you'll see TV news anchors or\r\ncelebrities, but it's part of our job to get more information out there.\" The focus on\r\ncommunication seems to be unique to shoutcasters as the majority of it happens outside of their\r\nbroadcasts. While many shoutcasters define their role on-screen as an educator of sorts, the\r\nnotion of spreading information about e-sports falls outside of their screen time. This double role\r\nof broadcaster and community manager extends what media scholars have dubbed the\r\nbroadcasting persona beyond the point typically associated with sportscasters or news anchors.\r\nShoutcasters and Persona\r\nHorton and Wohl (1956), two social scientists who study mass media, make the assertion\r\nthat mass media performers make a conscious decision to create and maintain parasocial\r\ninteractions through the creation of a persona. Social scientists have coined the term parasocial\r\ninteraction for the intangible connection which most of us feel to some form of media or another.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 63\r\nStanding in contrast to interpersonal interaction, a person to person exchange between two real\r\nand cognizant human beings, parasocial interaction is instead a unidirectional relationship\r\n(Miller and Steinberg 1970). The feeling of connection we create with fictional characters, news\r\nanchors, or sports stars does not fall within the definition of an interpersonal interaction. Whether\r\nmediated through a screen or the pages of a book, a parasocial interaction does not manifest in an\r\nexchange of thoughts or words between individuals. Rather, it is embodied and lived through one\r\nindividual. Schiappa et al. (2007) conducted a meta-analysis of parasocial interaction literature to\r\nbetter understand how broadcasters 'hook' viewers to a certain show. They concluded that\r\nparasocial interactions can create and prolong connection to television programming. While\r\nSchiappa et al. concede that there are a few opportunities for a parasocial interaction to result in\r\ninterpersonal relationships in the physical world, the compelling issue is the establishment of\r\nintimacy mediated through means well outside of a person to person context.\r\nHorton and Wohl set out with the goal of creating a term for the relationship between\r\nperformers and their audience in mass media. The authors suggest that the emergence of mass\r\nmedia created an illusion of connection to performers which was previously unavailable. They\r\nargue that the connection people feel to mass media stars is analogous to primary social\r\nengagement. If this type of engagement takes place in radio and television, where users have no\r\nopportunity to interact with audience members who are not co-present, it follows that the\r\ninteraction between broadcasters, their audience, and one another in a Twitch stream is a\r\nparticularly deep connection even beyond the level noticed by Horton and Wohl.\r\nShoutcasters create a familiar face and personality for audience members to connect with.\r\nMark Levy (1979), another proponent of parasocial interaction who focused his work on news\r\nanchors, suggests that both news anchors and sportscasters help to create and maintain\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 64\r\ncommunities through regular scheduling, conversational tones, and the creation of a broadcasting\r\npersona. Shoutcasters perform this same role to even greater effect due to the constant changes\r\nsurrounding the e-sports industry. The regularity and consistency of shoutcasters' broadcasts\r\nhelps to foster a feeling of genuine connectedness within the community.\r\nAlthough difficult to quantify, many conversations with shoutcasters turned to the odd\r\nfeeling of connection that e-sports fans feel towards one another. One shoutcaster attempted to\r\nexplain this connection by stating, \"[w]henever I go to an event, I realize that fans are just\r\nfriends I haven't met yet.\" I found this statement to be particularly poignant. It hints to the sort of\r\nintangible connection e-sports industry personalities and fans feel to one another through live-\r\nstreams. Anecdotally, this air of friendship permeated e-sports events that I have attended and\r\nwent well beyond what I have felt at traditional sporting events or concerts.\r\nPreviously, persona creation and maintenance occurred on-screen or at events only.\r\nSocial media has forced many media personalities to extend their personas beyond the long-held\r\nnotions of broadcaster-fan interaction. In many ways, shoutcasters must go beyond even these\r\nextended boundaries into a near constant persona maintenance because of their roles in live-\r\nstreaming and community maintenance. Many shoutcasters give up their personal, off-air time to\r\nstream their own gameplay or to create video content which necessarily prolongs the amount of\r\ntime they embody their broadcast persona.\r\nI found that shoutcasters create a variation on the broadcast persona. Rather than a full-\r\nblown broadcasting personality which they inhabit while on-air, most shoutcasters have found\r\nthat between community management, social media interactions, and broadcasts, they almost\r\nnever get an opportunity to step out of their role as a shoutcaster. Due to this near constant\r\nconnection, most shoutcasters acknowledge that they act differently on air, but they tend to\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 65\r\nsimply invoke a more upbeat and charismatic version of themselves. Echoed in each of the\r\ninterviews, the casters point to the idea of excitement, \"you have to get excited for the person out\r\nthere watching.\" Even if they are not in the mood to shoutcast, or they have had a bad day,\r\nshoutcasters must leave their personal issues out of the broadcast. This aspect of the\r\nshoutcaster's personality comes out in all of their interactions on social media as well.\r\nMost of the shoutcasters I interviewed situated their role in e-sports as somewhere\r\nbetween Public Relations, Marketing, and Community Management. One of the casters\r\nexplained the importance of invoking the broadcast persona when speaking about sponsor\r\nexpectations: \"We're working in an industry with companies behind us, we can't always say\r\nexactly what we want to say.\" Shoutcasters' acknowledgement of their involvement in securing\r\nsponsorships signals an interesting shift in the e-sports industry: the focus of the broadcast team\r\non potential revenue generation. I turn now to an analysis of the revenue streams found in both\r\ntraditional sports and e-sports broadcasting.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n66\r\nChapter 3\r\nRevenue\r\nFunding Professional Play\r\nAfter situating e-sports broadcasting within the greater sports media landscape,\r\nparticularly in conventions, casting, and use of medium, it is important to analyze the portions of\r\nsports media production that have made their way into e-sports broadcasting. If we acknowledge\r\nthe influence that traditional sports broadcasting has had on e-sports broadcasting in the realms\r\nof conventions and casting, we must also understand the importance of this relationship at the\r\nproduction and economic levels. In this chapter I discuss how the history and development of the\r\nsports media industrial complex in the U.S. has bled into the economics of the e-sports industry.\r\nIn particular, I focus on how sports media models inform the e-sports industry while portions of\r\nthe sports industry's revenue streams remain out of reach for e-sports broadcasters. Despite the\r\nreshuffling of the sports media industrial complex mentioned in the introduction to this thesis,\r\ntraditional sports broadcasting still relies on the same revenue streams that it had in the past.\r\nTraditional sports producers have fully capitalized on the commodification of their content. E-\r\nsports producers, in contrast, are still shaping their revenue streams within live-streaming. The\r\ncommercialization found in the sports media industrial complex has taken hold of the e-sports\r\nindustry in several notable ways. Following in the example set by Stein's thesis work, it is not\r\nenough to just acknowledge the relationship between e-sports and traditional sports media, we\r\nmust also understand the path which brought e-sports broadcasting to its current state.", "full_prompt": "E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n8\r\nIntroduction\r\nSportscasters on a Digital Field\r\nSitting at a desk underbright lights, two announcerstalk at afast clip.

From theirhome computers, these\r\nviewers have just witnessed e-sports history.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 9\r\nThe above scene unfolded at the 2014 Intel Extreme Masters World Championships in\r\nLeague of Legends, a popular e-sports title. The solo maneuver that Xpeke performed on that\r\nstage has since made its way into common LeagueofLegends vernacular, being invoked in any\r\nmatch, casual or professional, where a player deftly ends a game singlehandedly. E-sports, which\r\nencompasses many more titles than League of Legends, has become a cultural phenomenon of\r\nsorts. People may wonder whether the whole scene is just a flash in the pan or something more\r\nsignificant.\r\nI begin this thesis in much the same way that I have begun many conversations over the\r\npast two years: defining e-sports. In most of those conversations, I simply say \"professional\r\nvideo-gaming\" and move on to other topics. Here, though, I fully elaborate on what e-sports\r\nmeans. More than just professional gaming, e-sports is an entire industry created around\r\ncompetitive gaming at all levels of play. An e-sport is not a just a sports video game like the title\r\nmight suggest, though some e-sports titles are sports video games. Instead, e-sports titles are\r\nmeticulously balanced, competitive, multiplayer games. Many games would fall into this\r\ncategory, but it takes a community of people to take an e-sport to the level of the classics like\r\nCounter Strike and Starcraft.\r\nSuch communities are core to the identity of e-sports. Indeed, this identity itself is an\r\noxymoronic collision of geek and jock culture; a mixture that media would have us believe acts\r\nlike oil and water. Even within e-sports communities lines are hazy and misdrawn. As Taylor\r\nand Witkowski (2010) show in their study of a mega-LAN event, the e-sports scene is fraught\r\nwith identity issues not only from outside, but within as well. The jock-like first-person-shooter\r\n(FPS) players competing at the same event as the nerdy, enigmatic World of Warcraft players\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n10\r\nshows the conflicting, lived masculinities in e-sports. Players are unsure whether to act like\r\nsuperstar athletes or tech-geeks. Can you be both?\r\nThe word e-sports alone evokes such a conflicting image. Electronic sports seems almost\r\nparadoxical in nature. Have we moved beyond a physical match of skill and extended our\r\ncontests to avatars in a digital world? How can two players sitting at a desk be sporting? As e-\r\nsports continue to grow not only as a segment of the gaming industry, but as a spectator affair,\r\nwe begin to see the 'sports' side of e-sports both challenged and invoked more frequently. In a\r\ntelling case, Twitter erupted after a Dota 2 tournament made an appearance on ESPN 2 in\r\n2014. With $10 million at stake, many e-sports fans thought the event warranted the attention of\r\nthe all-sports network. Plenty of viewers took to social media to praise the move made by ESPN.\r\nOthers were shocked: \"Espn2 is seriously airing an online gaming championship? Wtf man. This\r\nis our society now. That is not a sport\" (Hernandez 2014). The sports status of e-sports has been\r\nboth defended and attacked by journalists, academics, and fans alike.\r\nThe debate about the status of e-sports has been raging for many years. Witkowski's\r\npiece, \"Probing the Sportiness of E-Sports\", presents both sides of the argument pulling from\r\ngames studies scholars and assessing e-sports on their terms. Ultimately though, I believe she\r\nshelves the debate deftly when she states, \"sport is a personal experience... as many a sporting\r\nscholar has written before - if an individual considers the sporting activity they are engaged in to\r\nbe a sport... then it is a sport\" (2009, 56). I do not wish to rehash this debate. I have no stake in\r\nit. As Witkowski asserts, the attempt would be futile. Instead, I accept the role traditional sports\r\nhave played in the shaping of e-sports.\r\nIn fact, exploring the relationship between e-sports and their traditional counterpart drives\r\nthis work. In what follows, I argue that the sports media industrial complex has fundamentally\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n11\r\nshaped the current e-sports industry. Beyond this grounding, e-sports broadcasters constantly\r\nborrow from traditional televisual broadcasts, using models that they feel to be appropriate for\r\ntheir medium. Regardless of whether e-sports qualify as sports or not, they are constantly\r\ninformed by sports broadcasting and follow a trajectory set out by traditional sports models.\r\nThis work comes about at in an interesting moment in e-sports history. E-sports\r\naudiences have never been larger, Riot games boasted an impressive 27 million viewers for the\r\nLeague ofLegends World Championship in 2014 while the 2015 Intel Extreme Masters world\r\nchampionship saw over 1 million concurrent viewers across multiple live-streaming platforms\r\n(Riot Games 2014; ESL 2014). An old classic, CounterStrike, has re-emerged, albeit in a new\r\npackage. The audience it continues to draw proves that some titles have staying power in this\r\nfickle industry. At the same time, a new title, League ofLegends, consistently pulls in over\r\n100,000 concurrent viewers for its weekly shows in the U.S. and E.U. As the League ofLegends\r\nChampionship Series moves into its fifth season, it has come to resemble a traditional sports\r\nbroadcast more than it does its fellow e-sports shows. A new addition in Season 5, a segment\r\ncalled Prime Time League (PTL) is nearly indistinguishable from ESPN's Pardon the\r\nInterruption (PTI) at a glance.\r\nFigure 1-Left Image: Prime Time League; Right Image: Pardon the Interruption\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 12\r\nComparing these two images reveals the level of sports emulation found in e-sports broadcasting\r\ntoday. From the stats and schedule ticker at the bottom of the screen to the show rundown along\r\nthe edge of the screen, an uninitiated viewer would have difficulty distinguishing between the e-\r\nsports show and the traditional sports show.\r\nA steady influx of television producers and directors are starting to shape an industry that\r\nalready has an identity crisis while still investigating how best to harness the new medium of\r\nlive-streaming. These assertions are not meant to give the impression that we stand on the edge\r\nof wholly untouched land as pioneers in a new frontier. As shown in the e-sports literature\r\nreview to follow, the e-sports industry has a history of evoking the feeling of standing on a\r\nprecipice.\r\nOrganization\r\nIn the introduction, I first provide a brief history of e-sports and take note of the\r\ndirections e-sports scholarship has pursued. Following this review, I introduce the sports media\r\nindustrial complex to better situate e-sports broadcasting within the larger media landscape of\r\nsports broadcasting: the focus of chapter 1.\r\nThe first chapter begins by looking at the long history of sports and media. By\r\nintroducing the full gamut of sports media, I am better able to investigate how e-sports\r\nbroadcasting stays in conversation with each of its predecessors. As evidenced in the reshuffling\r\nof sports media through history, we can see that e-sports make use of all of these forms of media\r\nwhile creating something new. During this chapter, I look to the transition moments in traditional\r\nsports broadcasting as the foundation ofthe e-sports industry. Moments of tension and doubt\r\nwithin the sports media industry as it shifted from one medium to another provide perfect lessons\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 13\r\nto be learned by the e-sports industry as they struggle with some of the same issues found in the\r\nreshuffling of media history. Indeed, while making use of the same media through journalism,\r\npublic relations, and audiovisual broadcasts, the e-sports industry constantly wrangles with the\r\nuse of the newly emerged medium of live-streaming. Television especially influences live-\r\nstreamed broadcasts, which e-sports broadcasts tend to approach with the same framework as\r\ntelevision.\r\nChapter two focuses on e-sportscasters, also known as shoutcasters. I begin the chapter\r\nwith a brief look at the history of shoutcasting. Considering that many of the early shoutcasters\r\npull solely from traditional sportscasters, understanding their influences is crucial in\r\nunderstanding how e-sports has evolved in the way it has. As, I argue, the single most pointed\r\nsignaling of the sportiness in e-sports, these individuals have pushed the e-sports industry\r\ntowards a sports model. When first time viewers or listeners leave an e-sports broadcast with the\r\ndistinct feeling of a sports broadcast in their mind, it is the shoutcasters doing their job. They rely\r\nheavily on conventions set by traditional sportscasters. Much like their predecessors when faced\r\nwith something new, shoutcasters borrowed what they could and innovated when there was\r\nnothing to borrow. Chapter two also focuses on shoutcasters' formulation of their identity within\r\nthe e-sports industry as personalities, professionals, and record-keepers. Shoutcasters are just\r\nnow creating an identity separate from traditional sportscasting. Where veteran shoutcasters\r\nrelied primarily on traditional sports broadcasts, newer casters look instead to other shoutcasters.\r\nThese shoutcasters are reshaping their identity while attempting to fully embrace the new\r\nmedium of live-streaming.\r\nThe third and final chapter tackles the topic of economics in e-sports. As the history and\r\ntrajectory of sports broadcasting has profoundly affected the e-sports industry, many of the\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n14\r\neconomic models present in traditional sports bled into the e-sports industry as well. The e-sports\r\nindustry in the US and Europe has yet to be analyzed as such. Some work (Taylor 2012) has\r\nfocused on e-sports revenue streams including sponsorships, company models, and team\r\nownership, but overall, the subject remains underexplored. Dal Yong Jin's (2010) analysis of the\r\npolitical economy of e-sports in South Korea offers a tool set for this chapter. While the South\r\nKorean e-sports model spawned out of an extremely particular set of circumstances that cannot\r\nbe readily applied to the U.S. or E.U. e-sports scenes, Jin's investigation of the surrounding\r\neconomic systems surrounding e-sports translates well to my own investigation of the U.S. and\r\nE.U. industries. As staggering prize pools continue to make headlines, it is easy to lose sight of\r\nthe economic system working behind the scenes to keep e-sports financially salable, or in some\r\ncases not. The third chapter delves into traditional sports economics and their influence on the e-\r\nsports industry. In some areas, the models translate perfectly. In others, e-sports has been unable\r\nto tap into the same revenue generators as traditional sports. Unless some developments\r\nsignificantly alter the e-sports industry, it may be more tenable to pursue other models instead of\r\nthe sports industry.\r\nMethods\r\nThis thesis makes use of many qualitative methods including historical analysis,\r\ninterviews, and fieldwork. To grasp the significance and situation of e-sports broadcasting in its\r\ncurrent state fully, one must analyze the same developments in traditional sports broadcasting.\r\nAs one takes a deeper look into the past of the professional sporting industry, its influences on e-\r\nsports become clear. A feedback loop has been created between the two. Historical analysis\r\noffers a glimpse at key moments which defined the incredibly successful global sports industry.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 15\r\nNot only are similar situations appearing in e-sports, but e-sports pushes back into each of the\r\ninvestigated forms of media. A few of the issues currently facing e-sports could be resolved\r\nthrough following the path established by traditional sports, while other issues have been caused\r\nbecause so much has been borrowed.\r\nI also had the pleasure of conducting seven interviews with professional shoutcasters. I\r\nlimited the selection of shoutcasters to full-time professionals, rather than amateurs, to get an\r\ninsight into how these new professionals view their role within the industry. Roughly half the\r\nparticipants are veteran shoutcasters of five or more years. The other half have joined the scene\r\nmore recently with one in particular having shoutcasted professionally for less than one year. As\r\nthese informants are a few of only dozens of professional shoutcasters in the world, I have\r\nattempted to keep their identities anonymous. As professional personas, some of these casters\r\nmay benefit from being associated with this work, but I do not want to run the risk of potentially\r\nlinking these shoutcasters with their statements in the event that this information could somehow\r\naffect the community's perception of the individual or potentially harm their prospects within the\r\ne-sports industry. The conversations were all positive, but one can never truly assure their\r\ninformants that information they have provided in confidence will have no repercussion in any\r\nforeseeable future. With these considerations in mind I decided before conducting the interviews\r\nthat the informants would remain anonymous.\r\nFinally, I was also able to spend time working within the e-sports industry. My time spent\r\nworking for a prominent e-sports company profoundly shaped this thesis. Working alongside\r\nindustry professionals sparked countless conversations about the current climate of the e-sports\r\nindustry and possible futures. These conversations have both helped and challenged my thinking\r\nabout the e-sports industry. While I often refer to the e-sports industry or community as a\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 16\r\nhomogenous whole, the professionals who live within the space are not all of one mind and it\r\nwould be a mistake to present them that way. Within e-sports, there are many different games\r\nand communities vying for viewers, players, and attention. What follows is my best attempt at\r\nwrangling the many paths e-sports has started to follow.\r\nE-sports Literature Review\r\nE-sports is still a young industry and an even younger subject of critical inquiry. Most\r\nentries into e-sports scholarship have emerged within the last five years. E-sports literature tends\r\nto come from the much older tradition of games studies, but ties into many other fields including\r\nthe social sciences, cultural studies, economics, and law. Professional-gaming literature is a\r\nveritable hotbed of potential research topics with more articles, theses, and dissertations\r\nappearing every year. Much of the growing body of e-sports literature focuses on the\r\nprofessionalization of gaming (Jin 2010; Mora and Heas 2005; Swalwell 2009; Taylor, Nicholas\r\n2009; Taylor, T.L. 2012; Witkowski 2012). These histories offer much more than a rundown of\r\nthe events that created the e-sports industry. They also offer insight into our contemporary social\r\nmoment. The arrival of a professionalization of video gaming signals many significant\r\ndevelopments within both western and non-western culture. The global nature of e-sports and its\r\nmeshing together of complex and often conflicting identities continues to beg investigation.\r\nE-sports literature primarily resides within the social sciences. Many cultural analyses in\r\ne-sports (Chee and Smith 2005; Harper 2010 and 2014; Hinnant 2013; Swalwell 2009; Taylor\r\n2011) have focused on the communities growing within different scenes. Todd Harper, for\r\ninstance, investigates the culture of competitive fighting games, a fascinating community which\r\nstands both within and at odds with the rest of competitive gaming. Gender studies are also\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 17\r\nbecoming increasingly common within e-sports literature (Chen 2006; Crawford 2005; Leonard\r\n2008; Taylor 2009 and 2011; Taylor and Witkowski 2010; Witkowski 2013). With the\r\nfascinating and fraught formulation of masculinity within these spaces as well as the perceived\r\nabsence of femininity, gender studies are incredibly important within e-sports literature. Nicholas\r\nTaylor (2011) offers insight into the ability of e-sports to create embodied performances of\r\nmasculinity at live events which spread through communities specific to certain titles or genres.\r\nTaylor and Witkowski (2010) also show the conflicting versions of masculinity that appear in\r\ndifferent e-sports genres.\r\nThere has also been an increasing focus on e-sports as a spectator activity. Jeff Huang\r\nand Gifford Cheung (2012) found in a study that many of the e-sports fans they investigated\r\nprefer watching high-level play rather than playing a match themselves. Kaytou and Raissi\r\n(2012) also investigate spectatorship in e-sports with a focus on how best to measure live-\r\nstreaming audiences. Others (Bowman 2013; Gommesen 2012; Kow and Young 2013) show that\r\nthe audience in e-sports has a profound effect on performance for the players, akin to a\r\ntraditional sports audience. These scholars also investigate the expertise apparent in e-sports\r\nplayers that is passed on through spectating as often as practicing.\r\nAs the professional play of video games fascinates so many, e-sports literature has\r\nunderstandably focused primarily on professional players. Notable exceptions include Jin (2012)\r\nand Taylor (2012) who, while still heeding players, also investigate the surrounding factors\r\nwhich allow for play at a professional level. Without these other factors, professional players\r\nwould not exist. It is from the tradition of these two authors, among others, that I base this work.\r\nThis thesis, like many of the works listed above seeks to better understand the phenomenon of e-\r\nsports while analyzing a particular segment of the scene. With few investigations into the\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 18\r\nbroadcasting of e-sports, I hope to contribute to e-sports literature in a way that is both unique\r\nand replicable to other systems found within the larger e-sports framework.\r\nSports Media Industrial Complex\r\nAs sport and media become increasingly intertwined, it becomes difficult to analyze one\r\nwithout at least acknowledging the impact of the other. Pointing to the inextricable link between\r\nsports and media, sports media scholar K. Lefever (2012) argues, \"while sport provides valuable\r\ncontent and audiences for media operators, the media is a revenue source and promotional tool\r\nfor sport.\" As such, the steady professionalization and, in turn, commercialization of sport relies\r\nheavily on its media counterpart. The subsequent interdependence between media outlets,\r\nsponsors, and sports leagues creates what is often referred to as the sports/media complex or\r\nsports media industrial complex (Jhally 1989, Rowe 1999, Maguire 1991). Wenner (1989)\r\ncoined the neologism, MediaSport, to define the deeply rooted relationship between sports and\r\nmedia. The two can hardly be considered separate anymore.\r\nStein (2013), a Comparative Media Studies alumni, building on the work of these earlier\r\nscholars created a model which could be applied to new arrivals in the sports media landscape.\r\nThankfully, Stein provides a fairly replicable analysis of sports video games within the broader\r\nsports media landscape. His investigation of the relationship between televisual sports video\r\ngames and sports media largely informs my own work. He notes an almost relentless stream of\r\nadvertising and commercialization rhetoric appearing in sports video games. Building on the\r\nwork of Wenner, Rowe, and Jhally, he argues that the commodification and capitalist trends\r\nfound in traditional sports broadcasting bleed into newer media such as video games. This steady\r\ninflux of advertising and commercialization can be found in e-sports as well.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 19\r\nAs e-sports broadcasters gain more experience and access to more robust technology,\r\nthey have started to incorporate many of the same commercial opportunities Stein noticed in\r\nsports video games. Segments of the broadcast are occasionally sponsored, or one might see a\r\nsponsor make an appearance in an event's title such as the Intel Extreme Masters tournament.\r\nWhere Stein argues that sports video games incorporate these advertisements as a signifier of\r\ntheir televisual legitimacy, I argue that e-sports broadcasters make use of the same strategies\r\nbecause they are informed by earlier forms of sports media.\r\nThe steady commercialization found in e-sports reveals the influence that the sports\r\nmedia industrial complex has had on the e-sports industry. In documenting the dynamics of the\r\nsports media industrial complex, Jhally (1989) argues that sports are best viewed as\r\ncommodities. Jhally's model focuses on the sporting industry in the US prior to the emergence of\r\nnew media. More readily applicable to e-sports, Lefever's (2012) analysis of the sports media\r\ncomplex within new media details a phenomenon which has upended the former relationships\r\nbetween stakeholders in the sports media industrial complex. She claims that, \"the sports/media\r\ncomplex has somehow changed, allowing the different stakeholders to take up new roles\"\r\n(Lefever 2012, 13). The stakeholders, including sports franchises, sponsors, and media outlets,\r\nhave had to adapt to a new media landscape with new roles. These new roles are more transient\r\nwithin the high-demand world of new media. Sports organizations and franchises have taken a\r\nmore active role in connecting with fans, media outlets have taken a larger interest in sports\r\nfranchises (often buying sports franchises if it is less expensive than purchasing media rights),\r\nand sponsors have taken advantage of new, innovative ways to reach consumers (Lefever 2012,\r\n21). According to sports scholars Haynes and Boyle (2003), television sports viewers are no\r\nlonger expected to just sit back and relax. Instead they are expected to follow their sport through\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 20\r\nsocial media, forums, blogs, and other digital outlets. This new, active fan fits well within the e-\r\nsports industry and live-streaming, but has changed the traditional sports media industrial\r\ncomplex. Before delving too far into the role of traditional sports economic models on e-sports,\r\nhowever, I will first situate live-streaming and e-sports within the larger sports media industrial\r\ncomplex.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n21\r\nChapter 1\r\nSports Media in Transition From Print to Live-Streaming\r\nEvery day, millions of Americans are catching up with the latest sports news through\r\nprint, radio, television, and online. Sports have saturated the entire spectrum of mass media in\r\nthe US. With the emergence of each form of mass media, sports coverage has been at the\r\nforefront of adoption and innovation (Bryant and Holt 2006, 22). Each major medium shift in the\r\nUS has been accompanied by a massive reshuffling of the sports media landscape. Often, this\r\nreshuffling opens a space for a particular sport to take up the new medium, create conventions,\r\nand carve a path for others to follow. These sports were not spawned by mass media, but their\r\nspike in popularity around the emergence of a new medium indicates very specific social\r\nmoments in the US. Early sports magazines and print coverage of sports focused primarily on\r\nprize-fighting, radio ushered in the golden era of baseball, and television transformed football\r\ninto a titanic entertainment industry. The rise and stabilization of sports media are as much a\r\nproduct of available technology as they are indicative of societal preoccupations of the time. If\r\nsports and sports media are indicative of our social moment, then what can we glean from the\r\narrival of live-streaming and e-sports?\r\nThe co-evolution of sports and media is the coalescence of many factors including\r\nchanges in power structures, modes of production, and available technology. As Bryant and Holt\r\nargue in their investigation of the history of sports and media, \"[e]ach epoch of social evolution\r\nhas witnessed important sports-media developments that were affected by the evolving socio-\r\ncultural environment\" (2006, 22). In what follows, I trace the co-evolution of sports and media\r\nwith particular focus on the relationship between emerging mass media and the media ecology\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 22\r\nsurrounding that emergence. By documenting these moments of turbulence, I establish the\r\nframework necessary to analyze live-streaming as a new medium with which e-sports has\r\nemerged as an early adopter and convention creator. Live-streaming did not emerge\r\nindependently from its predecessors, but rather delivers on the preoccupations of our current\r\nsocial moment. It has once again started a reshuffling of the roles of media within the sports\r\nmedia complex. E-sports, while primarily viewed through live-streaming, relies on all of the\r\nprevious forms of media to varying degrees. With this framework in mind, I argue that the\r\nfeedback between live-streaming, e-sports, and traditional sports has spawned an industry which\r\nroots itself in traditional sports media while still investigating the full potential of live-streaming.\r\nI begin by briefly discussing sports media in antiquity with Thomas Scanlon's (2006)\r\npiece on ancient Mediterranean sports and media. After this introduction to sports media, I move\r\nto the US in the late eighteenth century with the emergence of the first sports-only publication,\r\nthe sports magazine, as well as early print news coverage of prize fighting during the rise of\r\nindustrialization and nationalism. The next section maps the push towards immediacy in sports\r\ncoverage and the rise of radio. On the heels of radio and the golden age of baseball, I discuss the\r\nearly issues with televised sport before the post-war era. Moving into the 1950s and 1960s, I\r\ndetail the transformation of football into a televisual sport accompanied by a very specific social\r\ncontingency. I then transition into an investigation of live-streaming and e-sports, particularly\r\nhow both are in conversation with sports media history.\r\nOrigins of Sports Media\r\nAs classicist Thomas Scanlon (2006) posits, there is no history of sports without its\r\nmedia counterpart. Media in antiquity, he argues, \"are a tool of society, a means of transmitting a\r\nmessage, primarily one from the rulers to the ruled\" (Scanlon 2006, 17). While his definition is\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 23\r\nquite limited, Scanlon is correct in noting that media are inflected with the power structures of a\r\nsociety. Sports as media were classically used by those with power to reinforce the hierarchy.\r\nSports events were \"represented as a benevolent benefaction from the rich, noble, and\r\nempowered to those marginalized\" (Scanlon 2006, 18). This reinforcement of power structures\r\ncomes through not only in the production of sporting events, but also in the medium itself.\r\nScanlon suggests that the most powerful sports 'medium' in classical times was Roman\r\narchitecture. The massive circuses and arenas were meant to \"provoke awe, admiration, and\r\nobedience in the citizens\" (Scanlon 2006, 18). Scanlon establishes that the predominant sports\r\nmedium in a given society correlates directly with their notions of power. Within the realm of\r\nmore dispersed authority such as the Ancient Greeks, sports media reflected the high value of an\r\nindividual and his merits. Depictions of athletics in Ancient Greek poetry and pottery, made by\r\nand for the common people, focus on a particular athlete's prowess more than the event itself. On\r\nthe other hand, societies with incredibly rigid hierarchies and god-kings such as the Ancient\r\nEgyptians and Persians, tend to represent sports as a demonstration of the ruler's power over\r\ntheir people. Ancient Rome, with its centrally focused authority, used architecture to demonstrate\r\nthe power of the nobility as both benefactors and arbiters, diminishing the role of the athlete to\r\nthat of an entertainer. Moving into more recent history with media such as newspapers and radio,\r\nScanlon concludes that sports media became an amalgamation of both the Roman and Greek\r\nstyles: large spectacles with massive personalities.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 24\r\nEstablishing a Media Landscape: Early Sports Media in America\r\nThe importance of the printing press on modem society cannot be overstated. While its\r\nprecise effects are still being debated', the affordances of the printing press allowed individuals\r\nto produce and disseminate a massive amount of information far more efficiently than ever\r\nbefore. With a massive rise in literacy rates and increased access to print brought about by the\r\nprinting press, the reading population of the world shifted (Eisenstein 1983). While early\r\nreadership was restricted to a very small subset of society, the printing press paved the way for\r\nthe coverage of more mundane topics such as sports. In their analysis of sports media in pre-\r\nindustrial America, sports media scholars Jennings Bryant and Andrea Holt point to two major\r\ndevelopments: first, the appearance of sports in newspapers as 'general news' and second the\r\ncreation of a completely sports-centered publication: the sports magazine (2006, 22). The advent\r\nand success of sports magazines in the early nineteenth century stands as a marker for some of\r\nthe intellectual shifts of the industrial era. During this time we see a professionalization of sport\r\nin the form of prize fighters. We also see a shift from sports as a local leisure activity to\r\nsomething that one follows from a distance. Sports contests began to take on implications\r\nbeyond a mere matching of athletes.\r\nMany sports magazines started out as independent, one-person operations that began\r\ncirculation in the 1820s and 1830s (Bryant and Holt 2006, 22). The Spiritof the Times, one of the\r\nearliest iterations of the sports magazine, actually reached a circulation of over 100,000 readers\r\nby the 1840s. The success of this initial sports-focused publication displays the roots of the\r\nAmerican sports media tradition. While they note the significance of sports magazines in the\r\noverall climate of sports media in America, Bryant and Holt trace the advent of modem sports\r\n1See Elizabeth Eisenstein. 1983. The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe. New York: Cambridge University Press.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 25\r\nmedia to recaps of prize fighting in the Penny Press age of the 1830s. With increased circulation\r\nto the middle and lower classes, sports coverage increased substantially in the mid-nineteenth\r\ncentury. Sports coverage in the Penny Press era focused on creating spectacular depictions of\r\nsporting events. As McChesney, a media historian points out, James Gordon Bennett, owner of\r\nthe New York Herald,was \"one of the first exponents of 'sensationalism' as a means of\r\ngenerating circulation, and sport fit comfortably within this rubric\" (1989, 51) Out of the\r\nsensationalism present in these early newspapers, sports began to take on more significant\r\ncultural meaning.\r\nThere was particular focus on regionalism and nationalism. Sports media scholar J.\r\nEnriquez explains that sporting events were far more likely to be covered if they featured a\r\ncontest which reflected the social preoccupations of the day such as a northern horse racing\r\nagainst a southern horse, or an American boxer fighting a European (2002, 201). Through these\r\nmediated depictions, sporting events were encoded with much more meaning than a simple\r\ncontest. They reflected the contemporary hopes and anxieties of the people. Sports media built\r\nup athletes as representatives. Newspaper recaps did much more than simply describe the\r\nactions; they created dramas (McChesney 1989, 51). The hyped up imagery of athletes and their\r\ncontests created through the Penny Press and sports magazines became the paradigm for sports\r\ncoverage for decades while a new sport caught America's attention.\r\nNewspaper Sports Writing and the Rise of Team Sports\r\nThe rise of baseball as a national pastime coincide with the period of time just after the\r\nAmerican Civil War. McChesney explains, \"The Civil War introduced baseball to an entire\r\ngeneration of Americans, as the troops on both sides played the game when time permitted.\r\nIndeed, baseball emerged as the preeminent national team sport during this period\" (1989, 52).\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 26\r\nAfter the Civil War, baseball helped mediate conflict by providing common ground for\r\nnortherners and southerners. This moment was one in which the country was seeking to heal its\r\nrift, looking for neutral things that could bind the nation together. Baseball filled a political\r\nagenda by giving people something to focus on without opening old wounds. Sports writing\r\nchanged drastically in the years following baseball's spike in popularity. Sports coverage began\r\nto receive regular columns and increased coverage throughout the late nineteenth century,\r\nleading to a new kind of journalistic specialization: the sports-writer (Enriquez 2002, 202). This\r\nfixation on sport was a result of new socio-cultural environments. Mandelbaum (2004), a sports\r\nmedia scholar and historian, argues that the industrial revolution created a new sports landscape\r\nthrough several major developments. First, the notion of childhood had expanded. In the\r\nnineteenth century, the period between birth and entering the workforce increased substantially.\r\nThe new notion of childhood permitted more people to engage with baseball, football, and\r\nbasketball. This increased interest in team sports continued into adulthood. Watching and reading\r\nabout sports in the newspaper or sports magazines became an acceptable way to recapture the\r\n\"carefree years of their lives\" (Mandelbaum 2004, 2). Mandelbaum also argues that baseball\r\noffered a renewed connection to pastoral America, creating a feeling of nostalgia for the new city\r\ndwellers and factory workers who desperately missed the pace and beauty of rural America.\r\nBaseball coverage created the first major feedback loop between sports and media in\r\nAmerica. Bryant and Holt claim that the importance of sport was downplayed significantly in the\r\npuritan era, but, \"regular, routine reporting of sports in newspapers and specialized magazines\r\nhelped shift the cultural attitude towards sports in general\" (Bryant and Holt 2006, 25). They\r\nargue that in the late 1870s through the 1890s, Americans adopted a new stance on sports as\r\nimportant for the development of mind, body, and society. This new cultural stance on sports\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 27\r\nwas shaped and fostered by an increased media coverage of sports. As baseball and its media\r\ncoverage became more professionalized, Americans began to consume sports media in\r\ncompletely different methods. Sports spectatorship became a regular and acceptable pastime for\r\nthe industrial worker.\r\nThe industrial revolution created the first opportunity in America for sports production\r\nand spectatorship to be commercially successful endeavors. The growth of cities and the massive\r\ndevelopments in individual mobility allowed for sporting events to take on new significance\r\n(Mandelbaum 2004, 3). Cities provided large numbers of sports players as well as spectators to\r\nfill newly built stadiums and watch newly formed teams. Sports fandom in the U.S. fit neatly\r\ninto the predominant forms of labor and leisure. Zillmann and Paulus (1993), two psychologists\r\nwho wrote on sports spectatorship, explain, \"spectatorship, as a significant form of recreation, is\r\nan outgrowth of the monotony of machine-dictated labor, sports events became the weekend love\r\naffair of all those whose workday was strictly regulated by production schedules\" (601).\r\nZillmann and Paulus' article further supports the feedback between sports media consumption\r\nand societal structures. Live spectatorship in America had previously been seen as a luxury for\r\nthe rich and powerful, but with the increased circulation of newspapers, and in particular sports\r\ncoverage, to the middle and lower classes, sports spectatorship became accessible to an entirely\r\nnew sector of the population (Bryant and Holt 2006, 21). Architecture once again emerged as an\r\nimportant medium. Large concrete and steel stadiums were created, replacing the more\r\norganically created playing fields of the late nineteenth century (Mandelbaum 2004, 52). We see\r\nhere an important transition into the production of sport as a money making opportunity. As I\r\ndiscuss in the third chapter, the introduction of investors and producers fundamentally alters\r\nsports and their media counterparts.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 28\r\nThe available media shaped the portrayal and perception of athletics in the industrial era\r\nas well. The idea may sound a bit romantic, but Benjamin Rader (1984), a sports scholar focused\r\non the transformation of sports media in America, labels the period of sports media prior to\r\ntelevision as an era of heroes. Whether speaking of prize-fighters or the Mighty Casey of\r\nfolklore, sports media in the industrial era painted athletes as larger-than-life characters. Rader\r\nclaims, \"[t]hose standing on the assembly lines and those sitting at their desks in the\r\nbureaucracies increasingly found their greatest satisfaction in the athletic hero, who presented an\r\nimage of all-conquering power\" (1989, 16). To Rader, sports media before television presented\r\nthe American ideal. Athletes were meritocratic role-models playing for the love of the game.\r\nRader's analysis places the impetus on newspapers to depict dramatic stories with characters\r\nakin to David and Goliath.\r\nIn addition to individual mobility, urbanization, and industrial work, Enriquez attributes\r\nthe rise and legitimacy of sports journalism as the catalyst for the nationalization of sports in\r\nAmerica (2002, 201). As all forms of communication and nationalization were transforming,\r\nsports coverage lead the charge. In the early twentieth century, most newspapers had dedicated\r\nsports writers on staff. These sports writers became famous through their innovative and\r\nentrancing writing. Writers like W. 0. McGeehan, who worked for many San Francisco papers,\r\ndescribed athletes as sorrowful sages and their contests as the clashing of titans on a battlefield\r\n(Nyhistory.org 2015). In this period however, it is difficult to judge the difference between\r\njournalism and public relations (Bryant and Holt 2006, 30). In fact, the issue of PR penetrating\r\njournalism in the late nineteenth to early twentieth century is explicitly laid out in Michael\r\nSchudson's (1981) chapter, \"Stories and Information: Two Journalisms in the 1890s\". At the turn\r\nof the century, there existed a dichotomy between news as entertainment and news as\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 29\r\ninformation. As papers around the country struggled to define themselves, sports media also\r\nwent through a defining period. Legitimate sports writing became known for its higher literary\r\nquality, but read more like advertisements with its exaggerated, often hyperbolic, language.\r\nPublic relations soon became as much a part of sports journalism as describing the events\r\nthemselves. Team owners understood the media's role in keeping attendance at sporting events\r\nup and began catering to sports journalists for coverage (Enriquez 2002, 206). The team owners\r\nexpected sports journalists to act as publicists for their events. The gambit paid off as sports\r\nwriting filled more and more of the daily papers and attendance at live events continued to rise.\r\nThe sports writers added significance to the experience of watching a sporting event. Between\r\nthe shifts in the American middle class, leisure activities, and the flowery language of sports\r\njournalism, watching a sporting event began to take on the significance of watching history\r\nunfold. We will see these same issues appear again in e-sports coverage as journalism becomes a\r\nlegitimizing force within the e-sports landscape, torn between deep analysis and hyped-up\r\ndepictions for the sake of generating publicity.\r\nLiveness continued to assert its role in sports media as new technologies emerged. The\r\ntelegraph especially placed the impetus on news sources to provide timely information. In a\r\nfascinating illustration of the desire for timely sports news, the ChicagoTribuneran the\r\nfollowing note on March 17, 1897, the day of the legendary boxing match between Jim Corbett\r\nand Rob Fitzsimmons: \"The Tribune will display bulletins today on the prize fight. It has secured\r\na telegraph wire to the ring in Carson City and a competent man will describe the progress of the\r\nfight, blow by blow, until the test is decided. The bulletins will be posted thirty seconds after\r\nthey are written in the far Western city\" (Bryant and Holt 2006, 29). This fixation on live updates\r\nfor sporting events across the nation is another example of how sports media has shaped the\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 30\r\nmedia landscape of America. Information began traveling faster than ever via wireless\r\ntransmissions, but it was actually a yacht race which saw one of the very first implementations of\r\nwireless for live information transmission. Sporting events saw some of the earliest uses of the\r\ntelegraph for news reporting as well (Mott 1950, 597). As the telegraph allowed for a sense of\r\nliveness even for remote events, it paved the way for the most significant development in sports\r\nmedia prior to television: radio.\r\nA Fixation on Liveness: Radio and Sports Consumption\r\nRadio delivered on the push towards liveness established by the telegraph. The first\r\nbroadcast of a Major League Baseball game occurred within a year of the commercial release of\r\nradio (Enriquez 2002, 206). Rader remarks, \"Now the fan did not have to await his morning\r\nnewspaper; he instantly shared the drama transpiring on the playing field\" (Rader 1984, 23). For\r\nthe first time, sports were perceived as home entertainment. Broadcasters as well as businesses\r\ncapitalized on the shift. Sports coverage was integral to the rise in popularity of radio in the\r\ninterwar period. In Rader's words,\r\nIn the pre-television era, the heroes of sports assisted the public in coping with a rapidly changing society. The sports world made it possible for Americans to continue to believe in the traditional gospel of success: that hard work, frugality, and loyalty paid dividends; that the individual was potent and could play a large role in shaping his own destiny (1984, 15).\r\nBy Rader's account, sports programming on radio delivered a much needed revitalization\r\nof the American ideals through the transient industrial period and The Great Depression.\r\nThe rise of radio coincides with the golden age of baseball, but there was an awkward\r\ntransitional phase into the new medium while newspapers and radio both tried to define their\r\nnew boundaries. While consumers clearly desired liveness, initial radio broadcasts felt flat and\r\nemotionless (Bryant and Holt 2006, 27). Some of the greatest blow-by-blow sports writers were\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 31\r\nterrible at delivering a compelling radio broadcast. Sports writers were extremely adept at\r\ncreating dramas through print, but they failed to capture audiences in the early days of radio.\r\nOddly enough, their sports knowledge undermined their sports coverage in the new medium.\r\nInstead, a new role emerged: the sportscaster.\r\nIn the era of radio, the performance of live sports broadcasts came with significant stakes.\r\nAdept sportscasters were cherished more for their voices than their sports knowledge. Delivering\r\nplay-by-play depictions of sporting events takes little technical knowledge, instead the\r\nentertainment comes from the delivery. Mandelbaum writes of early radio sportscasters, \"the\r\nbroadcasters were akin to poets and troubadours who preserved and handed down the great tales\r\noftheir cultures by committing them to memory and reciting them publicly\" (2004, 80). Delivery\r\nwas actually so important that sometimes sportscasters such as Graham McNamee, known\r\nespecially for his baseball broadcasts, were not even present at the event but instead handed\r\nwritten play-by-play depictions of the game so that they could add their own dramatic and\r\nauthorial tone to the live event (Mandelbaum 2004).\r\nAnother issue during the emergence of radio was redefining the role of newspaper sports\r\ncoverage. Radio could deliver the liveness desired by sports fans and was incredibly well suited\r\nfor play-by-play commentary. Newspapers had traditionally covered the blow-by-blow report of\r\nan event, capturing the drama through flowery language and hyperbole. With radio, the\r\nsportscaster captured the audience's attention through the same means, bringing in even more\r\nemotion as his voice rose and fell with the action of the contest (Enriquez 2002, 202). Sports\r\nwriters instead decided to focus on an area that radio broadcasters could not: strategy. Early\r\nsportscasters had to focus so much on the delivery of the action that they could not elaborate on\r\nthe reasons behind certain maneuvers. Sports writers took advantage of this deficiency and began\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 32\r\nwriting articles which focused on everything around the action. From in-depth analysis of\r\nstrategy to the creation of larger than life athlete personalities, newspaper coverage of sports in\r\nthe era of radio completely changed to remain relevant.\r\nSports magazines also had to find a new space to occupy during radio's reign.\r\nCompletely unable to keep up with the live coverage by radio and the strategic coverage of\r\nAmerica's favorite sport, baseball, sports magazines instead began to focus on niche sports such\r\nas yacht racing. The other innovation of sports magazines in the early 1930s was their addition of\r\nfull page color photographs of athletes, something that neither radio nor newspapers could offer\r\n(Enriquez 2002, 202). They remained as an important sports medium but had been supplanted by\r\nboth radio and newspapers. Baseball's hold on the American public was so strong that the niche\r\nsports, which were typically covered in sports magazines, hardly seemed relevant. Football in\r\nparticular rarely saw coverage anywhere other than sports magazines (Bryant and Holt 2006, 32).\r\nFootball had traditionally been seen as a college sport reserved for the wealthy, but with an\r\nincreasing number of college graduates in the U.S. and the rise of a new medium, its niche status\r\nwas about to change (Oriard 2014, vii).\r\nThe Televisual Transformation of Sport\r\nTelevision's initial debut into the sports world was a colossal failure. Reaching only a\r\nfew hundred people, the first American televisual sports broadcast was a Columbia-Princeton\r\nbaseball game on May 17, 1939. Just a few years after the commercial release of the television in\r\nthe U.S., RCA's first foray into televised sport flopped. The New York Times' Orrin E. Dunlap Jr.\r\nrecounted on the following Sunday, \"The televiewer lacks freedom; seeing baseball on television\r\nis too confining, for the novelty would not hold up for more than an hour if it were not for the\r\ncommentator\" (Rader 1984, 17). He goes on to say, \"To see the fresh green of the field as The\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 33\r\nMighty Casey advances to the bat, and the dust fly as he defiantly digs in, is a thrill to the eye\r\nthat cannot be electrified and flashed through space on a May day, no matter how clear the air.\"\r\nBryant, Holt, Enriquez, and Rader attribute the failure of early televisual sports to several\r\nfactors. First, television camera technology was rudimentary and receivers were even worse\r\n(Bryant and Holt 2006, 31; Rader 1984, 18). Viewers could hardly see the player, much less\r\nfollow the ball or action on the field. Second, television was not a commercial success upon its\r\nrelease. Sets were expensive and did not offer nearly enough programming to warrant their price:\r\nan issue that created a sort of negative loop as the television industry needed more viewers to\r\nwarrant more content yet could not supply enough content to attract more viewers. The third\r\nfactor, described by Enriquez, is the failure for broadcasters to adapt to the new medium.\r\nSportscasters could not actually see the video feed and casted the game as if they were still on\r\nradio; recounting every single action that occurred on the field despite what was on viewers'\r\nscreens at home. Inexperienced camera operators had difficulty following the action and the\r\nimage rarely matched what the sportscaster was describing.\r\nRadio sportscasters also had difficulty transitioning into the new visual medium because\r\nthey could no longer provide the same level of drama through exaggeration and hyperbole.\r\nWhere short infield ground balls could previously be described as laser-fast bullets, the viewers\r\nat home now saw that the play was just another ordinary event. Situated somewhere in between\r\nwatching the game live at a stadium yet still sounding like radio, televisual sport had a difficult\r\ntime defining itself in the late 1930s and early 1940s. According to Rader, televisual sport\r\nexperimentation stopped completely during the Second World War (1984, 23).\r\nWith the well-established roles of radio, newspapers, and sports magazines, the revival of\r\ntelevisual sport seemed to be impossible. The utter failure of televised sports in the late 1930s\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 34\r\ninto the Second World War left televisual sport in a difficult position. Sports radio's popularity\r\nwas at an all-time high in the 1940s. Baseball had captured the hearts and minds of the American\r\npeople, and famous radio broadcasters such as Bill Stern and Jack Armstrong kept them listening\r\nwith bated breath (Rader 1984, 30-3 1).\r\nBaseball and more generally live event sports spectatorship, however, could not keep the\r\nnation content for too long. In what has been dubbed the Sports Slump of the 1950s by Rader\r\nand others (Bryant and Holt 2006, McChesney 1989), spectatorship had finally started to\r\ndwindle. Television sets were making their way into homes in record numbers after World War\r\n11. In the post-World War 11 era, pastimes shifted from inner-city, public forms of recreation to\r\nprivate, home-centered forms of recreation. Sports revenue was down and change was in the air.\r\nPeople could watch baseball on their television sets at home, but not many people wanted\r\nto. As shown by the earlier quote from The New York Times, television had difficulty containing\r\nthe magic that baseball once held. Football, however, was poised to rise with the new medium. It\r\nhad been long overlooked, but football was incredibly well suited for television broadcasts. The\r\nlarge, visually distinct ball and typically slow moving action provided an acceptable subject for\r\ncontemporary television camera technology (Grano 2014, 13). College football had seen a bit of\r\nsuccess in newspapers, but professional football had a negative reputation as a \"perversion ofthe\r\ncollege game played for alma mater rather than a lousy paycheck\" (Oriard 2014, vii). Radio\r\nbroadcasts of football had never reached the same level of success as baseball.\r\nProfessional football seemed to be a sport without a suitable medium. As sports media\r\nscholar Michael Oriard explains, \"[o]nly television could give the professional game a national\r\naudience, and Pete Rozelle's defining act as the commissioner who ushered in the modem NFL\r\nwas to market the league through a single television contract, rather than leaving clubs to work\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 35\r\nout their own deals\" (2014, vii). This deal with broadcasting giant, NBC, led to the NFL's great\r\nbreakout story and what would soon become the model for televised sports (Rader 1984, 85).\r\nWith the NBC still losing money on a dwindling sports fanbase, they were ready to pull the plug\r\non their deal with the budding NFL until the championship match between the Baltimore Colts\r\nand the New York Giants of 1958 (Grano 2014, 13). This match, still hailed as the 'Greatest\r\nGame Ever Played', would become the longstanding origin story of televised football. The game\r\nwent into a second overtime, pushing the broadcast into prime time on the East Coast, a slot in\r\nwhich NBC never dared to place professional football. As millions of Americans tuned in for\r\ntheir regularly scheduled programming, they instead found John Unitas and his Baltimore Colts\r\nscoring the game winning touchdown after a long, hard-fought battle. Oriard, Rader, Grano,\r\nOates, and Furness all trace the NFL's commercial success to this one defining moment.\r\nAs compelling as origin stories often are, the truth is that many other factors lead to the\r\nsuccess of football in the new mass medium. New technologies such as video tape were integral\r\nto the rise of football in America. Hitchcock argues that instant replay in particular helped with\r\nthe rebranding of professional football: \"The use of video-tape gave the game of football a whole\r\nnew image... The instant replay changed football from brutal, quick collisions into graceful\r\nleaps, tumbles and falls. It gave football an aura of art in movement. It made football attractive to\r\nentirely new segments of the audience\" (1989, 2). Where football players had once been seen as\r\nlethargic brutes, instant replay allowed broadcasters to slow down images, dissect plays, and\r\nhighlight the athleticism of players (Rader 1984, 83-84).\r\nSports, with football leading the charge, were once again on the cutting edge of media\r\nadoption. According to Dylan Mulvin, the first documented use of instant replay for review and\r\ntraining purposes was in 1957 during a game between the Los Angeles Rams and the San\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 36\r\nFrancisco 49ers (2014, 49). By 1964, instant replay was a standard broadcasting technique across\r\nall sports. The NFL's willingness to adapt to the new medium set it apart from other sports at the\r\ntime.\r\nIn addition to these technological and legal advances, Bryant and Holt as well as\r\nMcChesney argue that one particularly innovative producer reinvented sports broadcasting for\r\ntelevision: Roone Arledge. With ABC's full support, Arledge established television broadcasting\r\nconventions still present today. After the 1958 Championship game between the Colts and the\r\nGiants, ABC was scrambling to catch up to the NBC's success in televised sports broadcasting.\r\nAs Enriquez describes, \"Television broadcasting affected different sports in different ways. It\r\ndevastated boxing, had mixed effects on baseball, and proved a boon to college and professional\r\nfootball\" (2002, 202). As NBC began to ride the wave created by the NFL, ABC looked to get in\r\non the action.\r\nArledge was given free rein to perform a complete overhaul of ABC Sports. Bryant and\r\nHolt argue that the single most important innovation Arledge brought was the notion that a\r\ntelevisual broadcast should be presented \"from the perspective of what the typical fan would see\r\nif he or she attended the game live\" (Bryant and Holt 2006, 33). Arledge (2003) believed that the\r\nbroadcast should capture the essence of attending a game, not just the play on the field, but the\r\nroar of the crowd, the cheerleaders, the marching bands, and the coaches on the sidelines. As\r\nEnriquez describes, \"under Arledge, television assumed every role previously played by print\r\nmedia; it served as the primary medium for experiencing events, it provided detailed analysis,\r\nand it gave human faces to the participants\" (2002, 205). Through football, televised sports were\r\nable to set conventions which separated them from earlier forms of media. This transition lives\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 37\r\non in live-streaming today as we will see later with live-streaming's adaptation rather than\r\ntransformation of televised sport.\r\nThe arrival of television meant that sports radio and print media had to redefine their role\r\nin sports coverage. Television could deliver the liveness of radio and, with the help of\r\ncommentators and technology like instant replay, the drama and dissection of strategy found in\r\nprint media. Newspaper coverage of sports was now relegated to simple recaps. Sports\r\nmagazines on the other hand rode the success of television. As Bryant and Holt assert, \"Sports\r\nIllustratedoffers a classic example of an old medium responding to a new one\" (2006, 36).\r\nRather than seeking out an area left uncovered by television, Sports Illustratedsupported\r\ntelevised sports by providing innovative action photography and updates on the most popular\r\nathletes and teams at the time.\r\nSports broadcasts of the 1960s were infused with the hopes and fears of the Cold War\r\nera. R. Powers, a television sports scholar, suggests that sports filled a void in the American\r\npublic, \"shrugging off the darker morbidities of the Cold War and McCarthyism\" (1984, 118).\r\nThe re-found focus on sports as spectacle established by \"the youthful theme of ABC, echoed the\r\nKennedy idealism of the new frontier, the sporting emphasis echoed Kennedy's image of\r\nmuscular athleticism...\" (Whannel 2002, 34). Entertainment sports media, with its art-in-motion\r\npresentation, delivered a message of newness and regeneration to American.\r\nThrough broadcasting and advertising deals, sports helped build and perpetuate the\r\ngrowing conspicuous consumption movement and the capitalist ideals of post-war America.\r\nAthletes resumed their star status. Sports stars began appearing in advertising everywhere.\r\nMerchandising became a key part of sports promotion. Anything from replica jerseys of sports\r\nstars to blankets and flags with team branding can be found almost anywhere in the U.S.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 38\r\nContemporary Sports fandom has come to mean much more than simply following a team. It\r\nmeans buying a team's products, playing sports video games, joining fantasy leagues, and\r\nwatching sports entertainment television. Oates, a sports media scholar focused on the NFL,\r\nwrites that fandom has been transformed by the presentation of athletes as commodities to be\r\nconsumed selectively and self-consciously by sports fans (2014, 80). The previously subcultural\r\nhyper-fandom activities such as fantasy football and sports video games, Oates argues, have\r\nmoved into mainstream prominence and profitability. Fans are invited to interact with athletes as\r\nvicarious managers in fantasy sports, offering a completely new, personally tailored form of\r\ninteraction with sports organizations. This new drive for constant connection and feedback\r\nwithin the sports industry culminates with live-streaming.\r\nLive-Streaming: Constant Connection\r\nAs Oates suggests, sports fandom has fundamentally changed to reflect an increased\r\ninvolvement on the part of the spectator. Athletes and personalities have become commodities\r\nfor fans to interact with. Social media, fantasy sports, and video games have created a connection\r\nto sports stars that was never before available in other media. At any moment, a spectator can\r\ncatch highlights on ESPN, head over to forums to discuss major sporting events, or load a stream\r\nof a match on their phone, all while tweeting at their favorite athletes with the expectation that\r\ntheir words will be received on the other end.\r\nRecent trends show a change in the sports media landscape as new platforms begin to vie\r\nfor control over sports broadcasting in the US. The NFL has recently signed a deal with Google\r\nallowing for the streaming of games over the internet after their current contract with DirecTV\r\nends in 2015. This deal reflects the changing media landscape in the internet era. The rise of new\r\nstreaming platforms poses an interesting dilemma to the current media titans and new\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 39\r\nopportunities for new forms of media sports. Thus far, using the tradition established by\r\nMcChesney, Bryant, Holt, and Rader among others, I have used sports media as a lens through\r\nwhich to view particular socio-cultural moments in America. I now turn that lens towards the\r\ncontemporary sports media landscape. What can we learn about our own social moment by\r\nlooking at the use of streaming platforms for traditional sports or the arrival of e-sports as an\r\nentirely new form of professional competition that makes use of older forms of media, but\r\nthrives in live-streams and video on demand?\r\nThe MLB offers an early case study into the use of live-streaming for major league sports\r\nbroadcasting. The regular season in the MLB consists of 2,430 games, a staggering number\r\ncompared to the NFL's 256. The sheer number of regular season games held each year causes a\r\nproblem with over-saturation. This inundation of content lowers the value of each individual\r\ngame in the eyes of the major networks (Mondelo 2006, 283). The games that these networks\r\nchoose not to air due to scheduling conflicts previously caused many games to go unseen by fans\r\noutside of the local media market for the two competing teams. To remedy the situation, the\r\nMLB streamed over 1,000 regular season games online starting in 2003. The launch of MLB.tv\r\nin 2002 allowed engaged MLB fans to continue watching content even when they did not have\r\naccess to the games through the major networks. While not initially a huge commercial success,\r\nMLB.tv still runs today, over a decade later at a monthly subscription of $19.99 and as of 2014\r\nincorporated both post-season games and the World Series as part of the package (MLB.tv\r\n2015). While the MLB has not released the official revenue totals for its live-streaming service,\r\nwith 3.7 million subscribers the platform generates well over $400 million per year (MLB.tv\r\n2013). This little-known use of live-streaming shows a hunger for immediate interaction with\r\nsports media regardless of the available medium.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 40\r\nEarly live-streaming fundamentally looks and feels like television, but it filled a role\r\nwhich network television could not: all access and constant connection to media. It took form on\r\na new platform, but did not truly differ from television. Early live-streaming is more like an\r\nadaptation of television than a new medium. Rather than creating something new, the early foray\r\ninto live-streaming by the MLB simply adapted the already present broadcasting infrastructure\r\nand applied it through a different avenue. Television is often invoked in live-streaming. If we\r\nlook at MLB.tv, the .tv signifies its connection to television, but that domain is actually the\r\nofficial domain for the country of Tuvalu. Other streaming platforms like ustream.tv, twitch.tv,\r\nMLG.tv, all based outside of Tuvalu, use the same domain to signal their televisual connection.\r\nLive-streaming emerged at a very particular moment in the evolution of sports media.\r\nWith air-time limited on the major networks, the internet allows a near infinite amount of content\r\nto reach sports fans. As Oates would argue, from fantasy sports, to blogs, to live-streaming, the\r\ninternet is, for many, the new space of the sports fan. Live-streaming goes beyond the ability of\r\nother media to reach viewers wherever and whenever, whether from a home computer or a\r\nmobile device. Live-streaming delivers on the constant connectedness expected by consumers\r\ntoday. At its roots, live-streaming is a televisual medium. So what separates it from television?\r\nLive-streaming today has created its own niche by blending other forms of media. Most\r\nlive-streams host an internet relay chat (IRC) in addition to the audiovisual component of the\r\nbroadcast. This IRC allows viewers to chat with other audience members and often the\r\nbroadcaster, a functionality not currently available in television. This live audience connection in\r\nlive-streaming is unparalleled in television. Hamilton et al., in their investigation of the\r\nsignificance of live-streaming for community creation, situate Twitch streams as an important\r\n'third place' for community. Building on the work of both Oldenberg and McLuhan, Hamilton et\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 41\r\nal. (2014) suggest that \"By combining hot and cool media, streams enable the sharing of rich\r\nephemeral experiences in tandem with open participation through informal social interaction, the\r\ningredients for a third place.\" The third place that the authors point to creates a rich connection\r\nakin to interpersonal interaction. The ephemeral nature of these interactions creates a deep sense\r\nof community even in streams with hundreds of thousands of viewers. Live-streaming and in\r\nturn, the IRC associated with streams creates a shared experience tantamount to the \"roar of a\r\nstadium\" (Hamilton et al. 2014). These streams also pull in a global audience, connecting\r\nisolated audiences into one hyper-connected community. Live-streaming draws on television for\r\nits look and feel, but delivers not only on the desire for liveness perpetuated in sports media but\r\nalso the hyper-connectivity present in today's globalized world.\r\nE-sports, Live-streaming, and Sports Media\r\nMany factors contributed to the success of live-streaming for e-sports. It arrived at a\r\nmoment when television seemed closed to e-sports, it was much less expensive to produce, and\r\nmuch easier to cultivate. Television broadcasts are prohibitively expensive to produce. Early\r\nattempts at airing e-sports on television have typically flopped, rarely surviving past a second\r\nseason. E-sports are difficult to film when compared to traditional sports and conventions had\r\nnot yet been set for the televisual presentation of e-sports (Taylor 2012). The action in traditional\r\nsports can typically be captured by one shot. E-sports broadcasts, in contrast, must synthesize\r\none cohesive narrative out many different player viewpoints with varying levels of information.\r\nIn a game like CounterStrike, broadcasters must wrangle with a large map with ten players in\r\nfirst-person perspective. The resulting audiovisual feed is a frantic attempt to capture the most\r\nrelevant information from the players with an outside 'observer' controlling another viewpoint\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 42\r\nremoved from the players' point of view. The observer functionality in the early days of e-sports\r\nbroadcasting created a difficult barrier to overcome for commercial success on television.\r\nObserver functionality had not yet become a focus for game developers and commentary had not\r\nreached the level of competency it has in more contemporary broadcasts.\r\nInstead of finding success on television, e-sports pulls in millions of concurrent viewers\r\non live-streaming sites such as Twitch.tv. With television seemingly out of reach and streaming\r\nrequiring significant investment per event in the early 2000's, e-sports broadcasting remained\r\nrelatively stagnant until the arrival of a reliable, and cheap, live-streaming platform. Justin.tv\r\n(and other similar sites like UStream and Stickam), which launched in 2007, delivered exactly\r\nwhat e-sports broadcasters needed to grow. The site allowed users to quickly and easily stream\r\ncontent online with the use of some relatively simple software. Both broadband internet reach\r\nand streaming technology had developed to a point that lowered the barrier of entry for\r\nbroadcasters. Players from around the world streamed games from their bedrooms. E-sports\r\nbroadcasters reached new, massive audiences.\r\nThe success of gaming content on Justin.tv spurred a new streaming site dedicated solely\r\nto gaming. The games-centered streaming site, Twitch.tv, launched in 2011. Twitch.tv\r\nrevolutionized the e-sports industry. Each of the casters I interviewed spent time detailing the\r\nimportance of Twitch.tv without being prompted. As one explained, Twitch.tv is \"the clearest\r\ndriving factor that's grown e-sports over the past 2-3 years.\" As mentioned in the introduction, e-\r\nsports audiences have reached previously unheard of levels. Large scale e-sports events regularly\r\nsee concurrent viewer numbers in the hundreds of thousands. These broadcasts still largely\r\nresemble televised sports however, rarely, if ever, making use of the IRC.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n43\r\nLive-streaming is just one of the forms of media the e-sports industry makes use of. In\r\nfact, e-sports interacts with most media in the same ways that traditional sports have. The e-\r\nsports industry pushes back into almost all of the earlier forms of media discussed in this chapter.\r\nPrint and radio typically fill a PR role in e-sports coverage. Large events or developments often\r\nmake their way into publications like The New York Times. Local radio segments will\r\noccasionally feature summaries of e-sports events occurring nearby. Internet versions of both of\r\nprint and radio sports coverage are fundamental segments of the e-sports media ecosystem.\r\nPodcasts, digital audio files available on the internet through downloads or streaming, vlogs, and\r\nvideo diaries fill essentially the same role for e-sports that radio currently plays for traditional\r\nsports. Experts weigh in on recent developments and players breakdown certain aspects of a\r\ngame.\r\nE-sports journalism has also immerged as a legitimizing force within the industry. Sites\r\nlike ongamers.com and esportsheaven.com keep fans abreast of any new developments in the\r\nprofessional scene for all of the major e-sports titles. Journalists like Richard Lewis add\r\nlegitimacy to e-sports through their coverage of current events. Their recaps of developments as\r\nwell as summaries of various tournaments and leagues closely resemble their print counterparts\r\nin sports coverage. It is clear that the e-sports industry is in conversation with many forms of\r\nmedia. Many of the forms and techniques are borrowed directly from sports coverage. These\r\nforms of media did not appear instantly however, they are the result of years of push and pull\r\nwith the larger sports media landscape. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the commentating\r\nof e-sports live-streams.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n44\r\nChapter 2\r\nShoutcasters Collecting Conventions\r\nE-sportscasters, often referred to as shoutcasters, both look and sound like professional\r\nsportscasters. Their attire and cadence both create an instant connection to televisual sports.\r\nHaving never seen a game of Starcraft 2 before, you may watch the flashing lights and\r\nexplosions with a perplexed look on your face. As you continue to watch, you hear two\r\ncommentators provide a narrative, stats fly across the screen, and you start to piece together the\r\ngame in front of you. After a few minutes, you know the two players who are facing off against\r\none another, you feel the excitement as they engage each other's armies, and a slight sting as the\r\nplayer you were rooting for concedes the match with a polite \"GG.\" The whole presentation feels\r\nlike a variant of Monday Night Football with virtual armies instead of football teams. From the\r\nstat-tickers to the sound of the commentator's voice, you can almost imagine the ESPN or CBS\r\nlogo gracing the bottom corner of the screen. Shoutcasters have become a staple in e-sports. One\r\nof the main signifiers of the 'sports' moniker professional gaming has taken on, shoutcasters lend\r\nan air of professionalism to a scene which often struggles to define itself. By adopting the 'sport'\r\ntitle, a precedent has been set for e-sports broadcasters which informs their style and\r\nconventions.\r\nShoutcasters are important to investigate because they form a fundamental grounding for\r\ne-sports which helps it to create its identity in the face of blistering turnover rates and constant\r\nfield shifts. E-sports stand in a unique position compared to traditional sports. Where players and\r\ncoaches in traditional sports often have careers that last for several years, e-sports personalities\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 45\r\nsuffer from intense turnover rates where professional careers can end within a year. E-sports\r\nplayers burn out quickly and coaches rarely make a lasting name in the industry. The\r\nrecognizable personalities in e-sports are the few innovators and commentators who turned their\r\npassion into a career. In this chapter, I analyze the role of shoutcasters within the larger\r\nframework of the e-sports industry. I build much of this analysis on the foundation that Taylor\r\n(2012) established in her investigation of the rise of e-sports. Much of Taylor's analysis still\r\nholds true today, but some other developments in the field have created new dynamics within\r\nshoutcasting that were not present during her initial encounters with shoutcasters. Understanding\r\nhow shoutcasters borrow from earlier forms of media, the issues they perceive within the\r\nindustry, and how they cultivate their own identity as shoutcasters while grappling with the\r\nhyper-connection found in live-streaming as a medium allows us to grasp the relationship e-\r\nsports broadcasting has with earlier forms of media while still creating its own identity. I begin\r\nwith a very brief look at the history of shoutcasting.\r\nShoutcasting History\r\nOne can see that even early attempts at broadcasting competitive gaming borrowed\r\nheavily from its media contemporaries. Starcade,a 1982 show that ran for two years, marks one\r\nof the first forays into e-sports broadcasting. Though the term e-sports had not yet emerged, the\r\nshow featured two opponents attempting to outscore each other on various arcade machines. If\r\nwe look to Starcade as an early example of e-sports, then the origins of e-sports commentating\r\nresemble game show commentary found in Jeapordy! or The Price is Right. Watching Starcade\r\nfor the hosting alone reveals many similarities to other game shows: the host wears typical game-\r\nshow host garb, pleasantly explains every aspect of the competition, and speaks with the\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 46\r\nbroadcast voice we all recognize. Starcadealso shows the constant evolution of competitive\r\ngaming coverage as it continued to refine its camera angles, presentation, and format over its two\r\nyear run.\r\nThe model which more closely resembles our modern vision of shoutcasting gained\r\nmomentum at the turn of the twenty-first century. The title shoutcaster comes from the early\r\nstreaming software used for e-sports broadcasting, SHOUTcast. While many people familiar\r\nwith e-sports may have no idea where the term comes from, a prominent shoutcaster, djWHEAT\r\n(2012), claims that the title remains due to its signaling of the history of e-sports. SHOUTcast, a\r\nmedia streaming program, arrived in 1998, allowing interested parties to broadcast audio\r\nrecordings to various 'radio' channels for free. SHOUTcast allowed for video streaming, but as\r\none early shoutcaster I interviewed lamented, the bandwidth and equipment required for video\r\nstreaming was prohibitively expensive.\r\nInstead of the audiovisual broadcast we regularly associate with e-sports live-streams\r\ntoday, early shoutcasters relied on audio recordings akin to early radio coverage of traditional\r\nsports. These early broadcasts only streamed audio to a few hundred dedicated fans on internet\r\nradio. Early shoutcasts follow the form of traditional play-by-play radio broadcasts, focused\r\nprimarily on presenting every development in the game. In interviews, veteran shoutcasters were\r\nnot shy about admitting the influence radio sportscasters had on their own style. One mentioned\r\nthat he spent hours listening to live sports radio to hone his own skills.\r\nEarly shoutcasters also performed many aspects of the production that they are no longer\r\nrequired to perform in the more mature e-sports industry. They would attend events, set up their\r\nown station, typically with their own laptop and microphone. It was a very grassroots affair.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 47\r\nWith little experience in the technical aspects of broadcasting, the productions emulated as much\r\nas they could from sports broadcasting to lend an air of professionalism.\r\nWith the arrival of Twitch.tv, and other reliable streaming platforms, much of the onus of\r\nproduction was taken off of shoutcasters. Instead of acting as producers, directors, editors, and\r\non-air talent all at once as they had in the early audio-only streams, shoutcasters are now more\r\nable to focus on the portion of their work from which they get their name. Shoutcasting after the\r\nearly days of internet radio has come to not only sound like traditional sportscasting, but also\r\nlook like traditional sportscasting.\r\nSomething Borrowed: Influences from Sportscasting\r\nWardrobe\r\nMany ofthe shoutcasters I interviewed talked about wardrobe as a huge change within\r\nshoutcasting, one that was spurred entirely by looking at traditional sportscasting. Most\r\nshoutcasters got their start wearing t-shirts and jeans at various e-sports events. Today, you will\r\nrarely find a shoutcaster not wearing a shirt with a blazer. Looking at the image below shows the\r\nincredible shift in shoutcasting just within the last six years. Both images feature the same\r\nFigure 2-Left: Joe Miller at 2009 Intel Friday Game London; Right: Joe Miller at 2015 Intel Extreme Masters World Championship in Katowice Poland. Image credit: ESL, Philip Soedler and Helena Kristiansson. Flickr.com/eslphotos\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n48\r\nshoutcaster: Joe Miller. The left-hand image comes from the 2009 Intel Friday Game London\r\nwhile the right-hand image comes from the 2015 Intel Extreme Masters World Championship.\r\nWhile the images are quite similar, the professionalism apparent in the right-hand image\r\nresembles a professional sportscaster. The gamer/geek vibe found in the left-hand image has\r\nbeen removed from the shoutcasting image. As a few of the shoutcasters I spoke with admitted,\r\nthe drive to rework the shoutcaster wardrobe came purely from traditional sports. On top of that,\r\nthey pointed to a desire to shed the gamer/geek stereotypes that e-sports had come to inhabit. By\r\nadopting professional attire, they felt that they could get rid of the old image and emulate the\r\nprofessionalism of a sports broadcast. Wardrobe is not the only aspect of traditional sportscasting\r\nthat has made its way into shoutcasting.\r\nStyle\r\nOne of the more elusive aspects borrowed from traditional sports is the actual\r\ncommentary style. I use the term elusive here to signal the difficulty in pinning down exactly\r\nwhy shoutcasters remind us so vividly of traditional sportscasters. Early shoutcasters had no\r\nmodels outside of traditional sportscasting so they took as much as they could: \"So as a\r\nbroadcaster we look at traditional sportscasting. We pull from that and then make sure it fits in\r\ngame casting.\" As it turns out, many sports commentary conventions translate well into game\r\ncasting. As such, the first generation of casters share many similarities with television\r\nsportscasters. Most of these early shoutcasters admit to being influenced almost entirely by\r\ntraditional sportscasters. One caster explains, \"Television is where we grew up, it's what we\r\nwatched. So clearly that's where we're going to pull from.\"\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n49\r\nShoutcasters typically have no media training, instead relying on mimicry of earlier\r\nconventions to get by. As with most positions in e-sports, and similar to early sports writers and\r\nradio casters, shoutcasters are just passionate fans turned professional. In conversations, they\r\neach revealed a bit of their own personal history that pushed them towards broadcasting, but only\r\none ever mentioned having received any sort of formal training. Years into his shoutcasting\r\ncareer, he \"went back and did a journalism and broadcasting course for 6-9 months.\" Of\r\nparticular note, he mentions, \"they did one really good project which was 'how to be a news\r\npresenter'. They taught me the basics of that.\" The rest, he says, he learned on-air through\r\nexperience. The other shoutcasters I interviewed echoed this story.\r\nMost of the shoutcasters I interviewed fell into shoutcasting through happenstance and\r\nhad to learn their craft on-air. Shoutcasters are akin to the very early television sportscasters who\r\nhad to reinvent their style during broadcasts like Bob Stanton, a radio sportscaster turned\r\ntelevision sportscaster who would send his friends to sports bars to gather feedback and\r\nsuggestions from audience members (Rader 1984). Echoing this inexperience and improvisation,\r\none shoutcaster I interviewed confided, \"the first time I had ever been on camera, I sat down and\r\nI was like, 'I have no idea how to do this.' I had done two and a half years of audio casting, but I\r\nhad never done video.\" Another caster recalls of his first show, \"All I knew going into my first\r\nbroadcast was that I know this game. I know how it works, I know these players, and I play\r\nagainst these kinds of players. I don't know how commentary works, but I can do this.\" After\r\nthese first, trial broadcasts, both of the above-mentioned shoutcasters admitted to going back and\r\nwatching traditional sportscasters to learn more about their craft.\r\nOther broadcasting style conventions such as how to handle dead-air, how to end a\r\nsegment, or how to transition into gameplay were lifted directly from sportscasting. Paul\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n50\r\n\"ReDeYe\" Chaloner, a prominent personality within the e-sports industry, addresses each of\r\nthese techniques in his primer on becoming a professional shoutcaster, constantly pointing to various examples from traditional sports broadcasting to illustrate his points. In his section on dead-air, Chaloner writes, \"[o]ne of the best pieces of advice I had for TV was from legendary\r\nsports producer Mike Burks (11 time Emmy award winner for sports production) who told me 'A\r\ngreat commentator knows when to shut up and say nothing\"' (2009, 9). Chaloner uses traditional\r\nsports broadcasting as a way to explain shoutcasting, a clear indication of its influence on e-\r\nsports broadcasting.\r\nContent Analysis: Play-by-play and Color Commentary in the NFL andLCS\r\nAnother convention lifted directly from traditional sports broadcasts is the arrangement\r\nof the casting team. Traditional television sportscasters fall into one of two roles: play-by-play or\r\ncolor commentary. Shoutcasters use these same two roles. Both sports broadcasts and e-sports\r\nbroadcasts feature one of each type. The play-by-play commentator narrates the action, putting\r\ntogether the complicated and unconnected segments of the game into a cohesive narrative. The\r\ncolor commentator provides their in-depth analysis of the game, typically from the stance of a professional player.\r\nShoutcasters have adopted the two-person team directly from traditional sports\r\nbroadcasts. The path to each role follows the same pattern as well. An ex-professional player\r\nalmost always fills the role of color commentary in both traditional sports and e-sports. Their\r\ninsight is unparalleled. Color commentators attempt to breakdown complex series of events or\r\nhighly technical maneuvers as if they were still a professional player. In the words of one e-\r\nsports color commentator, \"I'm not pretending to be a professional player, but I'm doing my best\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n51\r\nto emulate them.\" He goes on to say, \"You can read up on it and study it as much as you like, but unless you've lived it, you can't really comment on it.\" In comparison, a play-by-play\r\ncommentator does not need to have the technical depth, but relies more on presentation. Even\r\nthough a play-by-play commentator has most likely played hundreds of hours of whichever game\r\nthey cast, they cannot fill the role of the color commentator. This dynamic allows for play-by-\r\nplay commentators to switch games with relative ease whereas color commentators, both in\r\ntraditional sports and e-sports, are locked into one game.\r\nTo illustrate the emulation of sports broadcasting found in e-sports, I now turn to a brief\r\ncontent analysis of the commentary found in a regular season NFL game and a regular season\r\nLeague of Legends Championship Series game. I start with the commentary from one play in an\r\nNFL game. After presenting the traditional model, I move to the commentary from one team\r\nfight in League of Legends to demonstrate how the convention has been adapted for e-sports\r\ncommentary. In both cases, I have removed the names of players, commentators, and teams to\r\ncut down on jargon and clutter. Each case exhibits the dynamic present in the two man\r\ncommentary team.\r\nNFL\r\nWith both teams lined up, the play begins and the play-by-play commentator comes in immediately.\r\nPlay-by-play: Here's [player 1] out to midfield, a yard shy of a first down. [player 2] on the tackle.\r\nAfter the play has ended, the color commentator takes over.\r\nColor: It's been [team 1] on both sides of the ball. Whether it be defense and the way that they dominated this ball game and then offensively, the early going had\r\nthe interception, didn't get much going over the next couple of possessions offensively but since that time, [player 3] has been very precise in how he has thrown the football and they just attacked this defense every which way.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n52\r\nLCS\r\nThree members ofthe Red Team engage Blue Team atRed Team's turret\r\nPlay-by-play: This is going to be dangerous. Doing what he can to hold out. They're going to grab the turret, the fight will continue after the shield onto [player 1] is already broken. He gets hit, the ignite is completely killing the\r\nultimate! He gets hit by [player 2] who turns around again and heads back to [player 3].\r\nWith the action overfor the moment, the colorcommentatorbegins to speak\r\nColor: I thought he finished a camp here too...\r\nThe color commentatoris cut off as two more members ofBlue Team attempt to attack.\r\nPlay-by-Play Heyo, as the top side comes in here too. [player 1], will he hit a good ultimate!? Oh! They were staring right at him but now he's just left to get shredded apart here. They couldn't have thought that this was going to go well for them.\r\nWith thefightconcluded, thecolorcommentatorcontinuesagain.\r\nColor: Is this just the week of chaos? Because that was a really really uncharacteristic lapse in judgement from [Blue Team]: Not calling everybody into\r\nposition at the right time, and [Red Team] with the advantage make them pay for it. They didn't expect the ignite from Nautilus. I think they expected Nautilus to\r\nhave exhaust instead, but [player 1] pops the ignite, and as we said there is no armor so [player 2] just... and it continues!\r\nThe color commentator is cut off once again as the two teams engage one another for a third time.\r\nIf we look at these examples for their content rather than the specific moment in the game we can\r\ncatch a full illustration of the two-caster dynamic. As we can see by the NFL example, the play-\r\nby-play commentator provides a running narration of the action in the game. When the action\r\nends, the color commentator provides the meta-level analysis of the unfolding events. In the LCS\r\nexample, we see that the same dynamic is present, however, due to the continuous action in the\r\ngame, the transition into color commentary becomes difficult. In the first lull, the LCS color\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n53\r\ncommentator tries to insert his analysis, but he is cut off by a second engagement. The color\r\ncommentator stops talking immediately and allows the play-by-play commentator to continue\r\ndescribing the action. After the engagement ends, we hear the color commentator pick up again, explaining why the fight developed the way it did as well as his insight into why the teams played the way they did.\r\nEntertainment and Narrative\r\nEntertainment value was a repeated concept in my interviews with shoutcasters. Some\r\nwent so far as to claim that their role was only to entertain. One stated, \"I want to get you\r\nexcited. I want to get you to watch the game as if it was a show on television.\" Many would\r\npoint to good sportscasters as an example to follow. If we recall the example of the early days of\r\nradio sportscasting, casters had a difficult time making the transition to the new medium. Their\r\nbroadcasts felt flat when compared with their print counterparts (Bryant and Holt 2006, 27).\r\nEarly sportscasters got locked into the idea that their responsibility was to provide the basic play-\r\nby-play depiction of a match. The golden age of sports radio was brought in by popular\r\nsportscasters, such as Graham McNamee, who were so popular that they'd be asked to cast\r\ngames remotely. McNamee, like a live version of his print counterparts, was famous for creating\r\nflorid depictions of the game, athletes became heroes and their play became combat as told by\r\nMcNamee. While the presentation of live and accurate information was still essential, popular\r\nradio sportscasters shifted sports media from news reports to entertainment. Sportscasters are\r\nresponsible for this shift. Without their expert embellishment, play-by-play depictions lack\r\nentertainment value.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n54\r\nEven non-sports fans can feel the excitement from a particularly good sportscaster. The\r\ngame they portray is far more intriguing than any actual events happening on the field (Bryant,\r\nBrown, Comisky, and Zillmann 1982). This disconnect forms one of the primary reasons that the\r\ntransition to casting televised sport was so difficult. The small liberties that sportscasters took\r\nwere no longer acceptable in the visual medium. Once the home viewer could see the game,\r\ncommentary had to shift to accommodate more scrutiny. Radio sportscasters were notorious for\r\ntheir embellishment. As Bryant, Comisky, and Zillman note from one of their several\r\ninvestigations of sportscasting, roughly forty percent of commentary is dramatic embellishment\r\n(1977). In 1977, the authors tracked the amount of hyperbole and exaggeration in sports\r\nbroadcasting and found that over half of the speech was dedicated to drama. E-sports\r\nshoutcasters, by comparison, rarely use dramatic embellishment of action. A few of the\r\ninformants noted that they feel that embellishing actions is not possible due to their audience.\r\nThe e-sports audience as pictured by shoutcasters, includes mostly dedicated players.\r\nWhile many sports fans may play their sport casually, e-sports fans engage with the games they\r\nwatch regularly. As one shoutcaster explains, \"we've only ever gone out to a hardcore audience.\"\r\nHe acknowledges that the current audience is in flux, but the primary base of e-sports fans are\r\nintensely dedicated viewers and players. Because of this dynamic, shoutcasters feel that\r\nembellishment of the actions on screen would be difficult to slip past a discerning eye. Their\r\nbelief that dramatic embellishment isn't possible may say more about their understanding of\r\ntraditional sports fans than it does about their formulation of their role as commentators. While\r\nunacknowledged in interviews, the possibility for shoutcasters to add embellishment exists. Their\r\nchoice not to use embellishment speaks more to their formulation of the e-sports audience than it\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n55\r\ndoes to their casting quality. Instead of embellishment of action, shoutscasters rely on another\r\nconvention found in traditional sportscasting: narrative.\r\nStudies that focus on the media effects of sportscasting suggest that sportscasters\r\nfundamentally alter the audience perception of the telecast through story-telling and narrative\r\n(Krein and Martin 2006). Sportscasters take many liberties in their descriptions of the game to\r\nadd a dramatic flair. In several empirical studies, Bryant, Brown, Comisky, and Zillman (1979)\r\nfound that when sportscasters created a narrative of animosity between players, viewers felt an\r\nincreased amount of tension and engagement. They conclude that the narrative scope of the\r\nsportscaster is critical in the perception of sports broadcasting. This narrative creation has bled\r\ninto shoutcasting as many shoutcasters attempt to amplify the emotional content of their games\r\nby highlighting underdog stories or hyping up animosity between players. One caster I\r\ninterviewed connected his work to the narrative creation in sports commentary by stating,\r\n\"Emotion is one of the key words in commentary. You need to be able to connect a certain\r\nemotion to the words you're saying. You need to be able to make someone scared for their\r\nfavorite player or overjoyed when they win. Create greatest enemies. You need to be able to\r\nmake these feelings through what you say or how you say it. Emotion is everything.\" This caster\r\ngoes to great lengths to dig up statistics from previous matchups to provide a narrative for the\r\nmatch he casts. Through this investigation, the shoutcaster is able to contextualize a match with a\r\nrich history. Perhaps two players have met three times before and each time the result has been\r\nthe same. Will viewers be able to share in the momentous victory of the underdog? As part of\r\ntheir preparation, shoutcasters will research all of the previous meetings between two players to\r\ncreate a history between them, a tactic which they acknowledge has been used in traditional\r\nsports for decades.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n56\r\nProduction\r\nStream production is another realm where e-sports have started to borrow heavily. While\r\ne-sports producers may have gotten a head start on streaming live events, they often rely on the\r\nexpertise of television producers to put a show together. Multiple shoutcasters pointed to a\r\nsteady influx of television producers making their way into e-sports, \"the way we approach a\r\nproduction is very much like television. A lot of the production guys that are getting into it are\r\nfrom television.\" In fact, the executive producer of the League of Legends Championship Series, an immensely popular e-sports program, is former emmy-winner Ariel Horn. Horn won his Emmy as an associate producer of the 2004 Olympics for NBC. Likewise, Mike Burks, executive producer for the Championship Gaming Series mentioned in the above quote from Paul Chaloner, had an immense amount of experience in televised sports before migrating to e- sports. These are just two of the many experienced television producers making their way into e- sports. Their style is beginning to show as e-sports events become more polished every year. If we recall the image of Prime Time League in the introduction to this thesis, we can see the influx of television conventions in e-sports from the production side. The shoutcasters benefit from the experience of working with television producers to refine their style. As the field has grown, however, we begin to see minor tweaks in style and delivery. Spending a significant time with e- sports casting, in comparison with sportscasting, reveals several distinctions. Much of this difference comes with the age of the field, but just as Starcadeevolved over its short lifespan, shoutcasters have found ways to make themselves unique. Their understanding of their role within the overall e-sports industry informs us of some of the key differences here.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n57\r\nSomething New: Shoutcaster Identity\r\nShoutcasters are situated somewhere between fan and professional. As evidenced by the\r\nabove investigation of how shoutcasters are informed by their traditional predecessors, the role\r\nof shoutcasters is still very much in flux. Shoutcasters are just recently creating their own\r\nidentity separate from their sportscasting roots. In particular, the less experienced shoutcasters I\r\nspoke with use markedly different models to inform their own casting.\r\nThe Second Generation of Professional Shoutcasters\r\nA second generation of casters is just now coming into the scene. Instead of looking to\r\ntraditional sportscasters as their models, they emulate veteran shoutcasters: \"my influences are\r\nthe streamers that I watched. I watched everyone who casts and commentates...my commentary\r\nstyle comes from those guys. I don't know how much is conscious or just mimicry.\" This new\r\ncaster has been on the scene for only a fraction of the time that the veterans have. In that time he\r\nhas honed his shoutcasting skills not by finding sports commentary and seeing which aspects\r\napply to shoutcasting, but by absorbing as much information as he could from other shoutcasters.\r\nAnother fresh shoutcaster offers a fascinating disconnect from the older casters: \"I definitely\r\nbounce off more e-sportscasters than sports. I just watch more e-sports than sports. Sports are so\r\ndifferent than e-sports, there's so little that I can actually use from them.\" Where his\r\npredecessors admit to borrowing primarily from traditional sportscasters, this new generation has\r\nleft the realm of traditional sportscasting behind.\r\nThe professional casters provide material for an amateur level of shoutcasters to pull\r\nfrom. The shoutcasters I interviewed were all professionals who typically work on major events\r\nwith massive support and budgets. With a robust network of shoutcasters to pull from, however,\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n58\r\nwe may see much more support for the grassroots level of e-sports that many early fans are\r\naccustomed to. Current shoutcasters also provide a model for potential careers. Through the\r\nhard-fought struggle of years-worth of unpaid events, the shoutcasters I spoke with have created\r\na legitimate profession worth pursuing. Most warned me that the path is no longer as easy as they\r\nonce had it. Most of them pursued shoutcasting for the love of e-sports. They had years to\r\nfumble through persona creation, broadcast techniques, and conventions.\r\nNew, potential shoutcasters are automatically held to a higher standard. A senior caster\r\noffered the following advice, \"With how casting has changed, you need to be open to casting\r\nmultiple games. You have to be willing to learn. There is a lot we can teach a caster, but you\r\nhave to have some skills within you alone. You have to have some camera presence.\" The\r\nmention of camera presence signals a significant jump from early shoutcasting. Just a few years\r\nago, the shoutcasters I interviewed sat down in front of a camera for the first time armed with\r\nnothing but game knowledge; camera presence was a foreign word to them.\r\nPerhaps the most significant change to casters is their overall level of experience. Some\r\nof the shoutcasters I spoke with have been broadcasting for over a decade. Time has allowed\r\nthese casters to experiment and find their own style. As mentioned earlier, many of the minutia\r\ninvolved in running a show take time to learn. Most casters got their start casually. They may\r\nhave been passionate about e-sports and created a role for themselves within the industry. Some\r\nare former players who made the hard decision to give up on their hopes of winning big to\r\ninstead cultivate a community.\r\nAs new professionals, shoutcasters are just now coming together with the support of e-\r\nsports companies under legitimate full-time contracts. The professional casters I spoke with all\r\nacknowledged a significant change in their commentary since making the transition into full-time\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n59\r\ncasting with other casters around for feedback and training. One explained that he had never\r\nbeen sure how to handle dead-air, moments when both casters are silent and there is little action\r\nin the game. Through feedback sessions with other casters, he learned that there are some\r\nappropriate times to let the viewer formulate their own opinions on the match. Heeding the\r\nadvice of veteran casters like Paul Chaloner, he went on to explain that one of the problems he\r\nsees in shoutcasting more generally is that shoutcasters are afraid to just be quiet during a stream.\r\nPart of the emotional build-up of a game, he explains, is letting the natural flow of a game take\r\nits course without any input from the casters.\r\nIt will be fascinating to watch as these expert networks inform e-sports broadcasts across\r\nthe world. One informant remarked, \"Now that we're all working together, we're learning a lot\r\noff of one another, which hasn't happened in commentary before.\" Beyond allowing veteran\r\nshoutcasters to compare notes, the professional status of shoutcasting provides training to new\r\nshoutcasters. One veteran claimed, \"All the junior people are learning so much faster than we\r\never did. They're taking everything we learned over 5-10 years and doing it in months.\" These\r\nveteran casters can now pass on their experience and their style. Techniques like hand-offs at the\r\nend of a segment or transitions from the desk to gameplay often came up in my interviews as\r\nissues which take years to learn, but newer shoutcasters are able to pick these cues up from\r\nearlier shoutcasters instead of taking what they can from a sports show and hoping that\r\neverything translates well.\r\nBeyond the expected roles that shoutcasters fill, they also perform many secondary tasks\r\nwhich don't typically fall to traditional sportscasters. In the very early days of live-streaming, shoutcasters were often responsible for every aspect of the broadcast from set-up to teardown. Some shoutcasters still regularly assist on production aspects of the broadcast such as graphics\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n60\r\npackages, camera set-up, and audio checks, but others leave the production aspects of the stream\r\nto more experienced hands while focusing instead on updating websites, answering tweets, creating content, or streaming their own play sessionss. No two casters seem to fill exactly the same role within the broadcast team. They do, however, share some similarities which seem to form the shoutcaster identity.\r\nRecord-keepers and Community Managers\r\nAll of the casters pointed to stats-tracking as part of their roles outside of their air-time\r\nresponsibilities. Most of them keep highly detailed databases full of every possible stat they can\r\nget a hold of from game clients and public databases. These stats can be as simple as wins and\r\nlosses from remote regions or LAN tournaments that do not post their results online. The stats\r\ncan also get as minute as the number of units a particular Starcraft 2 player built in one particular\r\nmatch. When the data isn't readily available, shoutcasters go out of their way to curate the\r\ndatabase themselves. While some keep their database secret to provide a personal flair to their\r\ncasting, others find it important to share this information with their e-sports communities. One\r\nshoutcaster recalled his surprise when he first worked with a major South Korean e-sports\r\ncompany with its own dedicated stats team. He expressed that he had never realized how much\r\nhe needed a dedicated stats team like you find in traditional sports until that moment. It was then\r\nthat he realized how much of his daily routine stats curation filled. While he was grateful for the\r\nhelp, he also felt personally responsible for stats collection and did not entirely trust the figures\r\nfrom the professional statisticians. This example shows the difficult position e-sports fills,\r\nconstantly stuck between borrowing from traditional sports while not fully able to cope with the\r\nmaturity of the sports media industry.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n61\r\nAnother role which tends to fill a shoutcaster's daily routine is community maintenance.\r\nWhether the caster creates their own content on gaming sites, responds to fans on social media,\r\nor spends their time streaming and interacting with the community, they all mentioned some\r\nform of community maintenance as part of their duties as a shoutcaster. This particular focus on\r\ncommunity maintenance most likely results from the grassroots origins of shoutcasters. These\r\ncasters were a part of an e-sports community long before they became shoutcasters. Whether\r\nthey view it as their professional responsibility or a social responsibility remains unclear. They\r\nall admit to some level of e-sports advocacy, however. They view PR, and the proliferation of e-\r\nsports as part of their responsibilities. The most effective way to tackle this issue, many of them\r\nhave decided, is through community engagement. The community aspect of shoutcasting identity\r\nleads me to a discussion of the affordances of the hyper-connectivity in live-streaming.\r\nGrappling with the Hyper-Connectivity in Live-streaming and E-sports\r\nShoutcaster Connection\r\nI have yet to meet anyone in the e-sports industry who has not remarked on the unique\r\nlevel of connection present in e-sports. Shoutcasters especially, tap into the network created in\r\nthese online communities. In a representative summary of my conversations, one shoutcaster\r\nexplained, \"the connectedness is so unique in e-sports. The way that we can interact with fans\r\ninstantly. The players at the end of the day are gamers, they know exactly where to look.\r\nThey've got Twitter, they go on Facebook, they post on Reddit.\" Audience members connect\r\nephemerally in the IRC of a Twitch stream, but they constantly scour the social media outlets of\r\ntheir favorite stars, e-sports companies, and shoutcasters, creating a deeply connected\r\ncommunity. Professional shoutcasters understand that the e-sports communities operate in a\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n62\r\nunique way when compared to traditional sports fandom. E-sports fans have an odd connection\r\nto franchises or teams within their chosen e-sport. As mentioned before, turnover rates and\r\ngeneral industry growth force entire communities to radically reform from one season to another.\r\nWhere traditional sports fans often follow a team based on geographic loyalty, or\r\nfamilial connections, e-sports fans do not have that option. While you will often hear of fans\r\ncheering for teams in their geographic region (North America, Europe, South-East Asia, etc) if\r\nthey make it to the last few rounds of an international tournament, they may also base their\r\nfandom off of a team logo, or a particular player instead. Shoutcasters recognize this dynamic\r\nand use it to cultivate the community.\r\nCommunication, they claim, separates them from traditional sports broadcasts or even\r\nnews anchors: \"We communicate more with our audience than you'll see TV news anchors or\r\ncelebrities, but it's part of our job to get more information out there.\" The focus on\r\ncommunication seems to be unique to shoutcasters as the majority of it happens outside of their\r\nbroadcasts. While many shoutcasters define their role on-screen as an educator of sorts, the\r\nnotion of spreading information about e-sports falls outside of their screen time. This double role\r\nof broadcaster and community manager extends what media scholars have dubbed the\r\nbroadcasting persona beyond the point typically associated with sportscasters or news anchors.\r\nShoutcasters and Persona\r\nHorton and Wohl (1956), two social scientists who study mass media, make the assertion\r\nthat mass media performers make a conscious decision to create and maintain parasocial\r\ninteractions through the creation of a persona. Social scientists have coined the term parasocial\r\ninteraction for the intangible connection which most of us feel to some form of media or another.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 63\r\nStanding in contrast to interpersonal interaction, a person to person exchange between two real\r\nand cognizant human beings, parasocial interaction is instead a unidirectional relationship\r\n(Miller and Steinberg 1970). The feeling of connection we create with fictional characters, news\r\nanchors, or sports stars does not fall within the definition of an interpersonal interaction. Whether\r\nmediated through a screen or the pages of a book, a parasocial interaction does not manifest in an\r\nexchange of thoughts or words between individuals. Rather, it is embodied and lived through one\r\nindividual. Schiappa et al. (2007) conducted a meta-analysis of parasocial interaction literature to\r\nbetter understand how broadcasters 'hook' viewers to a certain show. They concluded that\r\nparasocial interactions can create and prolong connection to television programming. While\r\nSchiappa et al. concede that there are a few opportunities for a parasocial interaction to result in\r\ninterpersonal relationships in the physical world, the compelling issue is the establishment of\r\nintimacy mediated through means well outside of a person to person context.\r\nHorton and Wohl set out with the goal of creating a term for the relationship between\r\nperformers and their audience in mass media. The authors suggest that the emergence of mass\r\nmedia created an illusion of connection to performers which was previously unavailable. They\r\nargue that the connection people feel to mass media stars is analogous to primary social\r\nengagement. If this type of engagement takes place in radio and television, where users have no\r\nopportunity to interact with audience members who are not co-present, it follows that the\r\ninteraction between broadcasters, their audience, and one another in a Twitch stream is a\r\nparticularly deep connection even beyond the level noticed by Horton and Wohl.\r\nShoutcasters create a familiar face and personality for audience members to connect with.\r\nMark Levy (1979), another proponent of parasocial interaction who focused his work on news\r\nanchors, suggests that both news anchors and sportscasters help to create and maintain\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 64\r\ncommunities through regular scheduling, conversational tones, and the creation of a broadcasting\r\npersona. Shoutcasters perform this same role to even greater effect due to the constant changes\r\nsurrounding the e-sports industry. The regularity and consistency of shoutcasters' broadcasts\r\nhelps to foster a feeling of genuine connectedness within the community.\r\nAlthough difficult to quantify, many conversations with shoutcasters turned to the odd\r\nfeeling of connection that e-sports fans feel towards one another. One shoutcaster attempted to\r\nexplain this connection by stating, \"[w]henever I go to an event, I realize that fans are just\r\nfriends I haven't met yet.\" I found this statement to be particularly poignant. It hints to the sort of\r\nintangible connection e-sports industry personalities and fans feel to one another through live-\r\nstreams. Anecdotally, this air of friendship permeated e-sports events that I have attended and\r\nwent well beyond what I have felt at traditional sporting events or concerts.\r\nPreviously, persona creation and maintenance occurred on-screen or at events only.\r\nSocial media has forced many media personalities to extend their personas beyond the long-held\r\nnotions of broadcaster-fan interaction. In many ways, shoutcasters must go beyond even these\r\nextended boundaries into a near constant persona maintenance because of their roles in live-\r\nstreaming and community maintenance. Many shoutcasters give up their personal, off-air time to\r\nstream their own gameplay or to create video content which necessarily prolongs the amount of\r\ntime they embody their broadcast persona.\r\nI found that shoutcasters create a variation on the broadcast persona. Rather than a full-\r\nblown broadcasting personality which they inhabit while on-air, most shoutcasters have found\r\nthat between community management, social media interactions, and broadcasts, they almost\r\nnever get an opportunity to step out of their role as a shoutcaster. Due to this near constant\r\nconnection, most shoutcasters acknowledge that they act differently on air, but they tend to\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting 65\r\nsimply invoke a more upbeat and charismatic version of themselves. Echoed in each of the\r\ninterviews, the casters point to the idea of excitement, \"you have to get excited for the person out\r\nthere watching.\" Even if they are not in the mood to shoutcast, or they have had a bad day,\r\nshoutcasters must leave their personal issues out of the broadcast. This aspect of the\r\nshoutcaster's personality comes out in all of their interactions on social media as well.\r\nMost of the shoutcasters I interviewed situated their role in e-sports as somewhere\r\nbetween Public Relations, Marketing, and Community Management. One of the casters\r\nexplained the importance of invoking the broadcast persona when speaking about sponsor\r\nexpectations: \"We're working in an industry with companies behind us, we can't always say\r\nexactly what we want to say.\" Shoutcasters' acknowledgement of their involvement in securing\r\nsponsorships signals an interesting shift in the e-sports industry: the focus of the broadcast team\r\non potential revenue generation. I turn now to an analysis of the revenue streams found in both\r\ntraditional sports and e-sports broadcasting.\r\n    \r\n E-Sports Broadcasting\r\n66\r\nChapter 3\r\nRevenue\r\nFunding Professional Play\r\nAfter situating e-sports broadcasting within the greater sports media landscape,\r\nparticularly in conventions, casting, and use of medium, it is important to analyze the portions of\r\nsports media production that have made their way into e-sports broadcasting. If we acknowledge\r\nthe influence that traditional sports broadcasting has had on e-sports broadcasting in the realms\r\nof conventions and casting, we must also understand the importance of this relationship at the\r\nproduction and economic levels. In this chapter I discuss how the history and development of the\r\nsports media industrial complex in the U.S. has bled into the economics of the e-sports industry.\r\nIn particular, I focus on how sports media models inform the e-sports industry while portions of\r\nthe sports industry's revenue streams remain out of reach for e-sports broadcasters. Despite the\r\nreshuffling of the sports media industrial complex mentioned in the introduction to this thesis,\r\ntraditional sports broadcasting still relies on the same revenue streams that it had in the past.\r\nTraditional sports producers have fully capitalized on the commodification of their content. E-\r\nsports producers, in contrast, are still shaping their revenue streams within live-streaming. The\r\ncommercialization found in the sports media industrial complex has taken hold of the e-sports\r\nindustry in several notable ways. Following in the example set by Stein's thesis work, it is not\r\nenough to just acknowledge the relationship between e-sports and traditional sports media, we\r\nmust also understand the path which brought e-sports broadcasting to its current state.\n\nUsing ONLY the context block/prompt to guide your answer, provide a comprehensive comparison of the subjects mentioned in the question.

In the first 6 months, when the risk of sudden infant death\r\nsyndrome (SIDS) is at its highest, the safest place for a baby to sleep is on\r\ntheir back in their own sleep space, be that a cot, crib or moses basket.\r\nAdvertisement\r\nA bedside crib fastens to the frame of your bed on one side, so you're\r\neffectively lying next to your baby. The side can usually be dropped down\r\nso you can see and reach over to your child. They're sometimes referred\r\nto as side-sleepers or co-sleepers, but the key difference is that you're not\r\nsharing a sleep surface or bedding. You and your baby can maximise the\r\nsoothing benefits that proximity brings while minimising the risks\r\nassociated with bed sharing. Having your baby at arm's reach also makes\r\nnight feeds much easier.\r\nBest bedside cribs and co-sleepers at a glance\r\nJump to our list of the best bedside cribs and cosleepers\r\n\u2022\r\nBest bedside crib with an easy drop-down side: Chicco Next2Me\r\nMagic, \u00a3189\r\n\u2022\r\nBest bedside crib with a removable bassinet: SnuzPod 4 Bedside\r\nCrib, \u00a3199.95\r\n\u2022\r\nBest bedside crib for smooth rocking: Tutti Bambini CoZee Air\r\nBedside Crib, \u00a3225\r\n\u2022\r\nBest bedside crib for longevity: Shnuggle Air Bedside Crib, \u00a3180 \u2022\r\nThere are a wide range of options, so at MadeForMums we\u2019ve analysed\r\nthe bedside crib market closely to bring you the very best choices. We\u2019ve\r\nused feedback from our expert journalist reviewers and parent testers,\r\ncombined with results from in-house MadeForMums testing, which looked\r\nat key features such as breathability, mattress firmness, ease of building\r\nas well as functionality.\r\nFor each bedside crib we\u2019ve listed the key technical features to help you\r\ncompare across brands and models so you can find the best design to suit\r\nyour needs.\r\nIf your baby is struggling to sleep through the night, take a look at our best\r\nsleep aids and white noise machines, best nightlights and best baby\r\nswaddles.\r\nMore like this\r\nSilver Cross Voyager Co-Sleeper Bedside Crib\r\nreview\r\nWhat is the new safety standard for bedside cribs?\r\nAll new bedside cribs manufactured since November 2020 have to meet a\r\nnew safety standard (with the catchy name BS EN 1130:2019) that\r\nintroduced new and more rigorous safety requirements for bedside cribs.\r\nHowever, you may find some older versions of cribs are still on sale that\r\nonly match the previous safety standard. Slowly these will disappear from\r\nstores and the only ones available will meet the new standard.\r\nThe most significant new requirement for BS EN 1130:2019 is for a 120mm\r\nBest bedside crib for extra storage: Maxi-Cosie Iora Bedside\r\nSleeper, \u00a3149\r\n\u2022\r\nBest bedside crib for one-handed operation: Joie Roomie GO, \u00a3180 \u2022\r\nBest value bedside crib: Red Kite Cozysleep Bedside Crib, \u00a384.99 \u2022\r\nBest bedside crib with 360\u00b0 swivel: Halo BassiNest Premiere Swivel\r\nSleeper, \u00a3248.29\r\n\u2022\r\nhigh barrier to be present around the sides of the crib, to ensure your\r\nbaby is not able to roll off their own mattress onto yours. This means that\r\nnew bedside cribs can no longer have complete drop-down sides \u2013 many\r\nnow have 'half-height' walls instead.\r\nThis allows your baby to be positioned next to you with the crib lined up to\r\nyour bed, but their mattress will be sunk a little lower, providing more of a\r\nprotective barrier. All the cribs featured in our list comply with these new\r\nBS EN 1130:2019 safety requirements.\r\nWhat to look for when buying a bedside crib\r\nWill it work with your bed? \u2013 Certain bed frames can be trickier to use\r\nwith a bedside crib. For example, if you have a divan bed you will need\r\nlonger straps, and may not be able to tuck the legs of the crib underneath\r\nthe bed and may need to look for a model that has foldable legs or works\r\nwith your bed style.\r\nHeight of your bed \u2013 Most bedside cribs have adjustable heights to give\r\nyou an almost perfect fit on most bed frames, but if your bed is\r\nparticularly low or high, do check the measurements. Also check the size\r\nof the crib and whether it will fit next to your bed while allowing you to get\r\nin and out easily and safely. This is particularly important for those first\r\nfew days and weeks after giving birth when your body is still recovering.\r\nMattress \u2013 The mattress needs to be firm, flat and breathable \u2013 this is a\r\nkey safety feature. Don\u2019t be tempted by a super soft mattress \u2013 your baby\r\nwill sleep deeply and most importantly safely on a firm mattress.\r\nDrop-down side \u2013 How easy is it to remove the side? Can you do it with\r\none hand? As you may be doing this in the middle of the night, are there\r\nlots of noisy zips and clips? Can it safely be left down while you sleep? Do\r\ncheck this as the rules differ depending on the product.\r\nHow easy is it to assemble \u2013 Are there lots of parts to screw together? Will\r\nyou need 2 people to build it? We\u2019ve tested how easy different bedside\r\ncribs are to build in our reviews.\r\nHow easy is it to keep clean \u2013 Does the mattress have a waterproof cover\r\nto protect from leaky nappies, baby sick and dribbles? Is the fabric\r\nmachine washable or will you have to hand wash it?\r\nPortability \u2013 Is the crib light enough to move around your house? If you\r\nwant to take it away with you does it crib fold flat and/or come with a\r\nstorage bag?\r\nExtra features \u2013 Does it rock (useful for fussy sleepers), tilt (remember to\r\nuse tilting with care), detach to become a moses basket or turn into an\r\nolder baby cot or playpen? These extra features may not be necessary, but\r\nthey could be useful.\r\nFor more safety information we've also covered breathability, bedding and\r\nhow to use the tilting function here.\r\nWhat are the benefits of using a bedside crib?\r\nSafe sleep charity The Lullaby Trust, advises that the safest place for your\r\nbaby to sleep is on their own sleep surface, in the same room as you, for\r\nat least the first 6 months. Bedside cribs allow you to have your baby\r\nsleeping right next to you at night, but in the safety of their own crib. This\r\nmeans you can still be close to your baby without bed-sharing, which\r\ncarries a risk of suffocation and overheating.\r\nBedside cribs enable you to lean over and easily pick up your baby when\r\nfeeding at night. This is especially useful if you\u2019ve had a difficult birth or a\r\nc-section and find getting out of bed painful. You can also easily comfort\r\nyour baby if they are fussing and have a good view of them while they are\r\nsleeping.\r\nHow to do the baby mattress firmness test\r\nPress your hand on the centre and the sides of the mattress \u2022\r\nA firm mattress shouldn\u2019t mould to the shape of your hand and\r\nyou\u2019ll feel resistance \u2013 it will obviously move beneath the\r\npressure but your hand shouldn\u2019t sink in\r\n\u2022\r\nWhen you remove your hand, the mattress should snap back\r\nand regain its shape\r\n\u2022\r\nFrom a practical perspective, bedside cribs are smaller and more compact\r\nthan most cots, which means they take up less space in your bedroom\r\nthan a full-sized cot or cotbed.\r\nDo I need a bedside crib for my baby?\r\nYou don\u2019t have to buy a bedside crib. It's completely safe to put a baby in a\r\nregular cot from birth. But they\u2019re a great option if you want your baby as\r\nclose to you as possible at night, and for saving space. The downside is\r\nthat most of these cribs only last up to 6 months and you\u2019ll then need to\r\nmove your baby into a full-sized cot or cotbed. A moses basket is a more\r\neconomical option, but these can last even less time, and do not have the\r\nadded features of a bedside crib such as a drop-down side, tilt, or multiple\r\nheights.\r\nHow much does a bedside crib cost?\r\nIt is possible to buy budget bedside cribs for under \u00a3100 but the majority\r\nwe have reviewed are between \u00a3150-\u00a3300. Certain features, such as a\r\nrocking function or one-handed drop down side, tend to push the price up\r\nslightly.\r\nHow did we choose these bedside cribs?\r\nOur 10 of the Best lists are compiled by qualified and experienced\r\nparenting journalists. They rely on a number of sources, including our\r\nindependent reviews, testing undertaken during the MadeForMums\r\nAwards, and feedback from our home testing panel and Top Testers\r\nClub. Each year thousands of products are put through their paces by\r\nhundreds of parents across the country on behalf of MadeForMums,\r\nto ensure we\u2019re bringing you honest and true reviews and\r\nrecommendations.\r\nWhen testing bedside cribs, we consider size, ease of build and fitting,\r\nmattress quality and breathability, ease and safety of the drop-down\r\nside mechanism and other features, comfort for baby, design and\r\nquality, and whether it's worth the money.\r\nOur list is not an ordered ranking from 1-10, instead it is a carefully\r\nHere are our top 10 bedside cribs for 2024\r\n1. Chicco Next2Me Magic, \u00a3189\r\n\u2013 Best for easy drop-down side\r\nSuitable from: Birth to 6 months/9kg | Weight: 13.1kg | Crib size: H66.5-\r\n82.4cm x W73cm x L99.5cm | Mattress size: L83cm x W50.5cm | Tilt: Yes\r\n| Rocks: Yes | Height positions: 11 | Washable mattress cover: Hand\r\nwash\r\nThe Chicco Next2Me Magic is the latest update to the original Next2Me\r\nside-sleeping crib, which has won fans for its versatility. It can be used\r\nfrom birth as a bedside co-sleeper, as a standalone crib or possibly as a\r\ntravel cot, but at over 13kg it's not a light carry.\r\nIt is slightly more expensive than some other models, but standout\r\nfeatures include a really easy drop-side that can be operated with one\r\nhand, 11 height levels, a lockable rocking function, 4 tilt options to help\r\nreduce reflux, and wheels to make it easy to move around your home.\r\nselected group of tried-and-tested products, each of which we believe\r\nis best for a different situation or requirement. We don\u2019t just tell you\r\nwhat is best, we help you discover what is best for your family.\r\nA large sleeping area means more room for a bigger baby, plus a travel\r\nbag is included.\r\nMFM tester Lucy said, \u201cI found the Chicco Next2Me Magic a breeze to\r\nmove around and set up, but also substantial and sturdy. The clever onehanded drop-down mechanism on the side panel can be used while\r\nholding your baby in your arms, which is brilliant.\r\n\"I've even used the Chicco in my kitchen for safe day naps when I need to\r\nbe more focused on my older child.\u201d\r\nPros: Firm and breathable mattress, retractable legs to fit any bed, quiet\r\nside zip, easy to transport\r\nCons: Tricky to initially assemble, mattress cover is hand wash only\r\nRead our full MadeForMums Chicco Next2Me Magic bedside crib review\r\nAvailable from: John Lewis and Mamas & Papas\r\nJohn Lewis & Partners \u00a3229.00 Buy now\r\nMamas & Papas \u00a3229.00 Buy now\r\n2. SnuzPod 4 Bedside Crib, \u00a3199.95\r\n\u2013 Best for removable bassinet\r\nSuitable from: Birth to 6 months/9kg | Weight: 11.5kg | Crib size: H95cm\r\nx W49cm x L100cm | Mattress size: L75cm x W40cm | Tilt: Yes | Rocks:\r\nYes | Height positions: 7 | Washable mattress cover: Machine washable\r\nThe latest iteration of Snuz's much-loved bedside crib, the Snuzpod4\r\nfeatures a new breathable system (called ComfortAir) that aids the flow of\r\nair around the crib and your baby. It offers more side vents, breathable\r\nmesh liner and mattress, plus a ventilated base.\r\nBut the key thing that we're delighted to see is that the Snuzpod4 has a\r\nfirmer mattress than previous versions \u2013 as well as good breathability.\r\nPlus Snuz claims that the SnuzPod4 fits more bed heights than any rival, as\r\nit will now work with beds up to a maximum adult mattress height of\r\n73cm. It's also designed to be compatible with a range of bed types \u2013\r\ndivan, ottoman and framed bed bases.\r\nMade from sustainably sourced beech solid wood, the Snuzpod4 looks\r\ngood. MFM mum home tester Mehack commented on \"how stylish and\r\ncontemporary the design is,\" praising how it \"fits perfectly with the room\r\ndecor\".\r\nWe love its versatility \u2013 the two-part design includes a lift-off bassinet that\r\ncan be moved around the house so you have a portable safe sleeping\r\nspace for your baby, whichever room you're in. The bassinet also has a\r\nmanual rocking function, as does the crib and the bassinet. There's an\r\noptional riser that can be added to create a slight incline to help babies\r\nwith reflux, but for safety reasons, when the cot is tilted this stops the\r\nrocking function from working.\r\nPros: Stylish, removable bassinet, great storage\r\nCons: Can be difficult to put together\r\nRead our full MadeForMums SnuzPod 4 bedside crib review\r\nAvailable from: Snuz, Samuel Johnston and Amazon\r\nVery.co.uk \u00a3159.99 Buy now\r\nSamuel Johnston \u00a3190.18 Buy now\r\nAmazon UK \u00a3199.95 Buy now\r\nJohn Lewis & Partners \u00a3199.95 Buy now\r\n3. Tutti Bambini CoZee Air Bedside Crib, \u00a3225\r\n\u2013 Best for smooth rocking\r\nSuitable from: Birth to 6 months/9kg | Weight: 11kg | Crib size: H92cm x\r\nW12cm x L56cm | Mattress size: L80.5cm x W51cm | Tilt: Yes | Rocks: Yes\r\n| Height positions: 6 | Washable mattress cover: Sponge, only machine\r\nwash if necessary\r\nWhile it is at the more expensive end of the market, what makes the\r\nCoZee Air stand out from the competition is its smooth rocking function. It\r\ncomes with easy-to-remove caster wheels that you can switch with rocking\r\nbars, which easily attach to the legs of the crib. As a safety feature, the\r\nCoZee can also only be rocked when it is set up as a standalone crib \u2013\r\nwhen used as a bedside crib, it has flip-out feet that prevent it from doing\r\nso. \u201cThe rocking feature is fantastic and really helped me to settle my baby\r\nwhen she was overtired and fussing,\u201d said MFM tester Tara.\r\nMFM testers also rated the crib highly for its portability \u2013 it is ideal as a\r\ntravel cot, as despite its large size, it is compact when folded. A 30-second\r\nopen-fold mechanism allows for a quick set up and it comes with a travel\r\nbag for easy transportation.\r\nWhile the multiple mesh windows are great for breathability and being\r\nable to see your little one, there's a curtain attached to one side of the crib\r\nthat you can roll down to protect your baby from draughts during colder\r\nmonths. This still leaves one mesh side open to allow for plenty of air flow.\r\nWhen it comes to cleaning, the fabric lining can be removed and put in the\r\nwashing machine, while the foam mattress can be machine washed if\r\nnecessary. We also like the addition of a storage shelf that is useful for\r\nholding essentials such as baby wipes, nappies, clothes and muslins.\r\nPros: Smooth rocking, quick to collapse down, storage shelf\r\nCons: Higher price point\r\nRead our full MadeForMums Tutti Bambini CoZee Air Bedside Crib review\r\nAvailable from: Boots, Kiddies Kingdom and Tutti Bambini\r\nKiddies Kingdom \u00a3165.00 Buy now\r\nFor Your Little One \u00a3180.00 Buy now\r\nWayfair \u00a3186.63 Buy now\r\nDunelm \u00a3219.00 Buy now\r\n4. Shnuggle Air Bedside crib, \u00a3180\r\n\u2013 Best for longevity\r\nSuitable from: Birth to 6 months/9kg (up to 2 years with conversion kit) |\r\nWeight: 13.4kg | Crib size: H68.5\u201383cm x W56cm x L94cm | Mattress size:\r\nL83cm x W50cm | Tilt: Yes | Rocks: No | Height positions: 7 | Washable\r\nmattress cover: Hand wash\r\nWhile most bedside cribs on the market are only suitable for babies up to\r\n6 months old, the Shnuggle Air stands out by offering 3 products in 1. It\r\ncan be used as a standalone cot or bedside sleeper and then it transforms\r\nafter 6 months into a full-sized cot when you buy the additional\r\nconversion kit (\u00a3109.95) and cot mattress (\u00a350), which will last your child\r\nup until around 2 years old. This makes it a great long-term investment.\r\nMFM judges and testers were particularly impressed with the firmness of\r\nits hypo-allergenic airflow mattress. This crib has dual-view mesh sides,\r\ngiving it maximum breathability; this also means you can easily see your\r\nbaby when both sides are up. This was also a feature that stood out to\r\nMFM reviewer Tara, who used it with her 6-month-old daughter Elodie.\r\nShe said, \u201cElodie slept very soundly and she loved being able to see\r\nthrough the mesh sides.\u201d\r\nThe drop-down sides are easily removed for nighttime access by releasing\r\nthe safety catch on the top bar and undoing the zips. However, during the\r\nawards testing, it was noted that the safety catch makes a loud click. This\r\nwas echoed by a MFM user reviewer who said: \u201cThe side makes a noise\r\nwhen you click it back in and that can wake up baby!\u201d Unlike most of the\r\nothers on this list, the side of the Shnuggle Air cannot be left down during\r\nsleep, it's simply there for access.\r\nThe Shnuggle Air is relatively heavy at 13.4kg, and doesn't have wheels, so\r\nit's not easy to move around your home. \u201cI\u2019d say once the Shnuggle Air is\r\nset up, it\u2019s staying put,\u201d Tara added.\r\nPros: Long-lasting, highly breathable, spacious\r\nCons: Not easily portable, side is noisy when released, hand wash only\r\nRead our full MadeForMums Shnuggle Air Bedside Crib review\r\nAvailable from: Amazon, John Lewis and Shnuggle\r\nJohn Lewis & Partners \u00a3180.00 Buy now\r\nAmazon UK \u00a3199.95 Buy now\r\nKiddies Kingdom \u00a3299.00 Buy now\r\n5. Maxi-Cosi Iora bedside sleeper, \u00a3149\r\n\u2013 Best for extra storage\r\nSuitable from: Birth to 6 months/9kg | Weight: 10.8kg | Crib size:\r\nH74.5cm x W55.5cm x L93cm | Mattress size: L80cm x W58.5cm | Tilt: Yes\r\n| Rocks: No | Height positions: 5 | Washable mattress cover: Hand wash\r\nWith its choice of muted colours, sleek design and quality materials, the\r\nMaxi-Cosi Iora is sure to fit in with most room schemes. The large storage\r\nbasket at the bottom of the crib is great for parents who are short on\r\nspace as it can easily hold numerous blankets, baby sleeping bags,\r\nnappies, wipes and spare clothes.\r\nThe Iora\u2019s easy-to-adjust height (5 positions in total) and slide function (2\r\npositions in total) also means it can fit snugly against most types of bed\r\nwhen used with the straps. \u201cOur iron-frame bed is somewhat lower than\r\naverage,\u201d said MFM reviewer Georgina. \u201cBut the Iora also sat in the correct\r\nposition with our mattress.\u201d\r\nOne feature that our reviewer Georgina particularly liked was that when\r\nthe side is down, there is a 7-inch (18cm) barrier to stop your baby rolling\r\nout. She said: \u201cThe Iora allowed me to sleep as close to my daughter as\r\npossible, but I was also safe in the knowledge that she was in her own\r\nsleeping area and I wasn't going to squash her!\u201d\r\nThis crib is extremely straightforward to assemble (one of the quickest\r\nduring MFM testing) and MFM reviewer Georgina managed to put it\r\ntogether speedily without using the instructions. She explained: \u201cIt was\r\nobvious which pieces go together, simple to build and had neat zips to\r\nkeep everything in place.\u201d A handy bag also means it can easily be used as\r\na travel cot, especially as it folds down flat. Keep in mind that Georgina did\r\nfind the outer fabric was prone to creasing when unpacked from the travel\r\nbag.\r\nPros: Extra storage, easy height and slide adjustments, portable, smart\r\nappearance\r\nCons: Mattress cover hand wash only, outer fabric prone to creasing, not\r\nas many height options as other cribs, only mesh on one side\r\nRead our full MadeForMums Maxi-Cosi Iora review\r\nAvailable from: Samuel Johnston, John Lewis and Amazon\r\nKiddies Kingdom \u00a3169.00 Buy now\r\nJohn Lewis & Partners \u00a3199.99 Buy now\r\nMamas & Papas \u00a3199.99 Buy now\r\nVery.co.uk \u00a3199.99 Buy now\r\n6. Joie Roomie GO, \u00a3180\r\n\u2013 Best for one-handed operation\r\nSuitable from: Birth to 6 months/9kg | Weight: 9.5kg | Crib size: H74.8-\r\n82.2cm x W68.5cm x L90.3cm | Mattress size: H6cm x W51cm x L84cm |\r\nTilt: Yes | Rocks: No | Height positions: 5 | Washable mattress cover:\r\nMachine washable | Awards: Gold \u2013 Bedside/Co-Sleeper Crib,\r\nMadeForMum Awards 2023\r\nAwarded Gold in Best Bedside/Co-Sleeper Crib, MadeForMums Awards\r\n2023, the Joie Roomie Go packs in a lot of features for its mid-range price.\r\nOffering mesh windows on both sides, providing plenty of ventilation as\r\nwell as making it easy to keep an eye on your baby, the stylish crib is\r\navailable in a choice of chic grey or classic black. Our MFM home testers\r\nwere impressed with the Roomie Go\u2019s aesthetic, with one commenting, \u201cIt\r\nlooks great, is made with good quality material and will look stylish in any\r\nroom.\u201d\r\nThe one-handed drop-down panels on both sides of the crib mean you\r\ncan easily switch which side of the bed you attach it to. You should be able\r\nto simply click the handle to lift and lower, although one of our home\r\ntesters commented that the first couple of times they attempted this the\r\nmechanism was a little sticky.\r\nIts simple, compact fold means you can pack the crib away in less than a\r\nminute and take it with you in the travel bag included, for holidays or trips\r\nto the grandparents\u2019.\r\nThe Joie Roomie Go is also on (lockable) wheels so you can move it around\r\nthe home during the daytime. It has a tummy tilt for reflux/colic, and there\r\nare 5 height adjustments to fit most beds. Praised across the board by our\r\nMFM home testers for its comfy mattress and ease of assembly, it\u2019s a great\r\nall-rounder both when at home and away.\r\nPros: One-handed operation, tilt function for reflux, comfortable for baby,\r\ndrop-down panels on both sides, travel bag included\r\nCons: No storage, not as many height options as other cribs\r\nAvailable from: John Lewis, Joie and Argos\r\nVery.co.uk \u00a3179.99 Buy now\r\nargos.co.uk \u00a3180.00 Buy now\r\nJohn Lewis & Partners \u00a3180.00 Buy now\r\nKiddies Kingdom \u00a3180.00 Buy now\r\n7.

However, the great price doesn't mean there's a\r\ncompromise on features or style. \u201cIt\u2019s a well-made product that looks\r\nmodern and would easily suit all bedrooms,\u201d said MFM home tester Kiran,\r\nwho appreciated the simple, yet contemporary look.\r\nThe crib has a drop-down side, 7 adjustable height positions, a tilt function\r\n(great for helping with reflux) and a handy storage shelf for things like\r\nnappies and wipes. It's on wheels, so it can be moved around the room or\r\naway from the bed with ease, and it also folds down to a more compact\r\nsize for travel. There\u2019s even a handy storage bag included, which our\r\ntesters felt helps you to get even more use out of the Cozysleep as a travel\r\ncot.\r\nOne feature that really impressed our home testers was the quality of the\r\nsoft, quilted mattress, with one MFM home tester commenting, \u201cThe\r\nmattress is brilliant! I have used other makes of co-sleepers/cribs and this\r\nmattress is triple the thickness. It feels soft but firm and very comfy.\u201d\r\nPros: Great value, tilt function, good quality mattress, handy storage shelf,\r\ntravel bag included\r\nCons: Only mesh on one side\r\nAvailable from: Amazon and Kiddies Kingdom\r\nKiddies Kingdom \u00a379.99 Buy now\r\nSamuel Johnston \u00a3104.40 Buy now\r\n8.

Offering a slightly different way to sleep closely\r\nbut safely with your baby, the BassiNest Premiere is a standalone crib with\r\na central stand that slides beneath the bed, rather than fastening on to\r\nthe side of the bed.\r\nParents can then swivel the crib 360\u00b0 for easy access, with one MFM home\r\ntester pointing out this also \"makes it easy to get in and out of bed without\r\ndisturbing the baby\". There's no drop-down side, instead the mesh side\r\nhas enough give that you can push it down to reach and get your baby\r\nbefore it automatically returns to the upright position.\r\nCompared to cribs with open sides that sit flush with the bed, the\r\nBassiNest is more of a hybrid product, sitting somewhere between a\r\nmoses basket and a bedside crib. While the BassiNest Premiere doesn't\r\nhave a rock or tilt function, it does have a built-in \u201csoothing centre\u201d that\r\nfeatures an amber nightlight, floorlight, 2 vibration levels and 4 soothing\r\nsounds, all with auto shutoff. To use this function you will need 3 x AA\r\nbatteries (not included).\r\nPros: Flexible, useful when recovering from birth, customisable height to\r\nfit most beds, built-in soothing centre\r\nCons: Not a true bedside crib, very heavy, need batteries to access the\r\nsoothing centre functions, expensive\r\nAvailable from: Halo, John Lewis and Boots\r\nJohn Lewis & Partners \u00a3249.00 Buy now\r\nHow do you use a bedside crib safely?\r\nThe most important piece of advice for safe sleeping is to lie your baby on\r\ntheir back to sleep. Indeed, since the Back To Sleep campaign was\r\nlaunched in the UK 30 years ago, cases of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death\r\nSyndrome) have fallen by 80%.\r\nWhen using a bedside crib, you should ensure there is no gap between the\r\nadult's and baby's mattress. Your baby\u2019s mattress should be firm and flat,\r\nand sit snugly in the crib with no gaps.\r\nAlso look for a mattress that is breathable. There's a simple test you can\r\ndo for this:\r\nMost cribs come with a mattress as standard, but if you are given the crib\r\nby someone else or buy one second-hand you will need to buy a new\r\nmattress \u2013 even if the existing one appears to be in good condition.\r\nSecond-hand mattresses may increase the risk of SIDS and are less likely\r\nto be supportive after losing their shape over time. Always use the\r\nmattress designed to fit your bedside crib \u2013 most retailers sell them\r\nseparately should you need a replacement.\r\nWhen it comes to a safe sleeping position, place your baby in the crib with\r\ntheir feet at the end of the crib \u2013 called the feet-to-foot position. This\r\nreduces the risk of their face or head slipping down under the covers if\r\nyou're using a blanket.\r\nHow to use tilting and rocking features safely\r\nSome bedside cribs offer a tilt option, which may help babies with\r\ndigestive issues, colic or reflux. If you are going to tilt your baby, you must\r\ndo so with great care and only at a slight angle, to avoid your baby slipping\r\ndown. We recommend speaking to your GP or health visitor for advice\r\nbefore using the tilt function.\r\nTilting (and rocking) can only be used when the bedside crib is set up as a\r\nOur at-home mattress breathability test\r\nPick up the mattress and place it close to your mouth \u2022\r\nBreathe in and see how easy it is to breathe out with the\r\nmattress near your mouth\r\n\u2022\r\nIf it\u2019s easier this should mean the mattress offers good\r\nventilation\r\n\u2022\r\nstandalone crib \u2013 for safety reasons, you should not tilt or rock the crib\r\nwhen the side is down as there is a chance your baby could fall out.\r\nWhat bedding can I use with a bedside crib?\r\nThe Lullaby Trust advises, \u201cFirmly tucked-in sheets and blankets (not above\r\nshoulder height) or a baby sleep bag are safe for a baby to sleep in.\u201d Make\r\nsure you buy the correct size sheets that exactly fit your mattress. You\r\nmay also choose to swaddle a newborn. The Lullaby Trust does not advise\r\nfor or against swaddling, but it does have some basic swaddling guidance.\r\nYou must stop using a swaddle as soon as your baby learns to roll.\r\nNot all baby sleeping bags and swaddles are created equal, so make sure\r\nthe brand you buy adheres to safety standards, is the correct tog for the\r\nroom temperature and season, and is the right size for your baby, so they\r\ncan't slip down inside.\r\nDon\u2019t use any soft or bulky bedding and never use pillows, duvets, baby\r\nbumpers or baby positioners. You should also remove any soft toys from\r\nthe crib before your baby sleeps.\r\nAdvertisement\r\nRead more...\r\nGemma Cartwright\r\nGroup Digital Editor\r\nGemma has two decades of experience in digital content.

In the first 6 months, when the risk of sudden infant death\r\nsyndrome (SIDS) is at its highest, the safest place for a baby to sleep is on\r\ntheir back in their own sleep space, be that a cot, crib or moses basket.\r\nAdvertisement\r\nA bedside crib fastens to the frame of your bed on one side, so you're\r\neffectively lying next to your baby. The side can usually be dropped down\r\nso you can see and reach over to your child. They're sometimes referred\r\nto as side-sleepers or co-sleepers, but the key difference is that you're not\r\nsharing a sleep surface or bedding. You and your baby can maximise the\r\nsoothing benefits that proximity brings while minimising the risks\r\nassociated with bed sharing. Having your baby at arm's reach also makes\r\nnight feeds much easier.\r\nBest bedside cribs and co-sleepers at a glance\r\nJump to our list of the best bedside cribs and cosleepers\r\n\u2022\r\nBest bedside crib with an easy drop-down side: Chicco Next2Me\r\nMagic, \u00a3189\r\n\u2022\r\nBest bedside crib with a removable bassinet: SnuzPod 4 Bedside\r\nCrib, \u00a3199.95\r\n\u2022\r\nBest bedside crib for smooth rocking: Tutti Bambini CoZee Air\r\nBedside Crib, \u00a3225\r\n\u2022\r\nBest bedside crib for longevity: Shnuggle Air Bedside Crib, \u00a3180 \u2022\r\nThere are a wide range of options, so at MadeForMums we\u2019ve analysed\r\nthe bedside crib market closely to bring you the very best choices.

Slowly these will disappear from\r\nstores and the only ones available will meet the new standard.\r\nThe most significant new requirement for BS EN 1130:2019 is for a 120mm\r\nBest bedside crib for extra storage: Maxi-Cosie Iora Bedside\r\nSleeper, \u00a3149\r\n\u2022\r\nBest bedside crib for one-handed operation: Joie Roomie GO, \u00a3180 \u2022\r\nBest value bedside crib: Red Kite Cozysleep Bedside Crib, \u00a384.99 \u2022\r\nBest bedside crib with 360\u00b0 swivel: Halo BassiNest Premiere Swivel\r\nSleeper, \u00a3248.29\r\n\u2022\r\nhigh barrier to be present around the sides of the crib, to ensure your\r\nbaby is not able to roll off their own mattress onto yours. This means that\r\nnew bedside cribs can no longer have complete drop-down sides \u2013 many\r\nnow have 'half-height' walls instead.\r\nThis allows your baby to be positioned next to you with the crib lined up to\r\nyour bed, but their mattress will be sunk a little lower, providing more of a\r\nprotective barrier. All the cribs featured in our list comply with these new\r\nBS EN 1130:2019 safety requirements.\r\nWhat to look for when buying a bedside crib\r\nWill it work with your bed? \u2013 Certain bed frames can be trickier to use\r\nwith a bedside crib. For example, if you have a divan bed you will need\r\nlonger straps, and may not be able to tuck the legs of the crib underneath\r\nthe bed and may need to look for a model that has foldable legs or works\r\nwith your bed style.\r\nHeight of your bed \u2013 Most bedside cribs have adjustable heights to give\r\nyou an almost perfect fit on most bed frames, but if your bed is\r\nparticularly low or high, do check the measurements. Also check the size\r\nof the crib and whether it will fit next to your bed while allowing you to get\r\nin and out easily and safely. This is particularly important for those first\r\nfew days and weeks after giving birth when your body is still recovering.\r\nMattress \u2013 The mattress needs to be firm, flat and breathable \u2013 this is a\r\nkey safety feature. Don\u2019t be tempted by a super soft mattress \u2013 your baby\r\nwill sleep deeply and most importantly safely on a firm mattress.\r\nDrop-down side \u2013 How easy is it to remove the side? Can you do it with\r\none hand? As you may be doing this in the middle of the night, are there\r\nlots of noisy zips and clips? Can it safely be left down while you sleep? Do\r\ncheck this as the rules differ depending on the product.\r\nHow easy is it to assemble \u2013 Are there lots of parts to screw together? Will\r\nyou need 2 people to build it? We\u2019ve tested how easy different bedside\r\ncribs are to build in our reviews.\r\nHow easy is it to keep clean \u2013 Does the mattress have a waterproof cover\r\nto protect from leaky nappies, baby sick and dribbles? Is the fabric\r\nmachine washable or will you have to hand wash it?\r\nPortability \u2013 Is the crib light enough to move around your house? If you\r\nwant to take it away with you does it crib fold flat and/or come with a\r\nstorage bag?\r\nExtra features \u2013 Does it rock (useful for fussy sleepers), tilt (remember to\r\nuse tilting with care), detach to become a moses basket or turn into an\r\nolder baby cot or playpen? These extra features may not be necessary, but\r\nthey could be useful.\r\nFor more safety information we've also covered breathability, bedding and\r\nhow to use the tilting function here.\r\nWhat are the benefits of using a bedside crib?\r\nSafe sleep charity The Lullaby Trust, advises that the safest place for your\r\nbaby to sleep is on their own sleep surface, in the same room as you, for\r\nat least the first 6 months. Bedside cribs allow you to have your baby\r\nsleeping right next to you at night, but in the safety of their own crib. This\r\nmeans you can still be close to your baby without bed-sharing, which\r\ncarries a risk of suffocation and overheating.\r\nBedside cribs enable you to lean over and easily pick up your baby when\r\nfeeding at night. This is especially useful if you\u2019ve had a difficult birth or a\r\nc-section and find getting out of bed painful. You can also easily comfort\r\nyour baby if they are fussing and have a good view of them while they are\r\nsleeping.\r\nHow to do the baby mattress firmness test\r\nPress your hand on the centre and the sides of the mattress \u2022\r\nA firm mattress shouldn\u2019t mould to the shape of your hand and\r\nyou\u2019ll feel resistance \u2013 it will obviously move beneath the\r\npressure but your hand shouldn\u2019t sink in\r\n\u2022\r\nWhen you remove your hand, the mattress should snap back\r\nand regain its shape\r\n\u2022\r\nFrom a practical perspective, bedside cribs are smaller and more compact\r\nthan most cots, which means they take up less space in your bedroom\r\nthan a full-sized cot or cotbed.\r\nDo I need a bedside crib for my baby?\r\nYou don\u2019t have to buy a bedside crib. It's completely safe to put a baby in a\r\nregular cot from birth. But they\u2019re a great option if you want your baby as\r\nclose to you as possible at night, and for saving space. The downside is\r\nthat most of these cribs only last up to 6 months and you\u2019ll then need to\r\nmove your baby into a full-sized cot or cotbed. A moses basket is a more\r\neconomical option, but these can last even less time, and do not have the\r\nadded features of a bedside crib such as a drop-down side, tilt, or multiple\r\nheights.\r\nHow much does a bedside crib cost?\r\nIt is possible to buy budget bedside cribs for under \u00a3100 but the majority\r\nwe have reviewed are between \u00a3150-\u00a3300. Certain features, such as a\r\nrocking function or one-handed drop down side, tend to push the price up\r\nslightly.\r\nHow did we choose these bedside cribs?\r\nOur 10 of the Best lists are compiled by qualified and experienced\r\nparenting journalists. They rely on a number of sources, including our\r\nindependent reviews, testing undertaken during the MadeForMums\r\nAwards, and feedback from our home testing panel and Top Testers\r\nClub. Each year thousands of products are put through their paces by\r\nhundreds of parents across the country on behalf of MadeForMums,\r\nto ensure we\u2019re bringing you honest and true reviews and\r\nrecommendations.\r\nWhen testing bedside cribs, we consider size, ease of build and fitting,\r\nmattress quality and breathability, ease and safety of the drop-down\r\nside mechanism and other features, comfort for baby, design and\r\nquality, and whether it's worth the money.\r\nOur list is not an ordered ranking from 1-10, instead it is a carefully\r\nHere are our top 10 bedside cribs for 2024\r\n1. Chicco Next2Me Magic, \u00a3189\r\n\u2013 Best for easy drop-down side\r\nSuitable from: Birth to 6 months/9kg | Weight: 13.1kg | Crib size: H66.5-\r\n82.4cm x W73cm x L99.5cm | Mattress size: L83cm x W50.5cm | Tilt: Yes\r\n| Rocks: Yes | Height positions: 11 | Washable mattress cover: Hand\r\nwash\r\nThe Chicco Next2Me Magic is the latest update to the original Next2Me\r\nside-sleeping crib, which has won fans for its versatility. It can be used\r\nfrom birth as a bedside co-sleeper, as a standalone crib or possibly as a\r\ntravel cot, but at over 13kg it's not a light carry.\r\nIt is slightly more expensive than some other models, but standout\r\nfeatures include a really easy drop-side that can be operated with one\r\nhand, 11 height levels, a lockable rocking function, 4 tilt options to help\r\nreduce reflux, and wheels to make it easy to move around your home.\r\nselected group of tried-and-tested products, each of which we believe\r\nis best for a different situation or requirement. We don\u2019t just tell you\r\nwhat is best, we help you discover what is best for your family.\r\nA large sleeping area means more room for a bigger baby, plus a travel\r\nbag is included.\r\nMFM tester Lucy said, \u201cI found the Chicco Next2Me Magic a breeze to\r\nmove around and set up, but also substantial and sturdy. The clever onehanded drop-down mechanism on the side panel can be used while\r\nholding your baby in your arms, which is brilliant.\r\n\"I've even used the Chicco in my kitchen for safe day naps when I need to\r\nbe more focused on my older child.\u201d\r\nPros: Firm and breathable mattress, retractable legs to fit any bed, quiet\r\nside zip, easy to transport\r\nCons: Tricky to initially assemble, mattress cover is hand wash only\r\nRead our full MadeForMums Chicco Next2Me Magic bedside crib review\r\nAvailable from: John Lewis and Mamas & Papas\r\nJohn Lewis & Partners \u00a3229.00 Buy now\r\nMamas & Papas \u00a3229.00 Buy now\r\n2. SnuzPod 4 Bedside Crib, \u00a3199.95\r\n\u2013 Best for removable bassinet\r\nSuitable from: Birth to 6 months/9kg | Weight: 11.5kg | Crib size: H95cm\r\nx W49cm x L100cm | Mattress size: L75cm x W40cm | Tilt: Yes | Rocks:\r\nYes | Height positions: 7 | Washable mattress cover: Machine washable\r\nThe latest iteration of Snuz's much-loved bedside crib, the Snuzpod4\r\nfeatures a new breathable system (called ComfortAir) that aids the flow of\r\nair around the crib and your baby. It offers more side vents, breathable\r\nmesh liner and mattress, plus a ventilated base.\r\nBut the key thing that we're delighted to see is that the Snuzpod4 has a\r\nfirmer mattress than previous versions \u2013 as well as good breathability.\r\nPlus Snuz claims that the SnuzPod4 fits more bed heights than any rival, as\r\nit will now work with beds up to a maximum adult mattress height of\r\n73cm. It's also designed to be compatible with a range of bed types \u2013\r\ndivan, ottoman and framed bed bases.\r\nMade from sustainably sourced beech solid wood, the Snuzpod4 looks\r\ngood. MFM mum home tester Mehack commented on \"how stylish and\r\ncontemporary the design is,\" praising how it \"fits perfectly with the room\r\ndecor\".\r\nWe love its versatility \u2013 the two-part design includes a lift-off bassinet that\r\ncan be moved around the house so you have a portable safe sleeping\r\nspace for your baby, whichever room you're in. The bassinet also has a\r\nmanual rocking function, as does the crib and the bassinet. There's an\r\noptional riser that can be added to create a slight incline to help babies\r\nwith reflux, but for safety reasons, when the cot is tilted this stops the\r\nrocking function from working.\r\nPros: Stylish, removable bassinet, great storage\r\nCons: Can be difficult to put together\r\nRead our full MadeForMums SnuzPod 4 bedside crib review\r\nAvailable from: Snuz, Samuel Johnston and Amazon\r\nVery.co.uk \u00a3159.99 Buy now\r\nSamuel Johnston \u00a3190.18 Buy now\r\nAmazon UK \u00a3199.95 Buy now\r\nJohn Lewis & Partners \u00a3199.95 Buy now\r\n3. Tutti Bambini CoZee Air Bedside Crib, \u00a3225\r\n\u2013 Best for smooth rocking\r\nSuitable from: Birth to 6 months/9kg | Weight: 11kg | Crib size: H92cm x\r\nW12cm x L56cm | Mattress size: L80.5cm x W51cm | Tilt: Yes | Rocks: Yes\r\n| Height positions: 6 | Washable mattress cover: Sponge, only machine\r\nwash if necessary\r\nWhile it is at the more expensive end of the market, what makes the\r\nCoZee Air stand out from the competition is its smooth rocking function. It\r\ncomes with easy-to-remove caster wheels that you can switch with rocking\r\nbars, which easily attach to the legs of the crib. As a safety feature, the\r\nCoZee can also only be rocked when it is set up as a standalone crib \u2013\r\nwhen used as a bedside crib, it has flip-out feet that prevent it from doing\r\nso. \u201cThe rocking feature is fantastic and really helped me to settle my baby\r\nwhen she was overtired and fussing,\u201d said MFM tester Tara.\r\nMFM testers also rated the crib highly for its portability \u2013 it is ideal as a\r\ntravel cot, as despite its large size, it is compact when folded. A 30-second\r\nopen-fold mechanism allows for a quick set up and it comes with a travel\r\nbag for easy transportation.\r\nWhile the multiple mesh windows are great for breathability and being\r\nable to see your little one, there's a curtain attached to one side of the crib\r\nthat you can roll down to protect your baby from draughts during colder\r\nmonths. This still leaves one mesh side open to allow for plenty of air flow.\r\nWhen it comes to cleaning, the fabric lining can be removed and put in the\r\nwashing machine, while the foam mattress can be machine washed if\r\nnecessary. We also like the addition of a storage shelf that is useful for\r\nholding essentials such as baby wipes, nappies, clothes and muslins.\r\nPros: Smooth rocking, quick to collapse down, storage shelf\r\nCons: Higher price point\r\nRead our full MadeForMums Tutti Bambini CoZee Air Bedside Crib review\r\nAvailable from: Boots, Kiddies Kingdom and Tutti Bambini\r\nKiddies Kingdom \u00a3165.00 Buy now\r\nFor Your Little One \u00a3180.00 Buy now\r\nWayfair \u00a3186.63 Buy now\r\nDunelm \u00a3219.00 Buy now\r\n4. Shnuggle Air Bedside crib, \u00a3180\r\n\u2013 Best for longevity\r\nSuitable from: Birth to 6 months/9kg (up to 2 years with conversion kit) |\r\nWeight: 13.4kg | Crib size: H68.5\u201383cm x W56cm x L94cm | Mattress size:\r\nL83cm x W50cm | Tilt: Yes | Rocks: No | Height positions: 7 | Washable\r\nmattress cover: Hand wash\r\nWhile most bedside cribs on the market are only suitable for babies up to\r\n6 months old, the Shnuggle Air stands out by offering 3 products in 1. It\r\ncan be used as a standalone cot or bedside sleeper and then it transforms\r\nafter 6 months into a full-sized cot when you buy the additional\r\nconversion kit (\u00a3109.95) and cot mattress (\u00a350), which will last your child\r\nup until around 2 years old. This makes it a great long-term investment.\r\nMFM judges and testers were particularly impressed with the firmness of\r\nits hypo-allergenic airflow mattress. This crib has dual-view mesh sides,\r\ngiving it maximum breathability; this also means you can easily see your\r\nbaby when both sides are up. This was also a feature that stood out to\r\nMFM reviewer Tara, who used it with her 6-month-old daughter Elodie.\r\nShe said, \u201cElodie slept very soundly and she loved being able to see\r\nthrough the mesh sides.\u201d\r\nThe drop-down sides are easily removed for nighttime access by releasing\r\nthe safety catch on the top bar and undoing the zips. However, during the\r\nawards testing, it was noted that the safety catch makes a loud click. This\r\nwas echoed by a MFM user reviewer who said: \u201cThe side makes a noise\r\nwhen you click it back in and that can wake up baby!\u201d Unlike most of the\r\nothers on this list, the side of the Shnuggle Air cannot be left down during\r\nsleep, it's simply there for access.\r\nThe Shnuggle Air is relatively heavy at 13.4kg, and doesn't have wheels, so\r\nit's not easy to move around your home. \u201cI\u2019d say once the Shnuggle Air is\r\nset up, it\u2019s staying put,\u201d Tara added.\r\nPros: Long-lasting, highly breathable, spacious\r\nCons: Not easily portable, side is noisy when released, hand wash only\r\nRead our full MadeForMums Shnuggle Air Bedside Crib review\r\nAvailable from: Amazon, John Lewis and Shnuggle\r\nJohn Lewis & Partners \u00a3180.00 Buy now\r\nAmazon UK \u00a3199.95 Buy now\r\nKiddies Kingdom \u00a3299.00 Buy now\r\n5.

She said: \u201cThe Iora allowed me to sleep as close to my daughter as\r\npossible, but I was also safe in the knowledge that she was in her own\r\nsleeping area and I wasn't going to squash her!\u201d\r\nThis crib is extremely straightforward to assemble (one of the quickest\r\nduring MFM testing) and MFM reviewer Georgina managed to put it\r\ntogether speedily without using the instructions. She explained: \u201cIt was\r\nobvious which pieces go together, simple to build and had neat zips to\r\nkeep everything in place.\u201d A handy bag also means it can easily be used as\r\na travel cot, especially as it folds down flat.

Indeed, since the Back To Sleep campaign was\r\nlaunched in the UK 30 years ago, cases of SIDS (Sudden Infant Death\r\nSyndrome) have fallen by 80%.\r\nWhen using a bedside crib, you should ensure there is no gap between the\r\nadult's and baby's mattress. Your baby\u2019s mattress should be firm and flat,\r\nand sit snugly in the crib with no gaps.\r\nAlso look for a mattress that is breathable. There's a simple test you can\r\ndo for this:\r\nMost cribs come with a mattress as standard, but if you are given the crib\r\nby someone else or buy one second-hand you will need to buy a new\r\nmattress \u2013 even if the existing one appears to be in good condition.\r\nSecond-hand mattresses may increase the risk of SIDS and are less likely\r\nto be supportive after losing their shape over time. Always use the\r\nmattress designed to fit your bedside crib \u2013 most retailers sell them\r\nseparately should you need a replacement.\r\nWhen it comes to a safe sleeping position, place your baby in the crib with\r\ntheir feet at the end of the crib \u2013 called the feet-to-foot position. This\r\nreduces the risk of their face or head slipping down under the covers if\r\nyou're using a blanket.\r\nHow to use tilting and rocking features safely\r\nSome bedside cribs offer a tilt option, which may help babies with\r\ndigestive issues, colic or reflux. If you are going to tilt your baby, you must\r\ndo so with great care and only at a slight angle, to avoid your baby slipping\r\ndown. We recommend speaking to your GP or health visitor for advice\r\nbefore using the tilt function.\r\nTilting (and rocking) can only be used when the bedside crib is set up as a\r\nOur at-home mattress breathability test\r\nPick up the mattress and place it close to your mouth \u2022\r\nBreathe in and see how easy it is to breathe out with the\r\nmattress near your mouth\r\n\u2022\r\nIf it\u2019s easier this should mean the mattress offers good\r\nventilation\r\n\u2022\r\nstandalone crib \u2013 for safety reasons, you should not tilt or rock the crib\r\nwhen the side is down as there is a chance your baby could fall out.\r\nWhat bedding can I use with a bedside crib?\r\nThe Lullaby Trust advises, \u201cFirmly tucked-in sheets and blankets (not above\r\nshoulder height) or a baby sleep bag are safe for a baby to sleep in.\u201d Make\r\nsure you buy the correct size sheets that exactly fit your mattress. You\r\nmay also choose to swaddle a newborn. The Lullaby Trust does not advise\r\nfor or against swaddling, but it does have some basic swaddling guidance.\r\nYou must stop using a swaddle as soon as your baby learns to roll.\r\nNot all baby sleeping bags and swaddles are created equal, so make sure\r\nthe brand you buy adheres to safety standards, is the correct tog for the\r\nroom temperature and season, and is the right size for your baby, so they\r\ncan't slip down inside.\r\nDon\u2019t use any soft or bulky bedding and never use pillows, duvets, baby\r\nbumpers or baby positioners. You should also remove any soft toys from\r\nthe crib before your baby sleeps.\r\nAdvertisement\r\nRead more...\r\nGemma Cartwright\r\nGroup Digital Editor\r\nGemma has two decades of experience in digital content.

Various processing methods are used to attain different levels of oxidation\r\nand produce certain kinds of tea, such as black, white, oolong, green, and pu\u2019erh. Basic\r\nprocessing includes plucking, withering (to wilt and soften the leaves), rolling (to shape\r\nthe leaves and slow drying), oxidizing, and drying. However, depending on the tea type,\r\nsome steps are repeated or omitted. For example, green tea is made by withering and\r\nrolling leaves at a low heat, and oxidation is skipped; for oolong, rolling and oxidizing are\r\nperformed repeatedly; and for black, extensive oxidation (fermentation) is employed.\r\n3.5.1 The Discovery of Tea\r\nTea was discovered in 2700 BCE by the ancient Chinese emperor Shen Nung, who had\r\na keen interest in herbal medicine and introduced the practice of drinking boiled water\r\nto prevent stomach ailments. According to legend, once, when the emperor camped in a\r\nforest during one of his excursions, his servants set up a pot of boiling water under a tree.\r\nA fragrance attracted his attention, and he found that a few dry leaves from the tree had\r\nColonial Agriculture | 53\r\nfallen accidentally into the boiling pot and changed the color of the water; this was the\r\nsource of the aroma. He took a few sips of that water and noticed its stimulative effect\r\ninstantly. The emperor experimented with the leaves of that tree, now called Camellia\r\nsinensis, and thus the drink \u201ccha\u201d came into existence. Initially, it was used as a tonic, but\r\nit became a popular beverage around 350 BCE. The historian Lu Yu of the Tang dynasty\r\n(618\u2013907 CE) has written a poetry book on tea called Cha jing (The Classic of Tea) that\r\ncontains a detailed description of how to cultivate, process, and brew tea.\r\nTea spread to Japan and Korea in the seventh century thanks to Buddhist monks, and\r\ndrinking it became an essential cultural ritual. Formal tea ceremonies soon began.\r\nHowever, tea reached other countries only after the sixteenth century. In 1557, the\r\nPortuguese established their first trading center in Macau, and the Dutch soon followed\r\nsuit. In 1610, some Dutch traders in Macau took tea back to the Dutch royal family as a\r\ngift. The royal family took an immediate liking to it. When the Dutch princess Catherine of\r\nBraganza married King Charles II of England around 1650, she introduced tea to England.\r\nTea passed from the royal family to the nobles, but for an extended period, it remained\r\nunknown and unaffordable to common folks in Europe. The supply of tea in Europe was\r\nscant and very costly: one pound of tea was equal to nine months\u2019 wages for a British\r\nlaborer.\r\nAs European trade with China increased, more tea reached Europe, and consumption of\r\ntea increased proportionally. For example, in 1680, Britain imported a hundred pounds of\r\ntea; however, in 1700, it brought in a million. The British government allowed the British\r\nEast India Company to monopolize the trade, and by 1785, the company was buying 15\r\nmillion pounds of tea from China annually and selling it worldwide. Eventually, in the early\r\neighteenth century, tea reached the homes of British commoners.\r\n3.5.2 Tea and the \u201cOpium War\u201d\r\nChina was self-sufficient; its people wanted nothing from Europe in exchange for tea. But\r\nin Europe, the demand for tea increased rapidly in the mid-eighteenth century. Large\r\nquantities were being purchased, and Europeans had to pay in silver and gold. The East\r\nIndia Company was buying so much of it that it caused a crisis for the mercantilist British\r\neconomy. The company came up with a plan to buy tea in exchange for opium instead of\r\ngold and silver. Although opium was banned within China, it was in demand and sold at\r\nvery high prices on the black market.\r\nAfter the Battle of Plassey in 1757, several northern provinces in India came under the\r\ncontrol of the East India Company, and the company began cultivating poppy in Bengal,\r\nBihar, Orissa, and eastern Uttar Pradesh. Such cultivation was compulsory, and the\r\n54 | Colonial Agriculture\r\ncompany also banned farmers from growing grain and built opium factories in Patna\r\nand Banaras. The opium was then transported to Calcutta for auction before British ships\r\ncarried it to the Chinese border. The East India Company also helped set up an extensive\r\nnetwork of opium smugglers in China, who then transported opium domestically and sold\r\nit on the black market.\r\nAfter the successful establishment of this smuggling network, British ships bought tea on\r\ncredit at the port of Canton (now Guangzhou), China, and later paid for it with opium in\r\nCalcutta (now Kolkata). The company not only acquired the tea that was so in demand but\r\nalso started making huge profits from selling opium. This mixed business of opium and\r\ntea began to strengthen the British economy and made it easier for the British to become\r\nfront-runners among the European powers.\r\nBy the 1830s, British traders were selling 1,400 tons of opium to China every year, and as a\r\nresult, a large number of Chinese became opium addicts. The Chinese government began\r\na crackdown on smugglers and further tightened the laws related to opium, and in 1838,\r\nit imposed death sentences on opium smugglers. Furthermore, despite immense pressure\r\nfrom the East India Company to allow the open trading of opium, the Chinese emperor\r\nwould not capitulate. However, that did not curb his subjects\u2019 addiction and the growing\r\ndemand for opium.\r\nIn 1839, by order of the Chinese emperor, a British ship was detained in the port of Canton,\r\nand the opium therein was destroyed. The British government asked the Chinese emperor\r\nto apologize and demanded compensation; he refused. British retaliated by attacking a\r\nnumber of Chinese ports and coastal cities. China could not compete with Britain\u2019s state-of-\r\nthe-art weapons, and defeated, China accepted the terms of the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842\r\nand the Treaty of Bog in 1843, which opened the ports of Canton, Fujian, and Shanghai,\r\namong others, to British merchants and other Europeans. In 1856, another small war broke\r\nout between China and Britain, which ended with a treaty that made the sale of opium\r\nlegal and allowed Christian missionaries to operate in China. But the tension between\r\nChina and Europe remained. In 1859, the British and French seized Beijing and burned\r\nthe royal Summer Palace. The subsequent Beijing Convention of 1860 ended China\u2019s\r\nsovereignty, and the British gained a monopoly on the tea trade.\r\n3.5.3 The Co-option of Tea and the Establishment of\r\nPlantations in European Colonies\r\nUnlike the British, the Dutch, Portuguese, and French had less success in the tea trade.\r\nTo overcome British domination, the Portuguese planned to develop tea gardens outside\r\nChina. Camellia is native to China, and it was not found in any other country. There was\r\nColonial Agriculture | 55\r\na law against taking these plants out of the country, and the method for processing tea\r\nwas also a trade secret. In the mid-eighteenth century, many Europeans smuggled the\r\nseeds and plants from China, but they were unable to grow them. Then, in 1750, the\r\nPortuguese smuggled the Camellia plants and some trained specialists out of China and\r\nsucceeded in establishing tea gardens in the mountainous regions of the Azores Islands,\r\nwhich have a climate favorable for tea cultivation. With the help of Chinese laborers and\r\nexperts, black and green tea were successfully produced in the Portuguese tea plantations.\r\nSoon, Portugal and its colonies no longer needed to import tea at all. As the owners of the\r\nfirst tea plantations outside China, the Portuguese remained vigilant in protecting their\r\nmonopoly. It was some time before other European powers gained the ability to grow and\r\nprocess tea themselves.\r\nIn the early nineteenth century, the British began exploring the idea of planting tea\r\nsaplings in India. In 1824, Robert Bruce, an officer of the British East India Company, came\r\nacross a variety of tea popular among the Singpho clan of Assam, India. He used this variety\r\nto develop the first tea garden in the Chauba area of Assam, and in 1840, the Assam Tea\r\nCompany began production. This success was instrumental to the establishment of tea\r\nestates throughout India and in other British colonies.\r\nIn 1848, the East India Company hired Robert Fortune, a plant hunter, to smuggle tea\r\nsaplings and information about tea processing from China. Fortune was the\r\nsuperintendent of the hothouse department of the British Horticultural Society in\r\nCheswick, London. He had visited China three times before this assignment; the first, in\r\n1843, had been sponsored by the horticultural society, which was interested in acquiring\r\nimportant botanical treasures from China by exploiting the opportunity offered by the\r\n1842 Treaty of Nanking after the First Opium War. Fortune managed to visit the interior of\r\nChina (where foreigners were forbidden) and also gathered valuable information about the\r\ncultivation of important plants, successfully smuggling over 120 plant species into Britain.\r\nIn the autumn of 1848, Fortune entered China and traveled for nearly three years while\r\ncarefully collecting information related to tea cultivation and processing. He noted that\r\nblack and green teas were made from the leaves of the same plant, Camellia sinensis,\r\nexcept that the former was \u201cfermented\u201d for a longer period. Eventually, Fortune succeeded\r\nin smuggling 20,000 saplings of Camellia sinensis to Calcutta, India, in Wardian cases.4\r\n4. The Wardian case, a precursor to the modern terrarium, was a special type of sealed glass box made\r\nby British doctor Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward in 1829. The delicate plants within them could thrive for\r\nmonths. Plant hunter Joseph Hooker successfully used Wardian cases to bring some plants from the\r\nAntarctic to England. In 1933, Nathaniel Ward also succeeded in sending hundreds of small\r\nornamental plants from England to Australia in these boxes. After two years, another voyage carried\r\n56 | Colonial Agriculture\r\nHe also brought trained artisans from China to India. These plants and artisans were\r\ntransported from Calcutta to Darjeeling, Assam. At Darjeeling, a nursery was set up for the\r\npropagation of tea saplings at a large scale, supplying plantlets to all the tea gardens in\r\nIndia, Sri Lanka, and other British colonies.\r\nThe British forced the poor tribal population of the Assam, Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa\r\nprovinces out of their land, and they were sent to work in tea estates. Tamils from the\r\nsouthern province of India were also sent to work in the tea plantation of Sri Lanka. Tea\r\nplantations were modeled on the sugar colonies of the Caribbean, and thus the plight of\r\nthe workers was in some ways similar to that of the slaves from Caribbean plantations.\r\nSamuel Davidson\u2019s Sirocco tea dryer, the first tea-processing machine, was introduced in Sri\r\nLanka in 1877, followed by John Walker\u2019s tea-rolling machine in 1880. These machines were\r\nsoon adopted by tea estates in India and other British colonies as well. As a result, British\r\ntea production increased greatly. By 1888, India became the number-one exporter of tea to\r\nBritain, sending the country 86 million pounds of tea.\r\nAfter India, Sri Lanka became prime ground for tea plantations. In the last decades of the\r\nnineteenth century, an outbreak of the fungal pathogen Hemilia vastatrix, a causal agent\r\nof rust, resulted in the destruction of the coffee plantations in Sri Lanka. The British owners\r\nof those estates quickly opted to plant tea instead, and a decade later, tea plantations\r\ncovered nearly 400,000 acres of land in Sri Lanka. By 1927, Sri Lanka alone produced 100,000\r\ntons per year. All this tea was for export. Within the British Empire, fermented black tea was\r\nproduced, for which Assam, Ceylon, and Darjeeling tea are still famous. Black tea produced\r\nin India and Sri Lanka was considered of lesser quality than Chinese tea, but it was very\r\ncheap and easily became popular in Asian and African countries. In addition to India and\r\nCeylon, British planters introduced tea plantations to fifty other countries.\r\n3.6 The Story of Coffee\r\nCoffee is made from the roasted seeds of the coffee plant, a shrub belonging to the\r\nRubiaceae family of flowering plants. There are over 120 species in the genus Coffea, and\r\nall are of tropical African origin. Only Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora are used for\r\nmaking coffee.

Hence the local custom of eating raw coffee berries began.

As a result, rust disease destroyed the coffee plantations one by one. Later, in\r\nsome of the coffee plantations, Coffea canephora (syn. Coffea robusta), which has a natural\r\nresistance to rust, was planted, but others were converted into tea plantations (as in the\r\ncase of Sri Lanka, discussed earlier).\r\nEuropean coffee plantations used the same model as tea or sugar plantations, and so\r\ntheir workers lived under the same conditions. European powers forcefully employed the\r\npoor native population in these plantations and used indentured laborers as needed. For\r\nexample, in Sri Lanka, the Sinhalese population refused to work in the coffee farms, so\r\nBritish planters recruited 100,000 indentured Tamil workers from India to work the farms\r\nand tea plantations there.\r\n3.7 The Heritage of Plantations\r\nIn the twentieth century, most former European colonies became independent countries.\r\nIn these countries, private, cooperative, or semigovernmental institutions manage\r\nplantations of sugarcane, tea, coffee, or other commercial crops.

According to legend, once, when the emperor camped in a\r\nforest during one of his excursions, his servants set up a pot of boiling water under a tree.\r\nA fragrance attracted his attention, and he found that a few dry leaves from the tree had\r\nColonial Agriculture | 53\r\nfallen accidentally into the boiling pot and changed the color of the water; this was the\r\nsource of the aroma. He took a few sips of that water and noticed its stimulative effect\r\ninstantly. The emperor experimented with the leaves of that tree, now called Camellia\r\nsinensis, and thus the drink \u201ccha\u201d came into existence. Initially, it was used as a tonic, but\r\nit became a popular beverage around 350 BCE. The historian Lu Yu of the Tang dynasty\r\n(618\u2013907 CE) has written a poetry book on tea called Cha jing (The Classic of Tea) that\r\ncontains a detailed description of how to cultivate, process, and brew tea.\r\nTea spread to Japan and Korea in the seventh century thanks to Buddhist monks, and\r\ndrinking it became an essential cultural ritual. Formal tea ceremonies soon began.\r\nHowever, tea reached other countries only after the sixteenth century. In 1557, the\r\nPortuguese established their first trading center in Macau, and the Dutch soon followed\r\nsuit. In 1610, some Dutch traders in Macau took tea back to the Dutch royal family as a\r\ngift. The royal family took an immediate liking to it. When the Dutch princess Catherine of\r\nBraganza married King Charles II of England around 1650, she introduced tea to England.\r\nTea passed from the royal family to the nobles, but for an extended period, it remained\r\nunknown and unaffordable to common folks in Europe. The supply of tea in Europe was\r\nscant and very costly: one pound of tea was equal to nine months\u2019 wages for a British\r\nlaborer.\r\nAs European trade with China increased, more tea reached Europe, and consumption of\r\ntea increased proportionally. For example, in 1680, Britain imported a hundred pounds of\r\ntea; however, in 1700, it brought in a million. The British government allowed the British\r\nEast India Company to monopolize the trade, and by 1785, the company was buying 15\r\nmillion pounds of tea from China annually and selling it worldwide. Eventually, in the early\r\neighteenth century, tea reached the homes of British commoners.\r\n3.5.2 Tea and the \u201cOpium War\u201d\r\nChina was self-sufficient; its people wanted nothing from Europe in exchange for tea. But\r\nin Europe, the demand for tea increased rapidly in the mid-eighteenth century. Large\r\nquantities were being purchased, and Europeans had to pay in silver and gold. The East\r\nIndia Company was buying so much of it that it caused a crisis for the mercantilist British\r\neconomy. The company came up with a plan to buy tea in exchange for opium instead of\r\ngold and silver. Although opium was banned within China, it was in demand and sold at\r\nvery high prices on the black market.\r\nAfter the Battle of Plassey in 1757, several northern provinces in India came under the\r\ncontrol of the East India Company, and the company began cultivating poppy in Bengal,\r\nBihar, Orissa, and eastern Uttar Pradesh. Such cultivation was compulsory, and the\r\n54 | Colonial Agriculture\r\ncompany also banned farmers from growing grain and built opium factories in Patna\r\nand Banaras. The opium was then transported to Calcutta for auction before British ships\r\ncarried it to the Chinese border. The East India Company also helped set up an extensive\r\nnetwork of opium smugglers in China, who then transported opium domestically and sold\r\nit on the black market.\r\nAfter the successful establishment of this smuggling network, British ships bought tea on\r\ncredit at the port of Canton (now Guangzhou), China, and later paid for it with opium in\r\nCalcutta (now Kolkata). The company not only acquired the tea that was so in demand but\r\nalso started making huge profits from selling opium. This mixed business of opium and\r\ntea began to strengthen the British economy and made it easier for the British to become\r\nfront-runners among the European powers.\r\nBy the 1830s, British traders were selling 1,400 tons of opium to China every year, and as a\r\nresult, a large number of Chinese became opium addicts. The Chinese government began\r\na crackdown on smugglers and further tightened the laws related to opium, and in 1838,\r\nit imposed death sentences on opium smugglers. Furthermore, despite immense pressure\r\nfrom the East India Company to allow the open trading of opium, the Chinese emperor\r\nwould not capitulate. However, that did not curb his subjects\u2019 addiction and the growing\r\ndemand for opium.\r\nIn 1839, by order of the Chinese emperor, a British ship was detained in the port of Canton,\r\nand the opium therein was destroyed. The British government asked the Chinese emperor\r\nto apologize and demanded compensation; he refused. British retaliated by attacking a\r\nnumber of Chinese ports and coastal cities. China could not compete with Britain\u2019s state-of-\r\nthe-art weapons, and defeated, China accepted the terms of the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842\r\nand the Treaty of Bog in 1843, which opened the ports of Canton, Fujian, and Shanghai,\r\namong others, to British merchants and other Europeans. In 1856, another small war broke\r\nout between China and Britain, which ended with a treaty that made the sale of opium\r\nlegal and allowed Christian missionaries to operate in China. But the tension between\r\nChina and Europe remained. In 1859, the British and French seized Beijing and burned\r\nthe royal Summer Palace. The subsequent Beijing Convention of 1860 ended China\u2019s\r\nsovereignty, and the British gained a monopoly on the tea trade.\r\n3.5.3 The Co-option of Tea and the Establishment of\r\nPlantations in European Colonies\r\nUnlike the British, the Dutch, Portuguese, and French had less success in the tea trade.\r\nTo overcome British domination, the Portuguese planned to develop tea gardens outside\r\nChina. Camellia is native to China, and it was not found in any other country. There was\r\nColonial Agriculture | 55\r\na law against taking these plants out of the country, and the method for processing tea\r\nwas also a trade secret. In the mid-eighteenth century, many Europeans smuggled the\r\nseeds and plants from China, but they were unable to grow them. Then, in 1750, the\r\nPortuguese smuggled the Camellia plants and some trained specialists out of China and\r\nsucceeded in establishing tea gardens in the mountainous regions of the Azores Islands,\r\nwhich have a climate favorable for tea cultivation. With the help of Chinese laborers and\r\nexperts, black and green tea were successfully produced in the Portuguese tea plantations.\r\nSoon, Portugal and its colonies no longer needed to import tea at all. As the owners of the\r\nfirst tea plantations outside China, the Portuguese remained vigilant in protecting their\r\nmonopoly. It was some time before other European powers gained the ability to grow and\r\nprocess tea themselves.\r\nIn the early nineteenth century, the British began exploring the idea of planting tea\r\nsaplings in India. In 1824, Robert Bruce, an officer of the British East India Company, came\r\nacross a variety of tea popular among the Singpho clan of Assam, India. He used this variety\r\nto develop the first tea garden in the Chauba area of Assam, and in 1840, the Assam Tea\r\nCompany began production. This success was instrumental to the establishment of tea\r\nestates throughout India and in other British colonies.\r\nIn 1848, the East India Company hired Robert Fortune, a plant hunter, to smuggle tea\r\nsaplings and information about tea processing from China. Fortune was the\r\nsuperintendent of the hothouse department of the British Horticultural Society in\r\nCheswick, London. He had visited China three times before this assignment; the first, in\r\n1843, had been sponsored by the horticultural society, which was interested in acquiring\r\nimportant botanical treasures from China by exploiting the opportunity offered by the\r\n1842 Treaty of Nanking after the First Opium War. Fortune managed to visit the interior of\r\nChina (where foreigners were forbidden) and also gathered valuable information about the\r\ncultivation of important plants, successfully smuggling over 120 plant species into Britain.\r\nIn the autumn of 1848, Fortune entered China and traveled for nearly three years while\r\ncarefully collecting information related to tea cultivation and processing. He noted that\r\nblack and green teas were made from the leaves of the same plant, Camellia sinensis,\r\nexcept that the former was \u201cfermented\u201d for a longer period. Eventually, Fortune succeeded\r\nin smuggling 20,000 saplings of Camellia sinensis to Calcutta, India, in Wardian cases.4\r\n4. The Wardian case, a precursor to the modern terrarium, was a special type of sealed glass box made\r\nby British doctor Nathaniel Bagshaw Ward in 1829. The delicate plants within them could thrive for\r\nmonths. Plant hunter Joseph Hooker successfully used Wardian cases to bring some plants from the\r\nAntarctic to England. In 1933, Nathaniel Ward also succeeded in sending hundreds of small\r\nornamental plants from England to Australia in these boxes. After two years, another voyage carried\r\n56 | Colonial Agriculture\r\nHe also brought trained artisans from China to India. These plants and artisans were\r\ntransported from Calcutta to Darjeeling, Assam. At Darjeeling, a nursery was set up for the\r\npropagation of tea saplings at a large scale, supplying plantlets to all the tea gardens in\r\nIndia, Sri Lanka, and other British colonies.\r\nThe British forced the poor tribal population of the Assam, Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa\r\nprovinces out of their land, and they were sent to work in tea estates. Tamils from the\r\nsouthern province of India were also sent to work in the tea plantation of Sri Lanka. Tea\r\nplantations were modeled on the sugar colonies of the Caribbean, and thus the plight of\r\nthe workers was in some ways similar to that of the slaves from Caribbean plantations.\r\nSamuel Davidson\u2019s Sirocco tea dryer, the first tea-processing machine, was introduced in Sri\r\nLanka in 1877, followed by John Walker\u2019s tea-rolling machine in 1880. These machines were\r\nsoon adopted by tea estates in India and other British colonies as well. As a result, British\r\ntea production increased greatly. By 1888, India became the number-one exporter of tea to\r\nBritain, sending the country 86 million pounds of tea.\r\nAfter India, Sri Lanka became prime ground for tea plantations. In the last decades of the\r\nnineteenth century, an outbreak of the fungal pathogen Hemilia vastatrix, a causal agent\r\nof rust, resulted in the destruction of the coffee plantations in Sri Lanka. The British owners\r\nof those estates quickly opted to plant tea instead, and a decade later, tea plantations\r\ncovered nearly 400,000 acres of land in Sri Lanka. By 1927, Sri Lanka alone produced 100,000\r\ntons per year. All this tea was for export. Within the British Empire, fermented black tea was\r\nproduced, for which Assam, Ceylon, and Darjeeling tea are still famous. Black tea produced\r\nin India and Sri Lanka was considered of lesser quality than Chinese tea, but it was very\r\ncheap and easily became popular in Asian and African countries. In addition to India and\r\nCeylon, British planters introduced tea plantations to fifty other countries.\r\n3.6 The Story of Coffee\r\nCoffee is made from the roasted seeds of the coffee plant, a shrub belonging to the\r\nRubiaceae family of flowering plants. There are over 120 species in the genus Coffea, and\r\nall are of tropical African origin. Only Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora are used for\r\nmaking coffee. Coffea arabica (figure 3.10) is preferred for its sweeter taste and is the\r\nsource of 60\u201380 percent of the world\u2019s coffee.

Coffea robusta), which has a natural\r\nresistance to rust, was planted, but others were converted into tea plantations (as in the\r\ncase of Sri Lanka, discussed earlier).\r\nEuropean coffee plantations used the same model as tea or sugar plantations, and so\r\ntheir workers lived under the same conditions. European powers forcefully employed the\r\npoor native population in these plantations and used indentured laborers as needed. For\r\nexample, in Sri Lanka, the Sinhalese population refused to work in the coffee farms, so\r\nBritish planters recruited 100,000 indentured Tamil workers from India to work the farms\r\nand tea plantations there.\r\n3.7 The Heritage of Plantations\r\nIn the twentieth century, most former European colonies became independent countries.\r\nIn these countries, private, cooperative, or semigovernmental institutions manage\r\nplantations of sugarcane, tea, coffee, or other commercial crops. Though these plantations\r\nremain a significant source of revenue and contribute significantly to the national GDP of\r\nmany countries, their workers still often operate under abject conditions.\r\nReferences\r\nJohannessen, C.

Of course, you typically don't need to do that. And in many cases, the usual strategy is to close out a position ahead of the expiration date. We'll revisit the close-or-hold decision in the next section and look at ways to do that. But assuming you do carry the options position until the end, there are a few things you need to consider:\n \n\n Know your specs. Each standard equity options contract controls 100 shares of the underlying stock. That's pretty straightforward. Non-standard options may have different deliverables. Non-standard options can represent a different number of shares, shares of more than one company stock, or underlying shares and cash. Other products\u2014such as index options or options on futures\u2014have different contract specs.\n Stock and options positions will match and close. Suppose you're long 300 shares of XYZ and short one ITM call that's assigned. Because the call is deliverable into 100 shares, you'll be left with 200 shares of XYZ if the option is assigned, plus the cash from selling 100 shares at the strike price.\n It's automatic, for the most part. If an option is ITM by as little as $0.01 at expiration, it will automatically be exercised for the buyer and assigned to a seller. However, there's something called a do not exercise (DNE) request that a long option holder can submit if they want to abandon an option. In such a case, it's possible that a short ITM position might not be assigned. For more, see the note below on pin risk7?\n You'd better have enough cash. If an option on XYZ is exercised or assigned and you are \"uncovered\" (you don't have an existing long or short position in the underlying security), a long or short position in the underlying stock will replace the options. A long call or short put will result in a long position in XYZ; a short call or long put will result in a short position in XYZ. For long stock positions, you need to have enough cash to cover the purchase or else you'll be issued a margin8 call, which you must meet by adding funds to your account. But that timeline may be short, and the broker, at its discretion, has the right to liquidate positions in your account to meet a margin call9. If exercise or assignment involves taking a short stock position, you need a margin account and sufficient funds in the account to cover the margin requirement.\n Short equity positions are risky business. An uncovered short call or long put, if assigned or exercised, will result in a short stock position. If you're short a stock, you have potentially unlimited risk because there's theoretically no limit to the potential price increase of the underlying stock. There's also no guarantee the brokerage firm can continue to maintain that short position for an unlimited time period. So, if you're a newbie, it's generally inadvisable to carry an options position into expiration if there's a chance you might end up with a short stock position.\n A note on pin risk: It's not common, but occasionally a stock settles right on a strike price at expiration. So, if you were short the 105-strike calls and XYZ settled at exactly $105, there would be no automatic assignment, but depending on the actions taken by the option holder, you may or may not be assigned\u2014and you may not be able to trade out of any unwanted positions until the next business day.\n \n\n But it goes beyond the exact price issue. What if an option is ITM as of the market close, but news comes out after the close (but before the exercise decision deadline) that sends the stock price up or down through the strike price? Remember: The owner of the option could submit a DNE request.\n \n\n The uncertainty and potential exposure when a stock price and the strike price are the same at expiration is called pin risk. The best way to avoid it is to close the position before expiration.\n \n\n The decision tree: How to approach expiration\n As expiration approaches, you have three choices. Depending on the circumstances\u2014and your objectives and risk tolerance\u2014any of these might be the best decision for you.\n \n\n 1. Let the chips fall where they may. Some positions may not require as much maintenance. An options position that's deeply OTM will likely go away on its own, but occasionally an option that's been left for dead springs back to life. If it's a long option, the unexpected turn of events might feel like a windfall; if it's a short option that could've been closed out for a penny or two, you might be kicking yourself for not doing so.\n \n\n 2. Close it out. If you've met your objectives for a trade, then it might be time to close it out. Otherwise, you might be exposed to risks that aren't commensurate with any added return potential (like the short option that could've been closed out for next to nothing, then suddenly came back into play).

{"system_instruction": "Present the answers in a table with bullet points. Only use the information provided.", "user_request": "Summarise the different nanoparticles by giving 3 benefits of each and any indication of the type of diabetes they best treat.", "context_document": "3.1. Using nanotechnology to treat diabetes mellitus Recent advances in diabetes research have been leveraged by nanotechnology to develop cutting-edge glucose measurement and insulin delivery techniques with the potential to significantly enhance the well-being of diabetes patients. This analysis delves into the intersection of nanotechnology and diabetes research, specifically focusing on the developmental of glucose sensors utilizing nanoscale elements like metal nanoparticles and carbon nanostructures. These tiny components have been proven to enhance the sensitivity and response time of glucose sensors, enabling continuous monitoring of glucose levels within the body. Additionally, the review delves into the nanoscale strategies for creating \u201cclosed-loop\u201d insulin delivery systems that automatically adjust insulin release based on blood glucose changes. By integrating blood glucose measurements with insulin administration, these systems aim to reduce the need for patient intervention, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes and overall quality of life for individuals with diabetes mellitus [17]. \n3.2. The use of nanoparticles in biology for treating diabetes mellitus Nanotechnology has emerged as a valuable tool for a range of biomedical uses in recent years. Nanoparticles, which are materials with sizes smaller than 100 nm in at least one dimension, have distinct characteristics that change when scaled down to the nanoscale. This enables them to interact with cellular biomolecules in a specific manner. NPs engineered for precise cell delivery carry therapeutic substances [18]. Moreover, metal nanoparticles are perceived as being less harmful than mineral salts and provide numerous advantages to the body [19].\n\n\n3.2.1. Zinc oxide NPs ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) find uses in a range of biomedical applications, including treating diabetes, fighting bacteria, combating cancer and fungal infections, delivering drugs, and reducing inflammation [20]. Zinc is crucial for the biosynthesis, secretion, and storage of insulin, with zinc transporters like zinc transporter-8 being vital for insulin release from pancreatic beta cells [21]. ZnO NPs can boost insulin signaling by enhancing insulin receptor phosphorylation and phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity [22]. Research indicates that ZnO NPs can repair pancreatic tissue damaged by diabetes, improving blood sugar and serum insulin levels. Studies comparing ZnO NPs with standard antidiabetic drugs like Vildagliptin show that ZnO NPs are effective in treating type 2 diabetes [23]. ZnO NPs have shown notable antidiabetic activity in various animal models, often surpassing other treatments. They also have powerful biological effects, such as acting as antioxidants and reducing inflammation, which makes them potential candidates for treating diabetes and its related complications [24]. 3.2.2. Magnesium NPs Magnesium (Mg) is essential for glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion, Contribution to the process of adding phosphate groups to molecules and regulating the breakdown of glucose through a variety of enzymes [19]. Mg deficiency can result in insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and complications in diabetic mice [25]. A study by Kei et al. (2020) demonstrated that MgO nanoparticles can help reduce blood sugar levels, improve insulin sensitivity, and regulate lipid levels in diabetic mice. The study found that using the polymer-directed aptamer (DPAP) system efficiently delivered MgO NPs to diabetic target cells, leading to reduced sugar oxidation. This suggests that magnesium, particularly in the form of MgO NPs, may be a promising treatment for type II diabetes [26]. 3.2.3. Cerium oxide NPs The rare earth element cerium, found in the lanthanide series, forms CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) that have shown potential in treating oxidative disorders and brain injuries. Research indicates that CeO2 NPs could serve as a regenerative agent, preventing nerve damage caused by diabetes and treating diabetic neuropathy [27]. Additionally, CeO2 NPs may help reduce complications from gestational diabetes. However, further research is needed to validate these findings [28].\n3.2.4. Copper NPs Copper is a crucial transitional element involved in various biochemical processes. Copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) are effective in treating Type 2 diabetes due to their superior antioxidant properties and their ability to inhibit alphaamylase and alpha-glucosidase [29]. Additionally, Cu NPs have been shown to significantly prevent cardiovascular defects in diabetic individuals by enhancing nitric oxide availability in the vascular endothelium and reducing oxidative stress. Research indicates that Cu NPs also aid in wound healing in diabetic mice, accelerating recovery and controlling bacterial infections. Overall, Cu NPs show potential benefits for diabetes patients [30]. 3.2.5. Selenium NPs Selenium is a vital trace element found in many plants, and its deficit can result in health issues like diabetes [31]. Selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) are less toxic and have antioxidant properties that help scavenge peroxides and protect cellular macromolecules. Studies indicate that Se NPs can assist in managing T2DM by preserving the authenticity of pancreatic \u03b2-cells, boosting insulin secretion, and reducing glucose levels. Additionally, they enhance liver function and lower inflammatory markers. Overall, Se NPs hold promise as a treatment for diabetes and insulin resistance, effectively mitigating related complications while maintaining a balance between oxidative and antioxidant processes [32].", "full_prompt": "Summarise the different nanoparticles by giving 3 benefits of each and any indication of the type of diabetes they best treat. \n\n\nPresent the answers in a table with bullet points. Only use the information provided. \n\n\n3.1. Using nanotechnology to treat diabetes mellitus Recent advances in diabetes research have been leveraged by nanotechnology to develop cutting-edge glucose measurement and insulin delivery techniques with the potential to significantly enhance the well-being of diabetes patients. This analysis delves into the intersection of nanotechnology and diabetes research, specifically focusing on the developmental of glucose sensors utilizing nanoscale elements like metal nanoparticles and carbon nanostructures. These tiny components have been proven to enhance the sensitivity and response time of glucose sensors, enabling continuous monitoring of glucose levels within the body. Additionally, the review delves into the nanoscale strategies for creating \u201cclosed-loop\u201d insulin delivery systems that automatically adjust insulin release based on blood glucose changes. By integrating blood glucose measurements with insulin administration, these systems aim to reduce the need for patient intervention, ultimately leading to improved health outcomes and overall quality of life for individuals with diabetes mellitus [17]. \n3.2. The use of nanoparticles in biology for treating diabetes mellitus Nanotechnology has emerged as a valuable tool for a range of biomedical uses in recent years. Nanoparticles, which are materials with sizes smaller than 100 nm in at least one dimension, have distinct characteristics that change when scaled down to the nanoscale. This enables them to interact with cellular biomolecules in a specific manner. NPs engineered for precise cell delivery carry therapeutic substances [18]. Moreover, metal nanoparticles are perceived as being less harmful than mineral salts and provide numerous advantages to the body [19].\n\n\n3.2.1. Zinc oxide NPs ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) find uses in a range of biomedical applications, including treating diabetes, fighting bacteria, combating cancer and fungal infections, delivering drugs, and reducing inflammation [20]. Zinc is crucial for the biosynthesis, secretion, and storage of insulin, with zinc transporters like zinc transporter-8 being vital for insulin release from pancreatic beta cells [21]. ZnO NPs can boost insulin signaling by enhancing insulin receptor phosphorylation and phosphoinositide 3-kinase activity [22]. Research indicates that ZnO NPs can repair pancreatic tissue damaged by diabetes, improving blood sugar and serum insulin levels. Studies comparing ZnO NPs with standard antidiabetic drugs like Vildagliptin show that ZnO NPs are effective in treating type 2 diabetes [23]. ZnO NPs have shown notable antidiabetic activity in various animal models, often surpassing other treatments. They also have powerful biological effects, such as acting as antioxidants and reducing inflammation, which makes them potential candidates for treating diabetes and its related complications [24]. 3.2.2. Magnesium NPs Magnesium (Mg) is essential for glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion, Contribution to the process of adding phosphate groups to molecules and regulating the breakdown of glucose through a variety of enzymes [19]. Mg deficiency can result in insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and complications in diabetic mice [25]. A study by Kei et al. (2020) demonstrated that MgO nanoparticles can help reduce blood sugar levels, improve insulin sensitivity, and regulate lipid levels in diabetic mice. The study found that using the polymer-directed aptamer (DPAP) system efficiently delivered MgO NPs to diabetic target cells, leading to reduced sugar oxidation. This suggests that magnesium, particularly in the form of MgO NPs, may be a promising treatment for type II diabetes [26]. 3.2.3. Cerium oxide NPs The rare earth element cerium, found in the lanthanide series, forms CeO2 nanoparticles (NPs) that have shown potential in treating oxidative disorders and brain injuries. Research indicates that CeO2 NPs could serve as a regenerative agent, preventing nerve damage caused by diabetes and treating diabetic neuropathy [27]. Additionally, CeO2 NPs may help reduce complications from gestational diabetes. However, further research is needed to validate these findings [28].\n3.2.4. Copper NPs Copper is a crucial transitional element involved in various biochemical processes. Copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) are effective in treating Type 2 diabetes due to their superior antioxidant properties and their ability to inhibit alphaamylase and alpha-glucosidase [29]. Additionally, Cu NPs have been shown to significantly prevent cardiovascular defects in diabetic individuals by enhancing nitric oxide availability in the vascular endothelium and reducing oxidative stress. Research indicates that Cu NPs also aid in wound healing in diabetic mice, accelerating recovery and controlling bacterial infections. Overall, Cu NPs show potential benefits for diabetes patients [30]. 3.2.5. Selenium NPs Selenium is a vital trace element found in many plants, and its deficit can result in health issues like diabetes [31]. Selenium nanoparticles (Se NPs) are less toxic and have antioxidant properties that help scavenge peroxides and protect cellular macromolecules. Studies indicate that Se NPs can assist in managing T2DM by preserving the authenticity of pancreatic \u03b2-cells, boosting insulin secretion, and reducing glucose levels. Additionally, they enhance liver function and lower inflammatory markers. Overall, Se NPs hold promise as a treatment for diabetes and insulin resistance, effectively mitigating related complications while maintaining a balance between oxidative and antioxidant processes [32].\n"}

But like all LLMs, Gemini can sometimes confidently and convincingly generate responses that contain inaccurate or misleading information. Since LLMs work by predicting the next word or sequences of words, they are not yet fully capable of distinguishing between accurate and inaccurate information on their own.

We continue to research how to use this data in a way that ensures that an LLM\u2019s response incorporates a wide range of viewpoints, while minimizing inaccurate overgeneralizations and biases. Gaps, biases, and overgeneralizations in training data can be reflected in a model\u2019s outputs as it tries to predict likely responses to a prompt. We see these issues manifest in a number of ways (e.g., responses that reflect only one culture or demographic, reference problematic overgeneralizations, exhibit gender, religious, or ethnic biases, or promote only one point of view).

Gemini should not respond in a way that endorses a particular viewpoint on these topics, and we will use feedback on these types of responses to train Gemini to better address them. Persona Gemini might at times generate responses that seem to suggest it has opinions or emotions, like love or sadness, since it has trained on language that people use to reflect the human experience.

Gemini can sometimes misinterpret these guidelines, producing \u201cfalse positives\u201d and \u201cfalse negatives.\u201d In a \u201cfalse positive,\u201d Gemini might not provide a response to a reasonable prompt, misinterpreting the prompt as inappropriate; and in a \u201cfalse negative,\u201d Gemini might generate an inappropriate response, despite the guidelines in place. Sometimes, the occurrence of false positives or false negatives may give the impression that Gemini is biased: For example, a false positive might cause Gemini to not respond to a question about one side of an issue, while it will respond to the same question about the other side.

However, they assessed the possibility of detection of SARS-CoV-2 from saliva specimen in just one confirmed case [17]. The results of this study showed that the viral load in saliva specimen of patient was 5.9 \u00d7 106 copies per ml and 3.3 \u00d7 106 in pooled nasopharyngeal and throat swab. In another study, 12 patient with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens) were included [9]. The researchers reported that the SARS-CoV-2 was detected in saliva specimens of 11 patients (91.7%) in this trial. The median viral load of these 11 patients was 3.3 \u00d7 106 copies per ml. It is interesting that among these SARS-CoV-2 positive cases, viral cultures were positive for three patients. Later in another article, this research team published the complementary results of their cohort study. In this paper they reported the results of investigation among 23 COVID-19 patients. The results were in accordance with the previous study and showed that the SARS-CoV-2 was detected in saliva specimens of 87% of included subjects [20].\n \n\n Based on the results of included studies, three of them were performed among the Chinese participants. One of these studies included 65 cases and the other one recruited 31 confirmed COVID-19 patients [18, 19]. The results of the first project showed that the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 based on sputum (95.65%) and saliva (88.09%) specimens were significantly higher than throat or nasal swabs (P < 0.001, 20). The authors also reported no significant difference between sputum and saliva samples regarding viral load (P < 0.05).\n \n\n The study from Chen et al. showed that among the 13 patients whose oropharyngeal swab tests were positive, 4 cases were also positive for their saliva specimens [19]. The latest study among the Chinese patients, reported the results based on a total of 1846 respiratory samples (1178 saliva and 668 sputum specimens) from 96 confirmed cases [22]. The authors reported that the SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all 96 patients by testing respiratory samples [22].\n \n\n The other two studies conducted in Australia and Italy among confirmed COVID-19 patients. These studies reported a detection rate of 84.6 and 100% respectively, based on saliva specimens [21, 24]. One of the included studies in this review is a case-report regarding a confirmed SARS-CoV-2 neonate [23]. In this case, the SARS-CoV-2 was detected in all of the neonate\u2019s clinical specimens, including blood, urine, stool, and saliva along with the upper respiratory tract specimens.\n \n\n Discussion\n One of the main concerns regarding epidemic prevention and control of any infectious disease is rapid and accurate screening of suspected patients. Apart from the level of sensitivity and specificity of laboratory techniques, selecting the appropriate sites to collect samples is very important. Selection of proper sampling method should be based on the tissue affinity of targeted virus, cost-effectiveness of method and also safety of patients and clinicians [18, 25]. In this study we classified the current evidence regarding the reliability of saliva as a diagnostic specimen in COVID-19 patients.\n \n\n Most of the studies included in this review, reported that there is no statistically significant difference between nasopharyngeal or sputum specimens and saliva samples regarding viral load. These studies suggested saliva as a non-invasive specimen type for the diagnosis and viral load monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 [9, 17, 18, 20,21,22, 24]. Previous studies also reported a high overall agreement between saliva and nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens when tested by an automated multiplex molecular assay approved for point-of-care testing [12, 26, 27].\n \n\n Based on these studies, the method of collection of saliva and collection device types are critical issues in the way of using saliva as diagnostic specimen. In this regard there are three main types of human saliva (whole saliva, parotid gland and minor gland) and the method of collection of each type varies accordingly [26]. When the aim of sampling is detecting the respiratory viruses with molecular assays, collecting the whole saliva from the suspected patients is useful [26]. In this regard the patients should be instructed to expectorate saliva into a sterile container. The volume of saliva should be ranged between 0.5 and 1 ml. Then 2 ml of viral transport medium (VTM) should be added to the container [11]. The next procedures will be conducted based on instructions of related RT-PCR technique in the microbiology laboratory.\n \n\n The low concordance rate of saliva with nasopharyngeal specimens reported in the research of Chen et al. might be explained by the differences in the method of obtaining the samples [19]. This study reported the detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 in pure saliva fluid secreted from the opening of salivary gland canals. However in other studies patients were asked to cough out saliva from their throat into sterile containers, and hence the saliva samples were mainly sputum from the lower respiratory tract [9, 17, 18]. Thus for increasing the sensitivity of salivary tests in the way of diagnosing the suspected COVID-19 patients, the instructions should clearly explain the correct procedure to the individuals.\n \n\n The use of saliva samples for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 has many advantages in clinical practice. First, collecting saliva is a non-invasive procedure and rather than nasal or throat swabs avoids patient discomfort. The second advantage of using saliva as specimen is related to possibility of collecting samples outside the hospitals. This sampling method doesn\u2019t require the intervention of healthcare personnel and the suspected patients can provide it by themselves. Therefore this method can decrease the risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission.\n \n\n Furthermore, because there is not necessary for presence of trained healthcare workers for collecting saliva specimen, the waiting time for suspected patients will be reduced. This is crucial in busy clinical settings where a large number of individuals require screening.\n \n\n The results of viral culture in one of the included studies showed that saliva collected from COVID-19 patients, may contain live viruses which may allow transmission of virus from person to person [9]. These finding reinforce the use of barrier-protection equipment as a control measure, for all healthcare workers in the clinic/hospital settings during the epidemic period of COVID-19.\n \n\n It should be mentioned that this study has several limitations. Firstly, the outbreak and detection of SARS-CoV-2 has begun very recently; therefore the available data in this regard is very scarce. Secondly the included studies of this review didn\u2019t evaluate other factors such as severity of disease or disease progression that may impact on detection rate of the virus. Finally as all of the selected studies only included hospitalized confirmed COVID-19 patients, further studies should be performed in outpatient settings.\n \n\n Conclusions\n In conclusion, although further research is warranted as the weight of the evidence increases, saliva can be considered as a non-invasive specimen for screening SARS-CoV-2 suspected patients.

Which type of arbitrage would be most suitable for a retail investors with a moderate amount of capital?", "context_document": "2. Merger Arbitrage\n Merger arbitrage is an investing strategy that capitalizes on the difference in price between the target company\u2019s stock price and the price offered by the acquirer in a merger or acquirement. \n \n\n The differences between merger arbitrage and other types of arbitrage lie in the potential risks and rewards associated with the transaction. Merger arbitrage is less risky than other forms of arbitrage due to the long-term nature of the transaction and the ability to hedge some of the risks associated with the acquisition.\n \n\n Merger arbitrage provides a high potential return with relatively low risk. It is also a relatively low-cost strategy and does not require the trader to take on a large amount of leverage.\n \n\n Pros of merger arbitrage include the fact that investors capitalizes on the difference in price between the target company\u2019s stock price and the price offered by the acquirer, as well as the potential for a high return on investment.\n \n\n Cons of merger arbitrage include the fact that there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the transaction and the potential for the deal to fall through. This leads to a loss of capital for the investor.\n \n\n An example of merger arbitrage is if a company announces a merger with another company, and the target company\u2019s stock price jumps above the price offered by the acquirer. An investor could purchase stock in the target company and hold it until the acquisition was completed, thereby capitalizing on the price difference.\n \n\n 3. Convertible Arbitrage\n Convertible arbitrage is an investment strategy where an investor will purchase a convertible bond and simultaneously sell short the stock into which the convertible are converted. Convertible arbitrage\u2019s idea is that the investor profits from a discrepancy in the convertible arbitrage spread.\n \n\n Convertible arbitrage\u2019s biggest advantage is that it offers investors an opportunity for additional profits and helps reduce market risk by diversifying across different asset classes. Convertible arbitrage strategies have historically experienced lower volatility than traditional equity strategies.\n \n\n The main disadvantage of convertible arbitrage is that it involves riskier activities than traditional arbitrage. It involves taking on the stock and the convertible bond risk. The liquidity risk of the underlying securities could be quite high.\n \n\n 4. Risk Arbitrage\n Risk arbitrage is an investment strategy that seeks to take advantage of price discrepancies between related securities, often caused by corporate events such as mergers, restructurings, and takeover bids. Risk arbitrage involves buying the undervalued security and selling the overvalued security, with the expectation that the prices will converge as the corporate events unfold. \n \n\n The main difference between risk arbitrage and other forms of arbitrage is that it involves taking a short-term risk, as there is a possibility that the arbitrageur will not be able to close out the positions prior to the prices converging. This could either result in a loss or a gain, depending on the direction and magnitude of the price movements.\n \n\n The main advantage of risk arbitrage is the potential to earn high returns in a short period of time. Arbitrageurs are able to take advantage of price discrepancies that exist in the market, and if the prices converge as expected, large profits are realized. \n \n\n The main disadvantage of risk arbitrage is that it involves taking a short-term risk. The arbitrageur could incur losses if the prices do not move in the expected direction or magnitude, In addition, risk arbitrage is time-sensitive, and the arbitrageur needs to be able to close out the positions prior to the prices converging in order to take advantage of the mispricing.\n \n\n An example of risk arbitrage is the acquisition of a company by another company. If the market prices of the target company are lower than the offer price, the arbitrageur buy shares of the target company and short-sells shares of the acquiring company. If the market prices of the target company converge to the offer price, the arbitrageur closes out the positions and earns a profit.\n \n\n 5. Dividend Arbitrage\n Dividend arbitrage is a form of arbitrage that involves taking advantage of the difference in share prices before and after the ex-dividend date. The dividend arbitrage strategy involves buying the stock before the ex-dividend date and then selling it on the same day at a higher price. This allows investors to capitalize on the difference in share prices without directly engaging in the stock market.\n \n\n The difference between dividend arbitrage and other forms of arbitrage is that, in the case of dividend arbitrage, investors are taking advantage of the difference in share prices before and after the ex-dividend date. Other forms of arbitrage involve taking advantage of pricing discrepancies in different markets. \n \n\n The main advantage of dividend arbitrage is that it allows investors to capitalize on the difference in share prices without directly engaging in the stock market. This benefits investors who need more time or resources to actively trade in the stock market. \n \n\n The main disadvantage of dividend arbitrage is that it requires investors to buy the stock before the ex-dividend date. This means that there is a risk that the stock price could fall significantly before the ex-dividend date, resulting in a loss for the investor.\n \n\n For example, if an investor buys a stock for Rs. 50 per share before the ex-dividend date and sells it for Rs. 55 per share on the same day, the investor will make a profit of Rs. 5 per share. This profit is made without having to actively engage in the stock market.\n \n\n 6. Futures Arbitrage\n Futures Arbitrage is a strategy that involves taking advantage of discrepancies in pricing between two different markets for a fututes instrument. Futures arbitrage involves buying the futures in one market at a lower price and selling it in another at a higher price, thus making a profit. \n \n\n The main difference between Futures Arbitrage and other arbitrage strategies is that Futures Arbitrage involves taking advantage of discrepancies in the prices of futures contracts. Other arbitrage strategies involve taking advantage of discrepancies between two or more different types of securities.\n \n\n Pros of Futures Arbitrage include the potential for high returns in a relatively short period and the ability to capitalize on discrepancies in market prices without possessing the underlying instrument.\n \n\n Cons of Futures Arbitrage include the high risk associated with this strategy and the fact that it requires a good understanding of the markets and the instruments being traded.\n \n\n An example of Futures Arbitrage would be buying a gold futures contract in the US and selling the same contract in India at a higher price, thus making a profit.\n \n\n 7. Pure Arbitrage\n Pure arbitrage is taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets to make a risk-free profit. Pure arbitrage involves simultaneously buying and selling the same financial asset, commodity, or currency in different markets to take advantage of the price difference.\n \n\n The main advantage of pure arbitrage is that it is a low-risk strategy. Since the investor is simultaneously buying and selling the same asset, at least one of their orders is guaranteed to be profitable.\n \n\n The main disadvantage of pure arbitrage is that it is a complex and time-consuming process. It requires access to multiple markets and acting quickly to take advantage of the price discrepancies before they disappear.\n \n\n For example, an investor notices that gold prices are higher in New York than in London. The investor buys gold in London and then simultaneously sells it in New York to take advantage of the price discrepancy and make a risk-free profit.", "full_prompt": "<TASK DESCRIPTION>\n Only use the provided text to answer the question, no outside sources.\n \n\n <QUESTION>\n Compare the main types of financial arbitrage, and compare their advantages and disadvantages.

Respond in under 100 words.", "context_document": "Chapter 3: Remuneration of IMA Work\nQuestion 1: Do you agree with our proposal to pay higher fees for IMB Work? \nPlease state yes/no/maybe and provide reasons.\nQuestion 2: We are evaluating the possibility of increasing fees for IMB Work by \nup to 15% compared to the current immigration legal aid fees. Within the range of \nup to 15%, what percentage increase do you believe would be appropriate?\nConsultation summary\n31. In total there were 38 responses to both Question 1 and Question 2. Of the 38 \nresponses to Question 1, 17 agreed with the proposal to pay higher fees for IMA \nwork (45%), 11 disagreed with the proposal (29%) and 10 responded with \u2018maybe\u2019 \n(26%). Of these, 34 respondents went on to provide reasons for their answer. \n32. Most respondents agreed with the Government\u2019s proposal to pay higher fees for IMA \nWork but disagreed with the \u2018up to 15%\u2019 fee level and the focus on IMA Work. Upon \nanalysis, the overall sentiment of responses was negative (36 respondents, 95%). Of \nthe remaining responses (two respondents, 5%), one gave a neutral response and \nanother respondent gave a positive response \u2013 however no additional comments \nwere given.\n33. There were many reasons given for why respondents either disagreed with the \nproposal or agreed with the proposal overall but had a negative sentiment. These\nhave been summarised below. \nFee level\n34. Most respondents agreed with the Government\u2019s proposal to pay higher fees for IMA \nWork but disagreed with the \u2018up to 15%\u2019 fee level, with only two respondents (5%)\nagreeing with the \u2018up to\u2019 15% rise. A reason given by one of these respondents was \nthat \u2018lawyers/barristers do very hard important work and should be paid more to \nreflect huge responsibility that comes with doing [IMA] work\u2019. \n35. There were varying views about what fee level should be required, but over half of\nrespondents stated that 15% is either insufficient or inappropriate, should be the \nminimum increase and/or that the fee level should be higher than 15%. Many \nLegal Aid Fees in the Illegal Migration Act:\nThe Government\u2019s response to the consultation on fees in relation to the Illegal Migration Act\n12\nrespondents did not provide an alternative rate, but of those that did, increases \nranged from 50% to 150% \u2013 these included that fees should be:\n\u2022 50% (six respondents);\n\u2022 raised in line with inflation (three respondents);\n\u2022 50% for regular work carried out under the IMA; but raised to 100% for any work \nthat progresses to the High Court or beyond (three respondents); and\n\u2022 100\u2013150%: reflective of inflation, and the lack of increases and subsequent cuts \nto fees over the years (three respondents).\n36. Of those who said 15% was insufficient or inappropriate, or that a higher rate should \nbe pursued, there were a multitude of reasons that formed the basis of this response. \nFor example, respondents stated that 15% would not incentivise capacity and that \nincreasing legal aid fees by \u2018up to 15%\u2019 was insufficient to reflect increased caseload, \nand its subsequent impact on capacity within an already \u2018overstretched\u2019 sector. Views \nwere also raised that the proposed increase would not be sufficient to \u2018address the \nchallenges the consultation identified\u2019, especially considering the short timeframe for \nmaking a suspensive claim (eight days). Another view was raised by respondents \naround the expected complexity of the work.\n37. Respondents also stated that 15% higher fees for IMA Work was insufficient because\nlegal aid rates have not increased, nor been augmented in line with inflation, since \n1996 and furthermore were cut by 10% in 2011. One provider noted that 15% \u2018does \nlittle more than address inflationary increases in costs that providers have had to \nabsorb over the last two years\u2019. Some also noted the depreciation of legal aid fees \nover time. Respondents also remarked on a difference in levels of legal aid capacity \nacross different areas of the UK as an increasing challenge.\n38. However, two respondents stated that an increase less than 15% should be pursued.\nOne stated that it should be 0% as the Government should move to \u2018fixed competitive \nfees\u2019 acquired by chambers bidding. The other stated it should be 3% on the basis \nthat legal aid should be a fixed amount no matter the demand.\nScope of fee proposal\n39. Some respondents suggested that the proposal should not be restricted to work done \nunder the IMA. Eight respondents said that the fee increase should be expanded to \nall immigration legal aid (21%), two suggested that it should be expanded to all civil \nlegal aid (5%), and one suggested it should be expanded to all legal aid (3%). Three \nother respondents raised the restrictive nature of the proposal but did not provide \nfurther detail. \nLegal Aid Fees in the Illegal Migration Act:\nThe Government\u2019s response to the consultation on fees in relation to the Illegal Migration Act\n13\n40. Views included that a raise in fees for IMA Work only could \u2018encourage a shift to this \nwork by providers, away from other essential work that needs to be done\u2019 and could \nlead to \u2018perverse\u2019 incentives to undertake this work, to the detriment of other\nimmigration work.\nAdditional measures\n41. Across Questions 1 and 2, respondents stated that additional measures would be \nrequired to improve the effectiveness of the 15% increase. The further measures \nmentioned included: accreditation, interpreter fees and disbursements. Some also \nstated that additional measures were needed but did not specify further. Those\nresponses have been summarised in Chapter 4. \nWider stakeholder feedback\n42. At the stakeholder engagement events, on costs and fees many stakeholders noted \nthat the fees uplift should be expanded beyond IMA Work. They also shared the view \nthat limiting the uplift to IMA Work could risk shifting capacity away from other policy \npriority areas and aggravate access to legal aid for other migrants.

Within the range of \nup to 15%, what percentage increase do you believe would be appropriate?\nConsultation summary\n31. In total there were 38 responses to both Question 1 and Question 2. Of the 38 \nresponses to Question 1, 17 agreed with the proposal to pay higher fees for IMA \nwork (45%), 11 disagreed with the proposal (29%) and 10 responded with \u2018maybe\u2019 \n(26%). Of these, 34 respondents went on to provide reasons for their answer. \n32. Most respondents agreed with the Government\u2019s proposal to pay higher fees for IMA \nWork but disagreed with the \u2018up to 15%\u2019 fee level and the focus on IMA Work. Upon \nanalysis, the overall sentiment of responses was negative (36 respondents, 95%). Of \nthe remaining responses (two respondents, 5%), one gave a neutral response and \nanother respondent gave a positive response \u2013 however no additional comments \nwere given.\n33. There were many reasons given for why respondents either disagreed with the \nproposal or agreed with the proposal overall but had a negative sentiment. These\nhave been summarised below. \nFee level\n34. Most respondents agreed with the Government\u2019s proposal to pay higher fees for IMA \nWork but disagreed with the \u2018up to 15%\u2019 fee level, with only two respondents (5%)\nagreeing with the \u2018up to\u2019 15% rise. A reason given by one of these respondents was \nthat \u2018lawyers/barristers do very hard important work and should be paid more to \nreflect huge responsibility that comes with doing [IMA] work\u2019. \n35. There were varying views about what fee level should be required, but over half of\nrespondents stated that 15% is either insufficient or inappropriate, should be the \nminimum increase and/or that the fee level should be higher than 15%. Many \nLegal Aid Fees in the Illegal Migration Act:\nThe Government\u2019s response to the consultation on fees in relation to the Illegal Migration Act\n12\nrespondents did not provide an alternative rate, but of those that did, increases \nranged from 50% to 150% \u2013 these included that fees should be:\n\u2022 50% (six respondents);\n\u2022 raised in line with inflation (three respondents);\n\u2022 50% for regular work carried out under the IMA; but raised to 100% for any work \nthat progresses to the High Court or beyond (three respondents); and\n\u2022 100\u2013150%: reflective of inflation, and the lack of increases and subsequent cuts \nto fees over the years (three respondents).\n36. Of those who said 15% was insufficient or inappropriate, or that a higher rate should \nbe pursued, there were a multitude of reasons that formed the basis of this response. \nFor example, respondents stated that 15% would not incentivise capacity and that \nincreasing legal aid fees by \u2018up to 15%\u2019 was insufficient to reflect increased caseload, \nand its subsequent impact on capacity within an already \u2018overstretched\u2019 sector. Views \nwere also raised that the proposed increase would not be sufficient to \u2018address the \nchallenges the consultation identified\u2019, especially considering the short timeframe for \nmaking a suspensive claim (eight days). Another view was raised by respondents \naround the expected complexity of the work.\n37. Respondents also stated that 15% higher fees for IMA Work was insufficient because\nlegal aid rates have not increased, nor been augmented in line with inflation, since \n1996 and furthermore were cut by 10% in 2011. One provider noted that 15% \u2018does \nlittle more than address inflationary increases in costs that providers have had to \nabsorb over the last two years\u2019. Some also noted the depreciation of legal aid fees \nover time. Respondents also remarked on a difference in levels of legal aid capacity \nacross different areas of the UK as an increasing challenge.\n38. However, two respondents stated that an increase less than 15% should be pursued.\nOne stated that it should be 0% as the Government should move to \u2018fixed competitive \nfees\u2019 acquired by chambers bidding. The other stated it should be 3% on the basis \nthat legal aid should be a fixed amount no matter the demand.\nScope of fee proposal\n39. Some respondents suggested that the proposal should not be restricted to work done \nunder the IMA. Eight respondents said that the fee increase should be expanded to \nall immigration legal aid (21%), two suggested that it should be expanded to all civil \nlegal aid (5%), and one suggested it should be expanded to all legal aid (3%). Three \nother respondents raised the restrictive nature of the proposal but did not provide \nfurther detail. \nLegal Aid Fees in the Illegal Migration Act:\nThe Government\u2019s response to the consultation on fees in relation to the Illegal Migration Act\n13\n40. Views included that a raise in fees for IMA Work only could \u2018encourage a shift to this \nwork by providers, away from other essential work that needs to be done\u2019 and could \nlead to \u2018perverse\u2019 incentives to undertake this work, to the detriment of other\nimmigration work.\nAdditional measures\n41. Across Questions 1 and 2, respondents stated that additional measures would be \nrequired to improve the effectiveness of the 15% increase. The further measures \nmentioned included: accreditation, interpreter fees and disbursements. Some also \nstated that additional measures were needed but did not specify further. Those\nresponses have been summarised in Chapter 4. \nWider stakeholder feedback\n42. At the stakeholder engagement events, on costs and fees many stakeholders noted \nthat the fees uplift should be expanded beyond IMA Work. They also shared the view \nthat limiting the uplift to IMA Work could risk shifting capacity away from other policy \npriority areas and aggravate access to legal aid for other migrants. Several \nstakeholders also noted that the 15% uplift is not high enough to increase capacity \nand suggested increasing fees in line with inflation (which amounts to a 100% uplift.)\nOther proposals included paying between \u00a3150\u2013250 per hour as the adequate \ncompensation level that could incentivise providers and help build capacity. \n43.

This could also result in tax consequences and unintended dissolution, among other complications. \n \n\n Consulting with business counselors, attorneys, and accountants can prove helpful.\n \n\n Review common business structures\n Sole proprietorship\n A sole proprietorship is easy to form and gives you complete control of your business. You're automatically considered to be a sole proprietorship if you do business activities but don't register as any other kind of business. \n \n\n Sole proprietorships do not produce a separate business entity. This means your business assets and liabilities are not separate from your personal assets and liabilities. You can be held personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business. Sole proprietors are still able to get a trade name. It can also be hard to raise money because you can't sell stock, and banks are hesitant to lend to sole proprietorships.\n \n\n Sole proprietorships can be a good choice for low-risk businesses and owners who want to test their business idea before forming a more formal business.\n \n\n Partnership\n Partnerships are the simplest structure for two or more people to own a business together. There are two common kinds of partnerships: limited partnerships (LP) and limited liability partnerships (LLP).\n \n\n Limited partnerships have only one general partner with unlimited liability, and all other partners have limited liability. The partners with limited liability also tend to have limited control over the company, which is documented in a partnership agreement. Profits are passed through to personal tax returns, and the general partner \u2014 the partner without limited liability \u2014 must also pay self-employment taxes.\n \n\n Limited liability partnerships are similar to limited partnerships, but give limited liability to every owner. An LLP protects each partner from debts against the partnership, they won't be responsible for the actions of other partners. \n \n\n Partnerships can be a good choice for businesses with multiple owners, professional groups (like attorneys), and groups who want to test their business idea before forming a more formal business.\n \n\n Limited liability company (LLC) \n An LLC lets you take advantage of the benefits of both the corporation and partnership business structures.\n \n\n LLCs protect you from personal liability in most instances, your personal assets \u2014 like your vehicle, house, and savings accounts \u2014 won't be at risk in case your LLC faces bankruptcy or lawsuits.\n Profits and losses can get passed through to your personal income without facing corporate taxes. However, members of an LLC are considered self-employed and must pay self-employment tax contributions towards Medicare and Social Security.\n \n\n LLCs can have a limited life in many states. When a member joins or leaves an LLC, some states may require the LLC to be dissolved and re-formed with new membership \u2014 unless there's already an agreement in place within the LLC for buying, selling, and transferring ownership.\n \n\n LLCs can be a good choice for medium- or higher-risk businesses, owners with significant personal assets they want protected, and owners who want to pay a lower tax rate than they would with a corporation.\n \n\n Corporation\n C corp\n A corporation, sometimes called a C corp, is a legal entity that's separate from its owners. Corporations can make a profit, be taxed, and can be held legally liable.\n \n\n Corporations offer the strongest protection to its owners from personal liability, but the cost to form a corporation is higher than other structures. Corporations also require more extensive record-keeping, operational processes, and reporting.\n \n\n Unlike sole proprietors, partnerships, and LLCs, corporations pay income tax on their profits. In some cases, corporate profits are taxed twice \u2014 first, when the company makes a profit, and again when dividends are paid to shareholders on their personal tax returns.\n \n\n Corporations have a completely independent life separate from its shareholders. If a shareholder leaves the company or sells his or her shares, the C corp can continue doing business relatively undisturbed.\n \n\n Corporations have an advantage when it comes to raising capital because they can raise funds through the sale of stock, which can also be a benefit in attracting employees.\n \n\n Corporations can be a good choice for medium- or higher-risk businesses, those that need to raise money, and businesses that plan to \"go public\" or eventually be sold.\n \n\n S corp\n An S corporation, sometimes called an S corp, is a special type of corporation that's designed to avoid the double taxation drawback of regular C corps. S corps allow profits, and some losses, to be passed through directly to owners' personal income without ever being subject to corporate tax rates.\n \n\n Not all states tax S corps equally, but most recognize them the same way the federal government does and tax the shareholders accordingly. Some states tax S corps on profits above a specified limit and other states don't recognize the S corp election at all, simply treating the business as a C corp.\n \n\n S corps must file with the IRS to get S corp status, a different process from registering with their state.\n \n\n There are special limits on S corps. Check the IRS website for eligibility requirements(Link is external). You'll still have to follow the strict filing and operational processes of a C corp.\n \n\n S corps also have an independent life, just like C corps. If a shareholder leaves the company or sells his or her shares, the S corp can continue doing business relatively undisturbed.\n \n\n S corps can be a good choice for a businesses that would otherwise be a C corp, but meet the criteria to file as an S corp\n \n\n \n\n Compare business structures\n Compare the general traits of these business structures, but remember that ownership rules, liability, taxes, and filing requirements for each business structure can vary by state.

There are two common kinds of partnerships: limited partnerships (LP) and limited liability partnerships (LLP).\n \n\n Limited partnerships have only one general partner with unlimited liability, and all other partners have limited liability. The partners with limited liability also tend to have limited control over the company, which is documented in a partnership agreement. Profits are passed through to personal tax returns, and the general partner \u2014 the partner without limited liability \u2014 must also pay self-employment taxes.\n \n\n Limited liability partnerships are similar to limited partnerships, but give limited liability to every owner. An LLP protects each partner from debts against the partnership, they won't be responsible for the actions of other partners. \n \n\n Partnerships can be a good choice for businesses with multiple owners, professional groups (like attorneys), and groups who want to test their business idea before forming a more formal business.\n \n\n Limited liability company (LLC) \n An LLC lets you take advantage of the benefits of both the corporation and partnership business structures.\n \n\n LLCs protect you from personal liability in most instances, your personal assets \u2014 like your vehicle, house, and savings accounts \u2014 won't be at risk in case your LLC faces bankruptcy or lawsuits.\n Profits and losses can get passed through to your personal income without facing corporate taxes. However, members of an LLC are considered self-employed and must pay self-employment tax contributions towards Medicare and Social Security.\n \n\n LLCs can have a limited life in many states. When a member joins or leaves an LLC, some states may require the LLC to be dissolved and re-formed with new membership \u2014 unless there's already an agreement in place within the LLC for buying, selling, and transferring ownership.\n \n\n LLCs can be a good choice for medium- or higher-risk businesses, owners with significant personal assets they want protected, and owners who want to pay a lower tax rate than they would with a corporation.\n \n\n Corporation\n C corp\n A corporation, sometimes called a C corp, is a legal entity that's separate from its owners. Corporations can make a profit, be taxed, and can be held legally liable.\n \n\n Corporations offer the strongest protection to its owners from personal liability, but the cost to form a corporation is higher than other structures. Corporations also require more extensive record-keeping, operational processes, and reporting.\n \n\n Unlike sole proprietors, partnerships, and LLCs, corporations pay income tax on their profits. In some cases, corporate profits are taxed twice \u2014 first, when the company makes a profit, and again when dividends are paid to shareholders on their personal tax returns.\n \n\n Corporations have a completely independent life separate from its shareholders. If a shareholder leaves the company or sells his or her shares, the C corp can continue doing business relatively undisturbed.\n \n\n Corporations have an advantage when it comes to raising capital because they can raise funds through the sale of stock, which can also be a benefit in attracting employees.\n \n\n Corporations can be a good choice for medium- or higher-risk businesses, those that need to raise money, and businesses that plan to \"go public\" or eventually be sold.\n \n\n S corp\n An S corporation, sometimes called an S corp, is a special type of corporation that's designed to avoid the double taxation drawback of regular C corps. S corps allow profits, and some losses, to be passed through directly to owners' personal income without ever being subject to corporate tax rates.\n \n\n Not all states tax S corps equally, but most recognize them the same way the federal government does and tax the shareholders accordingly. Some states tax S corps on profits above a specified limit and other states don't recognize the S corp election at all, simply treating the business as a C corp.\n \n\n S corps must file with the IRS to get S corp status, a different process from registering with their state.\n \n\n There are special limits on S corps. Check the IRS website for eligibility requirements(Link is external). You'll still have to follow the strict filing and operational processes of a C corp.\n \n\n S corps also have an independent life, just like C corps. If a shareholder leaves the company or sells his or her shares, the S corp can continue doing business relatively undisturbed.\n \n\n S corps can be a good choice for a businesses that would otherwise be a C corp, but meet the criteria to file as an S corp\n \n\n \n\n Compare business structures\n Compare the general traits of these business structures, but remember that ownership rules, liability, taxes, and filing requirements for each business structure can vary by state.

This Court\u2019s history shows, however, that stare decisis is not absolute, and indeed cannot be absolute.\nOtherwise, as the Court today explains, many long-sinceoverruled cases such as Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537\n(1896); Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905); Minersville School Dist. v. Gobitis, 310 U. S. 586 (1940); and Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986), would never have\nbeen overruled and would still be the law.\nIn his canonical Burnet opinion in 1932, Justice Brandeis\nstated that in \u201ccases involving the Federal Constitution,\nwhere correction through legislative action is practically\nimpossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions.\u201d Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393,\n406\u2212407 (1932) (dissenting opinion). That description of\nthe Court\u2019s practice remains accurate today. Every current\nMember of this Court has voted to overrule precedent. And\nover the last 100 years beginning with Chief Justice Taft\u2019s\nappointment in 1921, every one of the 48 Justices appointed\nto this Court has voted to overrule precedent. Many of\nthose Justices have voted to overrule a substantial number\nof very significant and longstanding precedents. See, e.g.,\nObergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015) (overruling Baker\nv. Nelson); Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483\n(1954) (overruling Plessy v. Ferguson); West Coast Hotel Co.\nv. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937) (overruling Adkins v. Children\u2019s Hospital of D. C. and in effect Lochner v. New York).\nBut that history alone does not answer the critical question: When precisely should the Court overrule an erroneous constitutional precedent? The history of stare decisis in\n\n\nCite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 7\nKAVANAUGH, J., concurring\nthis Court establishes that a constitutional precedent may\nbe overruled only when (i) the prior decision is not just\nwrong, but is egregiously wrong, (ii) the prior decision has\ncaused significant negative jurisprudential or real-world\nconsequences, and (iii) overruling the prior decision would\nnot unduly upset legitimate reliance interests. See Ramos\nv. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___\u2212___ (2020) (KAVANAUGH, J.,\nconcurring in part) (slip op., at 7\u22128).\nApplying those factors, I agree with the Court today that\nRoe should be overruled. The Court in Roe erroneously assigned itself the authority to decide a critically important\nmoral and policy issue that the Constitution does not grant\nthis Court the authority to decide. As Justice Byron White\nsuccinctly explained, Roe was \u201can improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review\u201d because\n\u201cnothing in the language or history of the Constitution\u201d supports a constitutional right to abortion. Bolton, 410 U. S.,\nat 221\u2212222 (dissenting opinion).\nOf course, the fact that a precedent is wrong, even egregiously wrong, does not alone mean that the precedent\nshould be overruled. But as the Court today explains, Roe\nhas caused significant negative jurisprudential and realworld consequences. By taking sides on a difficult and contentious issue on which the Constitution is neutral, Roe\noverreached and exceeded this Court\u2019s constitutional authority; gravely distorted the Nation\u2019s understanding of\nthis Court\u2019s proper constitutional role; and caused significant harm to what Roe itself recognized as the State\u2019s \u201cimportant and legitimate interest\u201d in protecting fetal life. 410\nU. S., at 162. All of that explains why tens of millions of\nAmericans\u2014and the 26 States that explicitly ask the Court\nto overrule Roe\u2014do not accept Roe even 49 years later.\nUnder the Court\u2019s longstanding stare decisis principles, Roe\n\n\n\n8 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nKAVANAUGH, J., concurring\nshould be overruled.3\n But the stare decisis analysis here is somewhat more\ncomplicated because of Casey. In 1992, 19 years after Roe,\nCasey acknowledged the continuing dispute over Roe. The\nCourt sought to find common ground that would resolve the\nabortion debate and end the national controversy. After\ncareful and thoughtful consideration, the Casey plurality\nreaffirmed a right to abortion through viability (about 24\nweeks), while also allowing somewhat more regulation of\nabortion than Roe had allowed.4\nI have deep and unyielding respect for the Justices who\nwrote the Casey plurality opinion. And I respect the Casey\nplurality\u2019s good-faith effort to locate some middle ground or\ncompromise that could resolve this controversy for America.\nBut as has become increasingly evident over time, Casey\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 3 I also agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion today with respect to reliance.\nBroad notions of societal reliance have been invoked in support of Roe,\nbut the Court has not analyzed reliance in that way in the past. For\nexample, American businesses and workers relied on Lochner v. New\nYork, 198 U. S. 45 (1905), and Adkins v. Children\u2019s Hospital of D. C., 261\nU. S. 525 (1923), to construct a laissez-faire economy that was free of\nsubstantial regulation. In West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379\n(1937), the Court nonetheless overruled Adkins and in effect Lochner.\nAn entire region of the country relied on Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S.\n537 (1896), to enforce a system of racial segregation. In Brown v. Board\nof Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), the Court overruled Plessy. Much of\nAmerican society was built around the traditional view of marriage that\nwas upheld in Baker v. Nelson, 409 U. S. 810 (1972), and that was reflected in laws ranging from tax laws to estate laws to family laws. In\nObergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015), the Court nonetheless overruled Baker. 4As the Court today notes, Casey\u2019s approach to stare decisis pointed in\ntwo directions. Casey reaffirmed Roe\u2019s viability line, but it expressly\noverruled the Roe trimester framework and also expressly overruled two\nlandmark post-Roe abortion cases\u2014Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416 (1983), and Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747 (1986). See Casey,\n505 U. S., at 870, 872\u2212873, 878\u2212879, 882. Casey itself thus directly contradicts any notion of absolute stare decisis in abortion cases.\nCite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 9\nKAVANAUGH, J., concurring\nwell-intentioned effort did not resolve the abortion debate.\nThe national division has not ended. In recent years, a significant number of States have enacted abortion restrictions that directly conflict with Roe. Those laws cannot\nbe dismissed as political stunts or as outlier laws. Those\nnumerous state laws collectively represent the sincere and\ndeeply held views of tens of millions of Americans who continue to fervently believe that allowing abortions up to 24\nweeks is far too radical and far too extreme, and does not\nsufficiently account for what Roe itself recognized as the\nState\u2019s \u201cimportant and legitimate interest\u201d in protecting fetal life. 410 U. S., at 162. In this case, moreover, a majority\nof the States\u201426 in all\u2014ask the Court to overrule Roe and\nreturn the abortion issue to the States.\n In short, Casey\u2019s stare decisis analysis rested in part on a\npredictive judgment about the future development of state\nlaws and of the people\u2019s views on the abortion issue. But\nthat predictive judgment has not borne out. As the Court\ntoday explains, the experience over the last 30 years conflicts with Casey\u2019s predictive judgment and therefore undermines Casey\u2019s precedential force.5 ", "full_prompt": "System instruction: For this task, you are required to use only the information that is provided in the prompt.

This Court\u2019s history shows, however, that stare decisis is not absolute, and indeed cannot be absolute.\nOtherwise, as the Court today explains, many long-sinceoverruled cases such as Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S. 537\n(1896); Lochner v. New York, 198 U. S. 45 (1905); Minersville School Dist. v. Gobitis, 310 U. S. 586 (1940); and Bowers v. Hardwick, 478 U. S. 186 (1986), would never have\nbeen overruled and would still be the law.\nIn his canonical Burnet opinion in 1932, Justice Brandeis\nstated that in \u201ccases involving the Federal Constitution,\nwhere correction through legislative action is practically\nimpossible, this Court has often overruled its earlier decisions.\u201d Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393,\n406\u2212407 (1932) (dissenting opinion). That description of\nthe Court\u2019s practice remains accurate today. Every current\nMember of this Court has voted to overrule precedent. And\nover the last 100 years beginning with Chief Justice Taft\u2019s\nappointment in 1921, every one of the 48 Justices appointed\nto this Court has voted to overrule precedent. Many of\nthose Justices have voted to overrule a substantial number\nof very significant and longstanding precedents. See, e.g.,\nObergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015) (overruling Baker\nv. Nelson); Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U. S. 483\n(1954) (overruling Plessy v. Ferguson); West Coast Hotel Co.\nv. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379 (1937) (overruling Adkins v. Children\u2019s Hospital of D. C. and in effect Lochner v. New York).\nBut that history alone does not answer the critical question: When precisely should the Court overrule an erroneous constitutional precedent? The history of stare decisis in\n\n\nCite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 7\nKAVANAUGH, J., concurring\nthis Court establishes that a constitutional precedent may\nbe overruled only when (i) the prior decision is not just\nwrong, but is egregiously wrong, (ii) the prior decision has\ncaused significant negative jurisprudential or real-world\nconsequences, and (iii) overruling the prior decision would\nnot unduly upset legitimate reliance interests. See Ramos\nv. Louisiana, 590 U. S. ___, ___\u2212___ (2020) (KAVANAUGH, J.,\nconcurring in part) (slip op., at 7\u22128).\nApplying those factors, I agree with the Court today that\nRoe should be overruled. The Court in Roe erroneously assigned itself the authority to decide a critically important\nmoral and policy issue that the Constitution does not grant\nthis Court the authority to decide. As Justice Byron White\nsuccinctly explained, Roe was \u201can improvident and extravagant exercise of the power of judicial review\u201d because\n\u201cnothing in the language or history of the Constitution\u201d supports a constitutional right to abortion. Bolton, 410 U. S.,\nat 221\u2212222 (dissenting opinion).\nOf course, the fact that a precedent is wrong, even egregiously wrong, does not alone mean that the precedent\nshould be overruled. But as the Court today explains, Roe\nhas caused significant negative jurisprudential and realworld consequences. By taking sides on a difficult and contentious issue on which the Constitution is neutral, Roe\noverreached and exceeded this Court\u2019s constitutional authority; gravely distorted the Nation\u2019s understanding of\nthis Court\u2019s proper constitutional role; and caused significant harm to what Roe itself recognized as the State\u2019s \u201cimportant and legitimate interest\u201d in protecting fetal life. 410\nU. S., at 162. All of that explains why tens of millions of\nAmericans\u2014and the 26 States that explicitly ask the Court\nto overrule Roe\u2014do not accept Roe even 49 years later.\nUnder the Court\u2019s longstanding stare decisis principles, Roe\n\n\n\n8 DOBBS v. JACKSON WOMEN\u2019S HEALTH ORGANIZATION\nKAVANAUGH, J., concurring\nshould be overruled.3\n But the stare decisis analysis here is somewhat more\ncomplicated because of Casey. In 1992, 19 years after Roe,\nCasey acknowledged the continuing dispute over Roe. The\nCourt sought to find common ground that would resolve the\nabortion debate and end the national controversy. After\ncareful and thoughtful consideration, the Casey plurality\nreaffirmed a right to abortion through viability (about 24\nweeks), while also allowing somewhat more regulation of\nabortion than Roe had allowed.4\nI have deep and unyielding respect for the Justices who\nwrote the Casey plurality opinion. And I respect the Casey\nplurality\u2019s good-faith effort to locate some middle ground or\ncompromise that could resolve this controversy for America.\nBut as has become increasingly evident over time, Casey\u2019s\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 3 I also agree with the Court\u2019s conclusion today with respect to reliance.\nBroad notions of societal reliance have been invoked in support of Roe,\nbut the Court has not analyzed reliance in that way in the past. For\nexample, American businesses and workers relied on Lochner v. New\nYork, 198 U. S. 45 (1905), and Adkins v. Children\u2019s Hospital of D. C., 261\nU. S. 525 (1923), to construct a laissez-faire economy that was free of\nsubstantial regulation. In West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish, 300 U. S. 379\n(1937), the Court nonetheless overruled Adkins and in effect Lochner.\nAn entire region of the country relied on Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U. S.\n537 (1896), to enforce a system of racial segregation. In Brown v. Board\nof Education, 347 U. S. 483 (1954), the Court overruled Plessy. Much of\nAmerican society was built around the traditional view of marriage that\nwas upheld in Baker v. Nelson, 409 U. S. 810 (1972), and that was reflected in laws ranging from tax laws to estate laws to family laws. In\nObergefell v. Hodges, 576 U. S. 644 (2015), the Court nonetheless overruled Baker. 4As the Court today notes, Casey\u2019s approach to stare decisis pointed in\ntwo directions. Casey reaffirmed Roe\u2019s viability line, but it expressly\noverruled the Roe trimester framework and also expressly overruled two\nlandmark post-Roe abortion cases\u2014Akron v. Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., 462 U. S. 416 (1983), and Thornburgh v. American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, 476 U. S. 747 (1986). See Casey,\n505 U. S., at 870, 872\u2212873, 878\u2212879, 882. Casey itself thus directly contradicts any notion of absolute stare decisis in abortion cases.\nCite as: 597 U. S. ____ (2022) 9\nKAVANAUGH, J., concurring\nwell-intentioned effort did not resolve the abortion debate.\nThe national division has not ended. In recent years, a significant number of States have enacted abortion restrictions that directly conflict with Roe. Those laws cannot\nbe dismissed as political stunts or as outlier laws. Those\nnumerous state laws collectively represent the sincere and\ndeeply held views of tens of millions of Americans who continue to fervently believe that allowing abortions up to 24\nweeks is far too radical and far too extreme, and does not\nsufficiently account for what Roe itself recognized as the\nState\u2019s \u201cimportant and legitimate interest\u201d in protecting fetal life. 410 U. S., at 162. In this case, moreover, a majority\nof the States\u201426 in all\u2014ask the Court to overrule Roe and\nreturn the abortion issue to the States.\n In short, Casey\u2019s stare decisis analysis rested in part on a\npredictive judgment about the future development of state\nlaws and of the people\u2019s views on the abortion issue. But\nthat predictive judgment has not borne out. As the Court\ntoday explains, the experience over the last 30 years conflicts with Casey\u2019s predictive judgment and therefore undermines Casey\u2019s precedential force.5 "}

The backbones of the long distance telephone network were chains of microwave relay towers, which engineers had planned to replace by buried pipelines carrying millimeter waves in the 60-GHz range, starting in the 1970s. Bell Telephone Laboratories were quick to begin research on optical communications after the invention of the laser, but they spent the 1960s studying beam transmission through buried hollow confocal waveguides, expecting laser communications to be the next generation after the millimeter waveguide, on a technology timetable spanning decades. Corning\u2019s invention of the low-loss fiber in 1970 changed all that. Bell abandoned the hollow optical guide in 1972 and never put any millimeter waveguide into commercial service after completing a field test in the mid-1970s. But telephone engineers remained wary of installing fiber without exhaustive tests and field trials. Bell engineers developed and exhaustively tested the first generation of fiber-optic systems, based on multimode graded-index fibers transmitting 45 Mb/s at 850 nm over spans of 10 km, connecting local telephone central offices. Deployment began slowly in the late 1970s, and soon a second fiber window opened at 1300nm, allowing a doubling of speed and transmission distance. In 1980, AT&T announced plans to extend multimode fiber into its long-haul network, by laying a 144-fiber cable between Boston and Washington with repeaters spaced every 7 km along an existing right of way. Yet by then change was accelerating in the no-longer stodgy telecommunications industry. Two crucial choices in system design and the breakup of AT&T were about to launch the modern fiber-optic communications industry. In 1980, Bell Labs announced that the next generation of transoceanic telephone cables would use single-mode fiber instead of the copper coaxial cables used since the first transatlantic phone cable in 1956. In 1982, the upstart MCI Communications picked single-mode fiber as the backbone of its new North American longdistance phone network, replacing the microwave towers that gave the company its original name, Microwave Communications Inc. That same year, AT&T agreed to divest its seven regional telephone companies to focus on long-distance service, computing, and communications hardware. The submarine fiber decision was a bold bet on a new technology based on desperation. Regulators had barred AT&T from operating communication satellites since the mid-1960s. Coax had reached its practical limit for intercontinental cables. Only single-mode fiber transmitting at 1310 nm could transmit 280 Mb/s through 50-km spans stretching more than 6000 km across the Atlantic. AT&T and its partners British Telecom and France Telecom set a target of 1988 for installing TAT-8, the first transatlantic fiber cable. More submarine fiber cables would follow. In 1982, MCI went looking for new technology to upgrade its long-distance phone network. Visits to British Telecom Research Labs and Japanese equipment makers convinced them that single-mode fiber transmitting 400 Mb/s at 1310 nm was ready for installation. AT&T and Sprint soon followed, with Sprint ads promoting the new fiber technology by claiming that callers could hear a pin drop over it. Fueled by the breakup of AT&T and intense competition for long-distance telephone service, fiber sales boomed as new long-haul networks were installed, then slumped briefly after their completion. The switch to single-mode fiber opened the room to further system improvements. By 1987, terrestrial long-distance backbone systems were carrying 800 Mb/s, and systems able to transmit 1.7 Gb/s were in development. Long-distance traffic increased as competition reduced long-distance rates, and developers pushed for the next transmission milestone of 2.5 Gb/s. Telecommunications was becoming an important part of the laser and optics market, pushing development of products including diode lasers, receivers, and optical connectors. Fiber optics had shifted the telephone industry into overdrive. Two more technological revolutions in their early stages in the late 1980s would soon shift telecommunications to warp speed. One came from the optical world, the fiber amplifier. The other came from telecommunications\u2014the Internet. Even inthe late 1980s, the bulk of telecommunications traffic consisted of telephone conversations. (Cable television networks carried analog signals and were separate from the usual world of telecommunications.) Telephony was a mature industry, with traffic volume growing about 10% a year. Fiber traffic was increasing faster than that because fiber was displacing older technologies including microwave relays and geosynchronous communication satellites. Telecommunications networks also carried some digital data, but the overall volume was small. The ideas that laid the groundwork for the Internet date back to the late 1960s. Universities began installing terminals so students and faculty could access mainframe computers, ARPANET began operations to connect universities, and telephone companies envisioned linking home users to mainframes through telephone wiring. Special terminals were hooked to television screens for early home information services called videotex. But those data services attracted few customers, and data traffic remained limited until the spread of personal computers in the 1980s. The first personal computer modems sent 300 bits/s through phone lines, a number that soon rose to 1200 bits/s. Initially the Internet was limited to academic and government users, so other PC users accessed private networks such as CompuServe and America Online, but private Internet accounts became available by 1990. The World Wide Web was launched in 1991 at the European Center for Nuclear Research (CERN)and initially grew slowly.

By good fortune, the global fiber-optic backbone network was already in place as data traffic started to soar. Construction expenses are a major part of network costs, so multi-fiber cables were laid that in the mid-1980s were thought to be adequate to support many years of normal traffic growth.

SCA is usually the most severe form of SCD.\n \n\n SCD and SCA affect significant numbers of people globally. This article discusses SCA prevalence, risk factors, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment.\n \n\n Sickle cell anemia prevalence\n yacobchuk/Getty Images\n According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source, SCD affects millions of people throughout the world. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute states that SCD affects more than 20 millionTrusted Source individuals worldwide.\n \n\n However, the CDC also states the exact number of people in the United States with SCD is unknown. They estimate that:\n \n\n SCD affects approximately 100,000 people in the United States.\n around 1 out of every 365 Black or African American babies have SCD\n around 1 out of every 16,300 Hispanic American babies have SCD\n There is a lack of current scientific data about how many people have SCA, which is a severe formTrusted Source of SCD. A 2022 review of research stated that more than 312,000Trusted Source children are born with SCA annually. However, the review used older data from 2011 to 2013 to provide this statistic.\n \n\n Sickle cell anemia risk factors\n SCA is a genetic condition that a person has from birthTrusted Source, so people cannot develop it any other way. People refer to the atypical genes that characterize the condition and cause SCA as sickle cell genes.\n \n\n If a person has one sickle cell gene, they have sickle cell trait (SCT). People with SCT typically do not have health problems as a result of the gene. However, they can still pass the sickle cell gene on if they have children.\n \n\n If someone inherits two sickle cell genes, they will have a form of SCD that may include SCA. They inherit one gene from each biological parent. If they have SCA, both their parents must have had SCD, SCT, or SCA.\n \n\n SCD is more common in some ethnic groups, such as:\n \n\n people of African descent\n Hispanic Americans from Central and South America\n people with Middle Eastern heritage\n individuals of Asian descent\n people with Indian heritage\n individuals of Mediterranean descent\n According to the CDC, approximately 1 in 13Trusted Source Black or African American babies have SCT.\n \n\n Learn more about SCA in African Americans.\n \n\n Symptoms to look out for\n People with SCA may have symptoms that appear at ages 5\u20136 months, including:\n \n\n painful swelling in hands and feet\n tiredness\n fussiness\n jaundice, which describes yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes\n SCA symptoms can vary between people. Individuals with SCA may also developTrusted Source severe complications, such as:\n \n\n acute chest syndrome\n frequent serious infections\n severe anemia, which may cause shortness of breath and tiredness, among other symptoms\n sickle cell pain crises\n delayed growth\n lung problems\n strokes\n Sickle cell anemia diagnosis\n Healthcare professionals typically diagnoseTrusted Source SCA blood tests. They usually do so during pregnancy or soon after birth as part of routine screening. Healthcare professionals now test all newborns in the United States for SCA.\n \n\n People can have testing at any age to determine if they have SCA. They can also have blood or genetic testing to find out if they are at risk of having a child with the condition. They may carry the genes necessary for their children to have SCA, even if they do not have it themselves.\n \n\n Sickle cell anemia treatment\n People with SCA need lifelong treatment, which may include:\n \n\n preventing or managing painful episodes with self-care methods, such as staying hydrated and warm\n regular blood transfusions for a person\u2019s symptoms or damage due to SCA\n emergency blood transfusions if a person develops severe anemia\n medication to reduce symptoms, such as hydroxyurea\n pain relief medications\n daily antibiotics for children under 5 yearsTrusted Source and regular vaccinations to reduce their risk of infection\n The only approved therapies that may be able to cure SCD are bone marrow or stem cell transplants.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute states that SCD affects more than 20 millionTrusted Source individuals worldwide.\n \n\n However, the CDC also states the exact number of people in the United States with SCD is unknown. They estimate that:\n \n\n SCD affects approximately 100,000 people in the United States.\n around 1 out of every 365 Black or African American babies have SCD\n around 1 out of every 16,300 Hispanic American babies have SCD\n There is a lack of current scientific data about how many people have SCA, which is a severe formTrusted Source of SCD. A 2022 review of research stated that more than 312,000Trusted Source children are born with SCA annually. However, the review used older data from 2011 to 2013 to provide this statistic.\n \n\n Sickle cell anemia risk factors\n SCA is a genetic condition that a person has from birthTrusted Source, so people cannot develop it any other way. People refer to the atypical genes that characterize the condition and cause SCA as sickle cell genes.\n \n\n If a person has one sickle cell gene, they have sickle cell trait (SCT). People with SCT typically do not have health problems as a result of the gene. However, they can still pass the sickle cell gene on if they have children.\n \n\n If someone inherits two sickle cell genes, they will have a form of SCD that may include SCA. They inherit one gene from each biological parent. If they have SCA, both their parents must have had SCD, SCT, or SCA.\n \n\n SCD is more common in some ethnic groups, such as:\n \n\n people of African descent\n Hispanic Americans from Central and South America\n people with Middle Eastern heritage\n individuals of Asian descent\n people with Indian heritage\n individuals of Mediterranean descent\n According to the CDC, approximately 1 in 13Trusted Source Black or African American babies have SCT.\n \n\n Learn more about SCA in African Americans.\n \n\n Symptoms to look out for\n People with SCA may have symptoms that appear at ages 5\u20136 months, including:\n \n\n painful swelling in hands and feet\n tiredness\n fussiness\n jaundice, which describes yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes\n SCA symptoms can vary between people. Individuals with SCA may also developTrusted Source severe complications, such as:\n \n\n acute chest syndrome\n frequent serious infections\n severe anemia, which may cause shortness of breath and tiredness, among other symptoms\n sickle cell pain crises\n delayed growth\n lung problems\n strokes\n Sickle cell anemia diagnosis\n Healthcare professionals typically diagnoseTrusted Source SCA blood tests. They usually do so during pregnancy or soon after birth as part of routine screening. Healthcare professionals now test all newborns in the United States for SCA.\n \n\n People can have testing at any age to determine if they have SCA. They can also have blood or genetic testing to find out if they are at risk of having a child with the condition. They may carry the genes necessary for their children to have SCA, even if they do not have it themselves.\n \n\n Sickle cell anemia treatment\n People with SCA need lifelong treatment, which may include:\n \n\n preventing or managing painful episodes with self-care methods, such as staying hydrated and warm\n regular blood transfusions for a person\u2019s symptoms or damage due to SCA\n emergency blood transfusions if a person develops severe anemia\n medication to reduce symptoms, such as hydroxyurea\n pain relief medications\n daily antibiotics for children under 5 yearsTrusted Source and regular vaccinations to reduce their risk of infection\n The only approved therapies that may be able to cure SCD are bone marrow or stem cell transplants. However, both these treatments carry significant risks \u2014 they may have serious side effects or be fatal.\n \n\n Summary\n Sickle cell anemia (SCA) is an inherited condition that affects a person\u2019s red blood cells. It is a severe form of sickle cell disease (CSD). Some estimates suggest SCA affects hundreds of thousandsTrusted Source of people worldwide, while other health experts believe SCD affects millionsTrusted Source.\n \n\n People with forms of SCD have symptoms that can vary in severity, and some complications of SCD can be potentially fatal.\n \n\n However, there are a range of treatments to help manage the symptoms of SCD.\n https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/how-common-is-sickle-cell-anemia#summary\n \n\n ================\n <QUESTION>\n =======\n My aunt was just diagnosed with sickle cell anemia.

This architectural style represents a significant departure from traditional monolithic structures, offering enhanced scalability, flexibility, and resilience. However, it also introduces new challenges that must be carefully considered during implementation.\n Microservices vs. Monolithic Architectures\n Scalability:\n Monolithic architectures, characterized by their single-tiered software application structure, often face scalability issues as the codebase grows. Scaling requires replication of the entire application, leading to inefficient resource utilization. In contrast, microservices allow for independent scaling of individual components. This granular scalability enables organizations to allocate resources more efficiently, scaling only the services that require additional capacity.\n Deployment:\n Deployment in monolithic systems typically involves updating the entire application, even for minor changes. This process can be time-consuming and risky, potentially affecting the entire system's stability. Microservices, however, facilitate continuous deployment and integration (CI/CD) practices. Each service can be deployed independently, reducing deployment complexity and allowing for more frequent updates with minimal system-wide impact.\n Fault Isolation:\n In monolithic architectures, a fault in any module can potentially bring down the entire system. Microservices architecture inherently provides better fault isolation. Since services are independent, a failure in one service does not necessarily affect the others, enhancing overall system resilience.\n Challenges in Adopting Microservices\n While microservices offer numerous advantages, their adoption is not without challenges:\n \n\n Data Consistency:\n Maintaining data consistency across distributed services is a significant challenge. The distributed nature of microservices often necessitates the implementation of eventual consistency models, which can complicate application logic and user experience. Techniques such as event sourcing and CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) are often employed to address these issues, but they introduce their own complexities.\n Inter-service Communication:\n As the number of services grows, the complexity of inter-service communication increases exponentially. This can lead to network latency issues and potential points of failure. Implementing robust service discovery mechanisms, efficient load balancing, and resilient communication patterns (e.g., circuit breakers, retries) becomes crucial.\n Distributed Transactions:\n Ensuring transactional integrity across multiple services is challenging. The lack of a centralized database often requires the implementation of complex distributed transaction patterns such as the Saga pattern or two-phase commit protocols.\n Operational Complexity:\n The distributed nature of microservices increases operational complexity. Monitoring, logging, and debugging become more challenging as the system is spread across multiple services. Implementing comprehensive observability solutions becomes essential for effective system management.\n Service Boundaries:\n Defining appropriate service boundaries is crucial for the success of a microservices architecture. Incorrectly defined boundaries can lead to tightly coupled services, negating many of the benefits of this architectural style.\n \n\n Implementation Considerations\n When implementing a microservices architecture, several key factors must be considered:\n \n\n API Gateway:\n An API gateway acts as a single entry point for all client requests, routing them to appropriate services. It can also handle cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, rate limiting, and request/response transformation.\n Service Discovery:\n Dynamic service discovery mechanisms are essential in microservices environments where service instances may come and go frequently. Tools like Consul or Eureka are often used for this purpose.\n Containerization and Orchestration:\n Container technologies like Docker, coupled with orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes, have become de facto standards in microservices deployments. They provide consistency across development and production environments and facilitate efficient resource utilization.\n Event-Driven Architecture:\n Adopting an event-driven approach can help decouple services and improve system responsiveness. Technologies like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ are commonly used for implementing event-driven architectures in microservices.\n Polyglot Persistence:\n Microservices allow for the use of different data storage technologies for different services based on their specific requirements. This polyglot persistence approach can optimize data storage and retrieval for each service.\n \n\n Conclusion\n Microservices architecture offers significant advantages in terms of scalability, deployment flexibility, and fault isolation.

III, \u00a72, cl. 3, and its Vicinage Clause, Amdt. 6. Smith argued that trial in the Northern District of Florida was improper because he had accessed StrikeLines\u2019 website from his home in Mobile (in the Southern District of Alabama) and the servers storing StrikeLines\u2019 data were located in Orlando (in the Middle District of Florida).  The District Court concluded that factual disputes related to venue should be resolved by the jury and denied Smith\u2019s motion to dismiss without prejudice.  The jury found Smith guilty, and Smith moved for a judgment of acquittal based on improper venue.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 29. The District Court denied the motion, reasoning that the effects of Smith\u2019s crime were felt at StrikeLines\u2019 headquarters, located in the Northern District of Florida. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit determined that venue was improper, but disagreed with Smith that a trial in an improper venue barred reprosecution.

Let me start by laying out our results for this\nquarter. Our Q3 total company revenue was $9.1 billion, up 1% year-over-year and 6% over Q2. Our global\ncomparable store sales declined 3% year-over-year driven by a negative 2% comp growth in North America and a\nnegative 14% comp growth in China and partially offset by strong performance in Japan. Our global operating\nmargins contracted by 70 basis points to 16.7% and overall earnings per share for the quarter was $0.93.\nOur total company results were in line with guidance, but international performance, particularly in China, was\nchallenged. We are not satisfied with the results, but our actions are making an impact, leading business and\noperational indicators are trending in the right direction ahead of our financial results and our runway for\nimprovement is long.\nWe see green shoots in our US business driven by the three-part action plan outlined last quarter. First, meet and\nunlock capacity for new demand through a relentless focus on improvements to our US store operations and on\nelevating the experience we create for our partners and customers. Second, attract new customers and drive\ntransaction growth by launching and integrating more exciting new products with relevant marketing while\nmaintaining our focus on core coffee forward offerings. And third, reach new customers, and demonstrate our\nvalue by making sure customers believe the Starbucks experience is worth it every time.\nFirst, our largest opportunity, meet and unlock capacity for new demand. A relentless focus on improving\noperational execution across our nearly 10,000 US company-operated stores is the cornerstone of our near term\nplan. While it is early days of progress, our plan is working.\nIf you walk away from today's call with one thought, let it be the significant changes and long-term upside potential\ntaking place within our US stores and across our end-to-end supply chain to unlock growth, enhance the\ncustomer experience, and drive cost efficiencies.\nWithin our stores, we've seen material positive momentum across core store health and performance metrics with\nnotable improvements in partner scheduling and turnover, critical store issues, and inventory management.\nStores ranked in our top two operational performance quartiles reached a new high during the quarter, a 28%\nupwards shift from Q2, but we have more opportunity.\nOur focus on operational excellence driven by Reinvention plan has led to a multi-second year-over-year\nimprovement in out-of-the-window times, a nearly 50% reduction in calls received by our Customer Contact\nCenter for my order took too long and Mobile Order & Pay and delivery uptime rates of 99%. These are key\nindicators of our work to drive growth by addressing customer wait times, product availability, and the customer\nexperience.\nThis quarter, we also introduced phase one of our Siren Craft System, which includes several process and\npartner driven enhancements to our US store operations. Changes include a new peak time play caller role,\nstrategic investments in partner hours, training, new routines, simple enhancements to technology, and an\nevolved beverage build process. Early deployment across 1,200 stores demonstrated a material incremental\nimprovement across key performance, throughput efficiency, and reliability metrics. Encouraged by this, we fully\ndeployed Siren Craft System process improvements across our entire portfolio of US company-operated stores\nthis week.\nLater this quarter, we will begin rolling out a simple refit to our espresso machines which we expect to improve\nespresso throughput by up to 15% without compromising quality, and with a minor software change in our store\nproduction systems, we have a similar ability to improve food throughput. When paired with Siren System\nequipment announced as part of our Reinvention plan, these new processes become a force multiplier that we\nexpect to drive a true step change improvement.\nEarly assessments demonstrate the capability to drive a 10 to 20 second wait time reduction and a resulting comp\nopportunity range of 1% to 1.5%.\nLeveraging our Deep Brew analytics platform, we have identified customer experience outlier stores,\napproximately 10% of our network, and have developed targeted plans to address and improve them including\naccelerated Siren System deployment.

We're also accelerating the rollout of digital storyboards with target\ndeployment across most US stores in the next two years, a year earlier than originally anticipated.\nLastly, we're working in other ways to enhance the caf\u00e9 experience. This includes new and expanded seating\noptions that elevate many stores, while upholding a safe and inviting place for partners and customers.\nA key outcome of our operational efforts has been material and sustained improvements to the partner\nexperience. Driven by precision partner-centric staffing and scheduling efforts, we ended the quarter with a new\npost-pandemic low partner turnover rate, the best shift completion rate in two years and a 13% improvement in\naverage hours per partner, now the highest on record.

What can I do to get it dismissed?", "context_document": "Noticing the flashing police lights in your rearview mirror is bad enough. Facing the results of a speeding ticket is much, much worse.\n \n\n A first offense could increase your car insurance base premium by about 15-27 percent; a second minor conviction can inflate it an additional 40 percent. The rate increase doesn't last just a few weeks \u2014 increases last an average of three years.\n \n\n Depending on your driving record and your state's point system, your ticket may cost you your driving privileges. So just how much do you want to lose your license? Read on to find out just how you can beat a speeding ticket, in or out of court.\n \n\n Getting a dismissal\n While it may sound impossible, your state may allow you to simply pretend like your speeding ticket never happened.\n \n\n Find out from your state's DMV or traffic court if there are ways to dismiss your ticket. If you have a clean record and your state allows it, this may be an option.\n \n\n Some southern states defer judgment if you don't get any tickets for the next six months.\n \n\n Rhode Island will even consider dismissal if the amount that exceeded the speed limit is less than 20 miles per hour over the posted limit and you have no vehicular violations in three years.\n \n\n Attend driving school\n Your other option to beat a ticket and stay out of court may be attending a driving school. While each state's policies are different, generally, once you submit your certificate of completion to the court, minor convictions are erased from your record.\n \n\n While this option is more expensive than a simple dismissal, the cost is mostly in time. In some states, classes are offered only once a year or every 18 months, and class time varies between 6 to 8 hours.\n \n\n You may still be subject to paying a fine for your ticket and school tuition, which averages around $50 to $80.

What is the act exactly, and what are some of the pros and cons of the act being repealed?", "context_document": "The Glass-Steagall Act was passed under FDR as a response to the stock market crash of 1929. It effected a wall between commercial banking and investment banking, only to be partially repealed in 1999. While there exists consensus around what the Glass-Steagall Act pertains to, there\u2019s disagreement around its influence on the financial markets. In particular, the debate has centered around the repeal\u2019s effects on the 2008 financial crisis and whether it was a principal cause of the crisis. Notably, it remains relevant despite the introduction of recent legislation. In 2010, the Obama administration enacted the Dodd-Frank Act in response to the financial crisis. Similar to Glass-Steagall, it attempted to promote financial stability and protect the consumer, but Dodd-Frank did not reinstate the repealed provisions of Glass-Steagall.\n \n\n In the aftermath of the 1929 stock market crash, the Pecora Commission was tasked with investigating its causes. The Commission identified issues including risky securities investments that endangered bank deposits, unsound loans made to companies in which banks were invested, and conflicts of interest. Other issues included a blurring of the distinction between uninsured and insured practices, or an abusive practice of requiring joint purchases of multiple products. Congress attempted to address these issues with the Banking Act of 1933 and other legislation.\n \n\n While the effects of the Glass-Steagall Act were wide-ranging, it is equally important to note what the Glass-Steagall Act did not do. Beyond limiting the scope of activities for commercial and investment banks, the Act was not intended to limit the size or volume of such activities. Therefore, returning to the example of J.P. Morgan & Co., while the Act prohibited the bank from conducting all the same activities within a single organization, it did not prohibit the same activities (type and volume) if carried out separately through JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.\n \n\n So when was the Glass-Steagall Act repealed? By the late 1990s, the Glass-Steagall Act had essentially become ineffective. In November 1999, then-President Bill Clinton signed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) into effect. GLBA repealed Sections 20 and 32 of the Glass-Steagall Act, which had prohibited the interlocking of commercial and investment activities. The partial repeal allowed for universal banking, which combines commercial and investment banking services under one roof.\n \n\n Many experts view GLBA as \u201cratifying, rather than revolutionizing\u201d in that it simply formalized a change that was already ongoing. However, GLBA left intact Sections 16 and 21, which are still in place today. These continue to have practical effects on the industry today. For instance, they limit investment management firms such as Bridgewater Associates from offering checking accounts and prohibit commercial banks such as Wells Fargo from dealing in risky securities such as cattle futures.\n \n\n Between 1998 and 2006, the housing market and housing prices rose to previously unseen highs. As many readers already know, the market\u2019s later crash was a primary cause of the Financial Crisis. A major determinant of the housing boom was the utilization of imprudent lending standards and subsequent growth of subprime mortgage loans. Most of these loans were made to homebuyers with factors that prevented them from qualifying for a prime loan. Many subprime loans also included tricky features that kept the initial payments low but subjected borrowers to risk if interest rates rose or house prices declined. Unfortunately, when housing prices started to fall, many borrowers found that they owed more on their houses than they were worth.\n \n\n According to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC), which conducted the official government investigation into the crisis, the percentage of borrowers who defaulted on their mortgages months after the loan nearly doubled from 2006 to late 2007. Suspicious activity reports related to mortgage fraud grew 20-fold between 1996 and 2005, more than doubling between 2005 and 2009 (Chart 4). The losses from this fraud have been estimated at $112 billion.\n \n\n Did the Glass-Steagall Act\u2019s repeal contribute to the deterioration in underwriting standards that fueled the housing boom and eventual collapse? Predictably, opinions are divided.\n \n\n On the one hand, those who believe the absence of Glass-Steagall did not cause the crisis highlight that offering mortgages has always been a core business for commercial banks, and so the banking system has always been exposed to high default rates in residential mortgages. Glass-Steagall was never intended to address or regulate loan qualification standards.\n \n\n In addition, while the Glass-Steagall Act limited the investment activities of commercial banks, it did not prevent non-depositories from extending mortgages that competed with commercial banks, or from selling these mortgages to investment banks. It also did not prevent investment banks from securitizing the mortgages to then sell to institutional investors. Nor did it address the incentives of the institutions that originated mortgages or sold mortgage-related securities. Because it did not directly address these issues, it\u2019s unlikely the Glass-Steagall Act could have prevented the decline in mortgage underwriting standards that led to the housing boom of the 2000s.\n \n\n On the other hand, those who argue that the absence of Glass-Steagall did cause the crisis believe that the decline in underwriting standards was in fact partially, or indirectly, caused by the Act\u2019s absence. Readers will recall from the beginning of the article that Glass-Steagall\u2019s provisions addressed the conflicts of interest and other potential abuses of universal banks. After Glass-Steagall\u2019s repeal, it is feasible that universal banks aimed to establish an initial market share in the securities market by lowering underwriting standards. Separately, universal banks might also self-deal and favor their own interests over those of their customers. Both of these incentives could have led to or exacerbated the decline in underwriting standards.\n \n\n While these results are not entirely conclusive, it does suggest that Glass-Steagall\u2019s absence could have worsened underwriting standards. Had Glass-Steagall been in place, these universal banking institutions would not have been created. Nevertheless, the regulation would not have prevented new, investment-only entrants also looking to gain market share. And as we\u2019ve already mentioned, the Glass-Steagall Act never directly addressed loan qualification standards or prevented non-depositors from extending, repackaging, and selling mortgages. It\u2019s therefore unlikely that the Glass-Steagall Act could have prevented the decline in mortgage underwriting standards, but its absence could have aggravated the situation.\n \n\n The second major topic of discussion related to Glass-Steagall and the financial crisis surrounds the issue of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and systemic risks. When the failure of an institution could result in systemic risks, whereby there would be contagious, widespread harm to financial institutions, it was deemed too big to fail (TBTF). TBTF institutions are so large, interconnected, and important that their failure would be disastrous to the greater economic system. Should they fail, the associated costs are absorbed by government and taxpayers.\n \n\n If one accepts that systemic risk and TBTF institutions were major contributors to the 2008 crisis, then the debate turns to whether the absence of Glass-Steagall contributed to the creation of TBTF institutions and their disastrous effects. After all, the repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999 set in motion the wave of mega-mergers that created huge financial conglomerates, many of which fall firmly within the TBTF camp.\n \n\n Ironically, Glass-Steagall\u2019s repeal actually allowed for the rescue of many large institutions after the crisis: After all, JPMorgan Chase rescued Bear Stearns and Bank of America rescued Merrill Lynch, which would have been impermissible prior to the 1999 repeal. Both were already involved in commercial and investment banking when they saved the two failing investment banks. On balance, therefore, the evidence does not seem to support the view that Glass-Steagall\u2019s absence was a cause of the financial crisis.\n \n\n Overall, while the general consensus is that Glass-Steagall's absence was not a principal cause of the crisis, the underlying culture of excessive risk-taking and short-term profit was real.", "full_prompt": "\"================\n <TEXT PASSAGE>\n =======\n The Glass-Steagall Act was passed under FDR as a response to the stock market crash of 1929.

Beyond limiting the scope of activities for commercial and investment banks, the Act was not intended to limit the size or volume of such activities. Therefore, returning to the example of J.P. Morgan & Co., while the Act prohibited the bank from conducting all the same activities within a single organization, it did not prohibit the same activities (type and volume) if carried out separately through JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.\n \n\n So when was the Glass-Steagall Act repealed? By the late 1990s, the Glass-Steagall Act had essentially become ineffective. In November 1999, then-President Bill Clinton signed the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) into effect. GLBA repealed Sections 20 and 32 of the Glass-Steagall Act, which had prohibited the interlocking of commercial and investment activities. The partial repeal allowed for universal banking, which combines commercial and investment banking services under one roof.\n \n\n Many experts view GLBA as \u201cratifying, rather than revolutionizing\u201d in that it simply formalized a change that was already ongoing. However, GLBA left intact Sections 16 and 21, which are still in place today. These continue to have practical effects on the industry today. For instance, they limit investment management firms such as Bridgewater Associates from offering checking accounts and prohibit commercial banks such as Wells Fargo from dealing in risky securities such as cattle futures.\n \n\n Between 1998 and 2006, the housing market and housing prices rose to previously unseen highs. As many readers already know, the market\u2019s later crash was a primary cause of the Financial Crisis. A major determinant of the housing boom was the utilization of imprudent lending standards and subsequent growth of subprime mortgage loans. Most of these loans were made to homebuyers with factors that prevented them from qualifying for a prime loan. Many subprime loans also included tricky features that kept the initial payments low but subjected borrowers to risk if interest rates rose or house prices declined. Unfortunately, when housing prices started to fall, many borrowers found that they owed more on their houses than they were worth.\n \n\n According to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission (FCIC), which conducted the official government investigation into the crisis, the percentage of borrowers who defaulted on their mortgages months after the loan nearly doubled from 2006 to late 2007. Suspicious activity reports related to mortgage fraud grew 20-fold between 1996 and 2005, more than doubling between 2005 and 2009 (Chart 4). The losses from this fraud have been estimated at $112 billion.\n \n\n Did the Glass-Steagall Act\u2019s repeal contribute to the deterioration in underwriting standards that fueled the housing boom and eventual collapse? Predictably, opinions are divided.\n \n\n On the one hand, those who believe the absence of Glass-Steagall did not cause the crisis highlight that offering mortgages has always been a core business for commercial banks, and so the banking system has always been exposed to high default rates in residential mortgages. Glass-Steagall was never intended to address or regulate loan qualification standards.\n \n\n In addition, while the Glass-Steagall Act limited the investment activities of commercial banks, it did not prevent non-depositories from extending mortgages that competed with commercial banks, or from selling these mortgages to investment banks. It also did not prevent investment banks from securitizing the mortgages to then sell to institutional investors. Nor did it address the incentives of the institutions that originated mortgages or sold mortgage-related securities. Because it did not directly address these issues, it\u2019s unlikely the Glass-Steagall Act could have prevented the decline in mortgage underwriting standards that led to the housing boom of the 2000s.\n \n\n On the other hand, those who argue that the absence of Glass-Steagall did cause the crisis believe that the decline in underwriting standards was in fact partially, or indirectly, caused by the Act\u2019s absence. Readers will recall from the beginning of the article that Glass-Steagall\u2019s provisions addressed the conflicts of interest and other potential abuses of universal banks. After Glass-Steagall\u2019s repeal, it is feasible that universal banks aimed to establish an initial market share in the securities market by lowering underwriting standards. Separately, universal banks might also self-deal and favor their own interests over those of their customers. Both of these incentives could have led to or exacerbated the decline in underwriting standards.\n \n\n While these results are not entirely conclusive, it does suggest that Glass-Steagall\u2019s absence could have worsened underwriting standards. Had Glass-Steagall been in place, these universal banking institutions would not have been created. Nevertheless, the regulation would not have prevented new, investment-only entrants also looking to gain market share. And as we\u2019ve already mentioned, the Glass-Steagall Act never directly addressed loan qualification standards or prevented non-depositors from extending, repackaging, and selling mortgages. It\u2019s therefore unlikely that the Glass-Steagall Act could have prevented the decline in mortgage underwriting standards, but its absence could have aggravated the situation.\n \n\n The second major topic of discussion related to Glass-Steagall and the financial crisis surrounds the issue of \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d and systemic risks. When the failure of an institution could result in systemic risks, whereby there would be contagious, widespread harm to financial institutions, it was deemed too big to fail (TBTF). TBTF institutions are so large, interconnected, and important that their failure would be disastrous to the greater economic system. Should they fail, the associated costs are absorbed by government and taxpayers.\n \n\n If one accepts that systemic risk and TBTF institutions were major contributors to the 2008 crisis, then the debate turns to whether the absence of Glass-Steagall contributed to the creation of TBTF institutions and their disastrous effects. After all, the repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999 set in motion the wave of mega-mergers that created huge financial conglomerates, many of which fall firmly within the TBTF camp.\n \n\n Ironically, Glass-Steagall\u2019s repeal actually allowed for the rescue of many large institutions after the crisis: After all, JPMorgan Chase rescued Bear Stearns and Bank of America rescued Merrill Lynch, which would have been impermissible prior to the 1999 repeal. Both were already involved in commercial and investment banking when they saved the two failing investment banks. On balance, therefore, the evidence does not seem to support the view that Glass-Steagall\u2019s absence was a cause of the financial crisis.\n \n\n Overall, while the general consensus is that Glass-Steagall's absence was not a principal cause of the crisis, the underlying culture of excessive risk-taking and short-term profit was real.\n https://www.toptal.com/finance/investment-banking-freelancer/glass-steagall-act\n \n\n ================\n <QUESTION>\n =======\n I remember vaguely hearing about the Glass-Steagall Act while I was in college and that it was removed.

This year, Americans plan to spend around $10.6 billion\u2014that\u2019s billion with a B\u2014on Halloween.1 That\u2019s about $100 per person! \n \n\n If you\u2019re tight on cash, spending that much might sound scary. But the good news is: You don\u2019t have to spend a zombie arm and a leg to have a good time. Try these seven tricks to stick to your Halloween budget.\n \n\n 1. Costumes\n One of my favorite parts of Halloween is the costumes, hands down\u2014from seeing adorable babies dressed as koalas to entire families decked out as the Addams Family. But when you start buying costumes for your own family, you realize just how pricey they can get! So, instead of buying a $40 Ninja Turtles costume for each of your four boys or sewing some DIY versions from scratch, turn hunting for costumes into a family game.\n \n\n Here\u2019s how it works: Head to the consignment shop or thrift store with your family and give each of your kids an envelope with $5 or $10 inside. Split up into teams to pick out a costume or find materials to make a custom creation. When time\u2019s up and purchases are made, head home and have the kids dig into their closets for the rest of their costumes. There\u2019s nothing like a happy homemade Halloween!\n \n\n Don\u2019t forget, just like kids grow out of clothes, they also grow out of Halloween costumes. Check with your friends and neighbors to see if they\u2019ll let you borrow a costume this year. You don\u2019t need to drop big money for a brand-new Hulk outfit when little Timmy down the street has one your kid can borrow for the night.\n \n\n 2. Decorations\n Halloween is a really big deal for some people\u2014and a single pumpkin on the front porch just won\u2019t cut it (especially if you\u2019re easily inspired by fall d\u00e9cor on Instagram and Pinterest). But if you\u2019re not careful, buying Halloween d\u00e9cor year after year can really take a bite out of your budget. Pro tip: If you need to stretch a dollar, hit up your local dollar store for decorations.\n \n\n And if you love going all out for Halloween, start saving and reusing your decorations. Since Halloween is almost as big of a deal as Christmas at your house, prep for it the same way. Instead of throwing away decorations at the end of the season, save some to reuse each year. Store your ghouls and goblins in a reusable tub once the season is over, and pull them out next year.\n \n\n 3. Candy\n It\u2019s no secret that candy is pricey stuff. But living in a neighborhood that gets carloads of kids every year doesn\u2019t mean you have to buy barrels of candy. If you know you\u2019ll be visited by 50 to 100 princesses and superheroes, skip the fancy chocolate bars and grab a bulk bag of assorted candy instead. Be on the lookout for coupons and any two-for-one deals, but don\u2019t feel like you need to get the brand-name stuff either. Just buy what you can afford, even if that means store brand.\n \n\n Trick-or-treaters get a lot of sugar, so don\u2019t think you\u2019re holding out on them if you buy generic. And when the candy\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone. Early birds get the gummy worms, and when you\u2019ve run out, you can turn the lights off and relax.\n \n\n And one more tip when it comes to candy\u2014keep track of how many trick-or-treaters visit your house so you can plan for next year. There\u2019s no need to overbuy and get stuck eating all the leftovers (unless that\u2019s what you were hoping for).\n \n\n 4. Pumpkins\n For something that turns into a pile of moldy mush a few weeks after you buy it, pumpkins sure cost a pretty penny. And they\u2019re kind of like potato chips: You can\u2019t have just one. It can be super tempting to stage 20 pumpkins across our porches, decks and tables.\n \n\n Money\n Start budgeting with EveryDollar today!\n \n\n Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014pumpkins are fun. But it\u2019s way too easy to overspend on them. So give yourself a pumpkin budget. Seriously. Let the kids each pick one or cap yourself at $15. That way, you can keep the spending in check.\n \n\n And when you\u2019re ready to buy pumpkins, going to the pumpkin patch is a blast, but not the best place to buy them if you\u2019re on a budget. Instead, buy pumpkins from the grocery store, and look for two-for-one deals that pop up. Because when it all boils down to it, a pumpkin is a pumpkin.\n \n\n 5. Greeting Cards\n Do people really send out Halloween greeting cards? When was the last time you got a \u201cHave a Batty Halloween\u201d card in your mailbox? Well, nearly 45% of those surveyed by the National Retail Federation in 2021 said they planned to buy Halloween greeting cards, so somebody\u2019s doing it.2\n \n\n But you can make a spooky greeting card without dropping $6 on a glitter-bomb skeleton card for your favorite niece. Use some cardstock and get creative by drawing all kinds of creepy characters. Don\u2019t forget to tape on a little something sweet too! However, if your heart is set on a store-bought card, look for the two-for-a-dollar kind. And remember, you don\u2019t have to send a card.\n \n\n 6. Fall Activities\n There are plenty of harvest and Halloween festivals this time of year\u2014and they\u2019re usually free! Plus, there are plenty of other budget-friendly activities for the family. Spend the day walking around a farm or enjoying a hayride. Take a drive out of town to look at the leaves changing colors. Go apple picking or enjoy a fall festival. Take advantage of what\u2019s already going on in your church or community, and budget a little extra for any special food or rides. Festive fall food can really add up if you\u2019re not careful, so save some cash by packing a picnic and a comfy quilt.\n \n\n 7. Family Traditions\n Pick out a weekend or two for some quality time together with friends or your family this fall. If you\u2019re tired of carving pumpkins or dressing up, why not start some new budget-friendly traditions?\n \n\n How about a fall-themed cooking or baking day? Try caramel apples, pumpkin pie and jack-o\u2019-lantern pizzas (use pepperoni and veggies to make the face). Or have everyone vote for their favorite fall movies, then hunker down on the couch to get cozy and eat all those tasty treats you cooked up while you watch.

Please explain in 4 sentences or less, and make sure there's no jargon.", "context_document": "Handles dilution from competitive pairs\n Interleaved designs also drive up sensitivity by showing if the experience exposed to the user is truly different between treatment and control. An interleaved design generates final output from two lists, allowing us to identify immediately whether those lists are too similar, as shown in Figure 4 below. In most machine learning applications, different modeling approaches are improvings things on the margin. In many cases, the search results returned by two rankers will largely overlap. An interleaved design lets us measure this overlap and analyze the data for competitive pairs \u2014 where rankers disagree on the recommendation \u2014 which leads to a signal boost. \n \n\n \n\n Figure 4: The original lists used here in interleaving are essentially identical except for the last elements. This means that if a user clicks on any of the top four choices, they are not actually contributing to signaling which ranker is preferred. \n Handles dilution from non-engagement\n An interesting observation we made when looking at interleaved experiments \u2013 as well as search and ranking experiments in general \u2013 is that many user actions make it look as if the user is not paying attention or making any choices on the presented content. For instance, although we would generate a carousel with interleaved options, the user would not actively engage with the content and make a decision. As a result, including this data in interleaved analyses dilutes the signal.\n \n\n Here is another way to understand non-engagement. Let's say we present a user with two drinks \u2013 Coke and Pepsi \u2013 and ask them which they like more. If the user does not engage or refuses to try any options, it might indicate:\n \n\n The user is not interested in the presented results.\n The user is not in a decision-making mindset at the moment.\n While these are important insights, examining data from this undifferentiated feedback does not help to determine user preference or understand which drink is preferred. Attention and non-engagement is a fascinating research subject; many folks approach it by looking at additional metrics such as dwell time or how often a user backtracks as per Chucklin and Rijke, 2016. Fortunately, interleaving allows us to identify non-engagement more effectively so that we may remove impressions that are not meaningful. If a user does not take an action, we simply remove the exposure rather than marking the performance of the interleaved ranker as a tie.ctively so that we may remove impressions that are not meaningful. If a user does not take an action, we simply remove the exposure rather than marking the performance of the interleaved ranker as a tie.

An interleaved design generates final output from two lists, allowing us to identify immediately whether those lists are too similar, as shown in Figure 4 below. In most machine learning applications, different modeling approaches are improvings things on the margin. In many cases, the search results returned by two rankers will largely overlap. An interleaved design lets us measure this overlap and analyze the data for competitive pairs \u2014 where rankers disagree on the recommendation \u2014 which leads to a signal boost. \n \n\n \n\n Figure 4: The original lists used here in interleaving are essentially identical except for the last elements. This means that if a user clicks on any of the top four choices, they are not actually contributing to signaling which ranker is preferred. \n Handles dilution from non-engagement\n An interesting observation we made when looking at interleaved experiments \u2013 as well as search and ranking experiments in general \u2013 is that many user actions make it look as if the user is not paying attention or making any choices on the presented content. For instance, although we would generate a carousel with interleaved options, the user would not actively engage with the content and make a decision. As a result, including this data in interleaved analyses dilutes the signal.\n \n\n Here is another way to understand non-engagement. Let's say we present a user with two drinks \u2013 Coke and Pepsi \u2013 and ask them which they like more. If the user does not engage or refuses to try any options, it might indicate:\n \n\n The user is not interested in the presented results.\n The user is not in a decision-making mindset at the moment.\n While these are important insights, examining data from this undifferentiated feedback does not help to determine user preference or understand which drink is preferred. Attention and non-engagement is a fascinating research subject; many folks approach it by looking at additional metrics such as dwell time or how often a user backtracks as per Chucklin and Rijke, 2016. Fortunately, interleaving allows us to identify non-engagement more effectively so that we may remove impressions that are not meaningful. If a user does not take an action, we simply remove the exposure rather than marking the performance of the interleaved ranker as a tie.ctively so that we may remove impressions that are not meaningful.

This two-part Sidebar examines the circuit split. Part I provides an overview of the Family\nSmoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (TCA) regulatory framework, relevant FDA actions related\nto ENDS products, and the agency\u2019s review and denial of the PMTAs involving flavored ENDS products.\nPart II provides an overview of the litigation challenging those FDA orders, the court decisions to date,\nand certain preliminary observations for consideration by Congress.\nBackground on TCA\u2019s Statutory Framework\nIn 2009, Congress enacted the TCA, which established the central federal regulatory regime for the\nmanufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products. Among other things, the TCA required all\nnew tobacco products\u2014that is, those not commercially marketed in the United States prior to February\n15, 2007\u2014to receive prior authorization from FDA before they can be marketed to the public. In\nestablishing this regulatory regime, the TCA aims to balance competing interests in protecting the public\u2019s\nhealth against the harmful effects of smoking and youth tobacco use, while preserving access to lawfully\nmarketed tobacco products for adult consumers. To further this goal, the TCA grants FDA \u201cprimary\nFederal regulatory authority\u201d over tobacco products and establishes a premarket review process for new\ntobacco products. Such products generally may not be marketed until the manufacturer submits a PMTA\nand receives a marketing granted order (MGO) from the Center for Tobacco Products, established within\nFDA to implement the TCA.\nThe TCA permits FDA to issue an MGO only upon certain findings, including a conclusion that\n\u201cpermitting such tobacco product to be marketed would be appropriate for the protection of the public\nhealth,\u201d or APPH. This APPH determination must be made \u201cwith respect to the risks and benefits to the\npopulation as a whole, including users and nonusers of the tobacco product,\u201d taking into account the\nlikelihood that existing users of tobacco products will stop using such products and the likelihood that\nthose who do not use such products will start using them. The TCA directs FDA, in making this\nevaluation, to consult a range of evidence, including \u201cinformation submitted to the Secretary as part of the\n[PMTA] and any other information before the Secretary with respect to such tobacco product.\u201d Such\ninformation may include \u201cwhen appropriate . . . well-controlled investigations, which may include 1 or\nmore clinical investigations by experts qualified by training and experience to evaluate the tobacco\nproduct,\u201d as well as other \u201cvalid scientific evidence\u201d determined by the Secretary to be sufficient to\nevaluate the tobacco product.\nWhile the TCA explicitly applies to cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and smokeless\ntobacco, the statute also authorizes FDA to deem other tobacco products subject to the law. In 2016, FDA\ninvoked this authority and promulgated what is known as the Deeming Rule, which subjected ENDS\nproducts to the TCA\u2019s regulatory regime.\n", "full_prompt": "You must draw your answer from the below text only.

The Eleventh and Fifth Circuits, on the other hand,\nhave sided with the ENDS manufacturers and vacated FDA\u2019s MDOs, remanding the applications to FDA\nfor reconsideration. This circuit split sets the stage for potential Supreme Court review regarding what\ninformation FDA may require applicants seeking to market flavored ENDS products to provide as part of\nCongressional Research Service\nhttps://crsreports.congress.gov\nLSB11141\nCongressional Research Service 2\ntheir PMTAs. This two-part Sidebar examines the circuit split. Part I provides an overview of the Family\nSmoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (TCA) regulatory framework, relevant FDA actions related\nto ENDS products, and the agency\u2019s review and denial of the PMTAs involving flavored ENDS products.\nPart II provides an overview of the litigation challenging those FDA orders, the court decisions to date,\nand certain preliminary observations for consideration by Congress.\nBackground on TCA\u2019s Statutory Framework\nIn 2009, Congress enacted the TCA, which established the central federal regulatory regime for the\nmanufacture, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products. Among other things, the TCA required all\nnew tobacco products\u2014that is, those not commercially marketed in the United States prior to February\n15, 2007\u2014to receive prior authorization from FDA before they can be marketed to the public. In\nestablishing this regulatory regime, the TCA aims to balance competing interests in protecting the public\u2019s\nhealth against the harmful effects of smoking and youth tobacco use, while preserving access to lawfully\nmarketed tobacco products for adult consumers. To further this goal, the TCA grants FDA \u201cprimary\nFederal regulatory authority\u201d over tobacco products and establishes a premarket review process for new\ntobacco products. Such products generally may not be marketed until the manufacturer submits a PMTA\nand receives a marketing granted order (MGO) from the Center for Tobacco Products, established within\nFDA to implement the TCA.\nThe TCA permits FDA to issue an MGO only upon certain findings, including a conclusion that\n\u201cpermitting such tobacco product to be marketed would be appropriate for the protection of the public\nhealth,\u201d or APPH. This APPH determination must be made \u201cwith respect to the risks and benefits to the\npopulation as a whole, including users and nonusers of the tobacco product,\u201d taking into account the\nlikelihood that existing users of tobacco products will stop using such products and the likelihood that\nthose who do not use such products will start using them. The TCA directs FDA, in making this\nevaluation, to consult a range of evidence, including \u201cinformation submitted to the Secretary as part of the\n[PMTA] and any other information before the Secretary with respect to such tobacco product.\u201d Such\ninformation may include \u201cwhen appropriate . . . well-controlled investigations, which may include 1 or\nmore clinical investigations by experts qualified by training and experience to evaluate the tobacco\nproduct,\u201d as well as other \u201cvalid scientific evidence\u201d determined by the Secretary to be sufficient to\nevaluate the tobacco product.\nWhile the TCA explicitly applies to cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, and smokeless\ntobacco, the statute also authorizes FDA to deem other tobacco products subject to the law. In 2016, FDA\ninvoked this authority and promulgated what is known as the Deeming Rule, which subjected ENDS\nproducts to the TCA\u2019s regulatory regime.\n\nQUESTION\n\nWhat is the deeming rule?"}

{"system_instruction": "Respond using only the information contained in the provided text.", "user_request": "Find and summarize the following three things, using three sentences for each one:\nThe reason for this appeal\nThe judgment\nThe reasons for the judgment", "context_document": "Background to the Appeal This appeal forms part of long-running litigation about discharges of foul water contaminated with untreated sewage into the Manchester Ship Canal. The Supreme Court is asked to decide whether the owner of the beds and banks of the canal, the Manchester Ship Canal Company Ltd (\u201cthe Canal Company\u201d), can bring a claim in nuisance or trespass when the canal is polluted by discharges of foul water from outfalls maintained by the statutory sewerage undertaker, United Utilities Water Ltd (\u201cUnited Utilities\u201d). United Utilities is the statutory sewerage undertaker for the North West of England. Its sewerage network includes around 100 outfalls from which material emanating from sewers, sewage treatment works and pumping stations is discharged into the canal. When it is operating within its hydraulic capacity, the discharges are of surface water or treated effluent, but when the system\u2019s hydraulic capacity is exceeded at least some of the outfalls discharge foul water into the canal. There is no suggestion that these polluting discharges are caused by negligence or deliberate wrongdoing on the part of United Utilities. However, they could be avoided if United Utilities invested in improved infrastructure and treatment processes. The Canal Company threatened to bring a claim against United Utilities for trespass and nuisance. In response, United Utilities asked the court to make a declaration that the Canal Company had no right of action. The court was not asked to decide whether the Canal Company\u2019s claim would be successful on the relevant facts. Rather, the question was whether the claim would be inconsistent with and therefore barred by the statutory scheme for regulating sewerage established by the Water Industry Act 1991 (\u201cthe 1991 Act\u201d). The High Court judge agreed to make the declaration requested by United Utilities. His decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal. The implication of these judgments is that no owner of a canal (or other watercourse or body of water) can bring a claim based on nuisance or trespass against a sewerage undertaker in respect of polluting discharges into the water, unless the sewerage undertaker is guilty of negligence or deliberate wrongdoing. A claim of this kind would be prevented even if the polluting discharges were frequent and had significant and damaging effects on the owner\u2019s commercial or other interests, or on its ability to enjoy its property. The Canal Company appeals to the Supreme Court.\n\nJudgment The Supreme Court unanimously allows the Canal Company\u2019s appeal. It holds that the 1991 Act does not prevent the Canal Company from bringing a claim in nuisance or trespass when the canal is polluted by discharges of foul water from United Utilities\u2019 outfalls, even if there has been no negligence or deliberate misconduct. Lord Reed and Lord Hodge give a joint judgment with which the other members of the Court agree. \n\nReasons for the Judgment The starting point is that the owner of a canal or other watercourse has a property right in the watercourse, including a right to preserve the quality of the water. That right is protected by the common law. The discharge of polluting effluent into a privately-owned watercourse is an actionable nuisance at common law if the pollution interferes with the owner\u2019s use or enjoyment of its property. The Supreme Court is, therefore, asked to decide whether the 1991 Act excludes common law rights of action in nuisance and trespass. This is a question of statutory interpretation [108]-[110]. A body which exercises statutory powers, such as a sewerage undertaker, is liable in the same way as any other person if it is responsible for a nuisance, trespass or other tort, unless either it: (i) is acting within its statutory powers, or (ii) has been granted some statutory immunity from suit. If a sewerage undertaker interferes with a person\u2019s rights, it is therefore necessary to distinguish between interferences which Parliament has authorised, which are lawful, and interferences which Parliament has not authorised, which are unlawful. When drawing this distinction, two principles are relevant. First, a person\u2019s rights to the peaceful enjoyment of its property and to access the courts are protected by both the common law and the Human Rights Act 1998. The principle of legality holds that fundamental rights cannot be overridden by general or ambiguous words. A statute will, therefore, only authorise what would otherwise be an unlawful interference with property rights, or deprive a person of the right to bring a legal claim, if this is clear from or a necessary implication of the express language used by Parliament. Secondly, Parliament will not be taken to have intended that statutory powers should be exercised, or duties performed, in a way which interferes with private rights, unless the interference is inevitable [15]-[21]. The 1991 Act does not expressly authorise United Utilities to cause a nuisance or to trespass by discharging foul water through the outfalls into the canal. United Utilities\u2019 entitlement to use the outfalls derives from section 116 of the 1991 Act. However, this entitlement is subject to a number of statutory protections for watercourses. Section 117(5) provides that nothing in section 116 (or the other relevant sewerage provisions of the 1991 Act) authorises a sewerage undertaker to use a sewer, drain or outfall to convey foul water into a watercourse. Sewerage undertakers therefore do not have statutory authority to discharge untreated sewage into watercourses. Section 117(6) prevents a sewerage undertaker from carrying out its functions under the relevant sewerage provisions so as to create a nuisance. Section 94(4) makes it clear that the common law remedies for nuisance \u2013 such as an injunction or damages \u2013 are available in addition to any remedy available by virtue of section 94. Section 186(3) further protects the owners of watercourses, and other rights-holders, by stating that nothing in the relevant sewerage provisions authorises a sewerage undertaker to damage a watercourse, or the quality of the water in it, without consent [60]-[62], [65], [111]-[112], [116]. The polluting discharges similarly cannot be regarded as having been impliedly authorised by Parliament, since they are not an inevitable consequence of a sewerage undertaker\u2019s performance of its statutory powers and duties. In the present case, the discharges could be avoided if United Utilities invested in improved infrastructure and treatment processes [113]. If Parliament has not authorised an interference with private law rights, it would normally follow that a claimant can enforce those rights at common law. Furthermore, since sections 117(5) and 186(3) limit the authority conferred on sewerage undertakers by the 1991 Act, there must be a common law remedy where those limits are exceeded: otherwise, the sections would have no purpose [114]-[115]. However, United Utilities argues that the Canal Company has no cause of action because the only way to avoid the discharges of foul water into the canal would be to construct new sewerage infrastructure. It relies on the House of Lords\u2019 decision in Marcic v Thames Water Utilities Ltd [2003] UKHL 66 (\u201cMarcic\u201d), which it says established that Parliament\u2019s intention was that the construction of new sewerage infrastructure should be a matter for the Secretary of State or the regulator, the Water Services Regulation Authority (known as \u201cOfwat\u201d), not the courts [106]. The Supreme Court rejects this argument. There are a number of indications that Parliament did not intend the 1991 Act to exclude a claimant\u2019s right to enforce its private property right in a watercourse. First, section 186(7) provides for arbitration where water quality has been damaged without consent, at the option of the party complaining. This strongly suggests that the complainant could alternatively choose to pursue a common law claim [66], [117]. Secondly, section 180 of the 1991 Act gives effect to Schedule 12, which makes provision for statutory compensation. Compensation is available for damage caused by the authorised acts of sewerage undertakers, but not for damage caused by acts which are unauthorised, such as the discharges of foul water into the canal. This indicates that the victims of unauthorised damage retain their common law rights of action. Otherwise, they would be left without any remedy for the damage they have suffered, which would be anomalous. They would also be treated less favourably than the victims of authorised damage, which would be perverse [64], [118]-[121]. Thirdly, depriving the victims of a nuisance or trespass of their common law rights of action would be a substantial change to the law as it stood before the 1991 Act was enacted. It is unlikely that a change of this kind would have been made in a consolidation statute. Consolidation acts are not designed to make substantive changes to the law, but rather to reorganise and restate the existing law so that it is clearer and easier to understand. \n", "full_prompt": "Respond using only the information contained in the provided text. \n\nFind and summarize the following three things, using three sentences for each one:\nThe reason for this appeal\nThe judgment\nThe reasons for the judgment\n\nBackground to the Appeal This appeal forms part of long-running litigation about discharges of foul water contaminated with untreated sewage into the Manchester Ship Canal.

To increase production,\nproducers may attempt to hire more workers by increasing wages. Assuming producers are not\nwilling to eat into profits in order to ramp up production,17 they are likely to increase the prices of\ntheir final goods and services to compensate themselves for the increase in wages (which\nincreases production costs), thereby creating inflation.18 Inflation can work to lower demand and\nincrease supply and thus can be the means to bring supply and demand back into equilibrium,\nparticularly in an overheating economy in which demand has risen above what the economy can\nproduce at full employment.19\nAny number of factors could contribute to increases in aggregate demand, including the normal\nebbs and flows of the business cycle, consumer and investor sentiment, the value of the dollar,\nand fiscal and monetary policy, among others. Expansionary fiscal policies include an increase in\nthe budget deficit by lowering taxes or increasing government spending or transfers to\nindividuals. Such policies work to increase overall spending in the economy by driving up\nconsumer demand, in the case of lower taxes, or both consumer demand and government\npurchases in the case of increased spending. This in turn can lead to increased production and\ndecreasing unemployment levels. The downside to achieving these benefits through expansionary\nfiscal policy is that it can result in demand-pull inflation in the short term, particularly if the\neconomy is at full employment. Expansionary fiscal policy is unlikely to cause sustained\ninflation, as it typically involves temporary increases in spending. Such one-time increases may\nproduce similar one-time increases in inflation but would be likely to cause persistent increases in\ninflation only if such policy were persistently applied. Additionally, monetary policy can\npotentially be used to offset the inflationary effects of such policy.\nCost-Push Inflation\nInflation that is caused by a decrease in aggregate supply as a result of increases in the cost of\nproduction absent a proportional decrease in aggregate demand is known as cost-push inflation.\nAn increase in the cost of raw materials or any of the factors of production\u2014land, labor, capital,\nentrepreneurship\u2014will result in increased production costs.23 Assuming producers\u2019 productivity\nis at or near its maximum, producers will not be able to maintain existing profit margins in\nresponse. Much the same as the demand-side issue, if producers cannot or will not accept lowered\nprofits, they will raise prices.24\nThe classic example of cost-push inflation is the result of a commodity price shock, which\nsharply decreases the supply of a given commodity and increases its price.

If you find that you can not answer the question using only the context provided, say \"There is not enough information in the text provided to sufficiently answer this question.\"\n\nContext:\n\nDemand-Pull Inflation\nInflation that is caused by an increase in aggregate demand (overall spending) absent a\nproportional increase in aggregate supply (overall production) is known as demand-pull inflation.\nWhen aggregate demand increases by more than its trend rate, typically the productive capacity\nof the economy does not immediately adjust to meet higher demand, particularly if the economy\nis at or near full employment.16 In response to the increased demand in the economy, producers\nwill attempt to increase the quantity of goods and services they provide. To increase production,\nproducers may attempt to hire more workers by increasing wages. Assuming producers are not\nwilling to eat into profits in order to ramp up production,17 they are likely to increase the prices of\ntheir final goods and services to compensate themselves for the increase in wages (which\nincreases production costs), thereby creating inflation.18 Inflation can work to lower demand and\nincrease supply and thus can be the means to bring supply and demand back into equilibrium,\nparticularly in an overheating economy in which demand has risen above what the economy can\nproduce at full employment.19\nAny number of factors could contribute to increases in aggregate demand, including the normal\nebbs and flows of the business cycle, consumer and investor sentiment, the value of the dollar,\nand fiscal and monetary policy, among others. Expansionary fiscal policies include an increase in\nthe budget deficit by lowering taxes or increasing government spending or transfers to\nindividuals. Such policies work to increase overall spending in the economy by driving up\nconsumer demand, in the case of lower taxes, or both consumer demand and government\npurchases in the case of increased spending. This in turn can lead to increased production and\ndecreasing unemployment levels. The downside to achieving these benefits through expansionary\nfiscal policy is that it can result in demand-pull inflation in the short term, particularly if the\neconomy is at full employment. Expansionary fiscal policy is unlikely to cause sustained\ninflation, as it typically involves temporary increases in spending. Such one-time increases may\nproduce similar one-time increases in inflation but would be likely to cause persistent increases in\ninflation only if such policy were persistently applied. Additionally, monetary policy can\npotentially be used to offset the inflationary effects of such policy.\nCost-Push Inflation\nInflation that is caused by a decrease in aggregate supply as a result of increases in the cost of\nproduction absent a proportional decrease in aggregate demand is known as cost-push inflation.\nAn increase in the cost of raw materials or any of the factors of production\u2014land, labor, capital,\nentrepreneurship\u2014will result in increased production costs.23 Assuming producers\u2019 productivity\nis at or near its maximum, producers will not be able to maintain existing profit margins in\nresponse. Much the same as the demand-side issue, if producers cannot or will not accept lowered\nprofits, they will raise prices.24\nThe classic example of cost-push inflation is the result of a commodity price shock, which\nsharply decreases the supply of a given commodity and increases its price. Certain commodities\nare inputs in the production process, and as the price of an important input good increases, so\ndoes the price of the final goods and services, resulting in inflation. Cost-push inflation,\nespecially when caused by a supply shock, tends to result in only a temporary increase in inflation\nunless accommodated by monetary policy.

For the five year period ending in September of 2006, the S&P 500 Aerospace\r\nand Defense industry index had outperformed the S&P 500 by 71%. The result for the three\r\nyear period was the same. The industry returned 87%, while the S&P 500 returned 42%.\r\n\r\nThe Aerospace industry has been revitalized and has been booming due to a strong wave\r\nof global economic growth and the emergence of countries such as China and India as\r\neconomic powers. The rise of wealth in the Middle East has also added to the booming\r\nsuccess. This massive growth throughout the world has spurred huge gains in business\r\ntravel, as well as in air cargo traffic. Boeing saw its orders from China jump to 143\r\ncommercial jets in 2005, and 114 for the nine months through September 2006. India\r\nordered 98 planes from Boeing in 2005. Middle East orders also rose to 44 in 2005. Also,\r\nrising income levels, in some countries, have added to the company\u2019s success, due to the\r\ngreater mobility amongst people in such regions.\r\n\r\nThe defense market has experienced massive growth since the terrorist attacks of 2001,\r\nas a result of the U.S. government funding the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. Since the wars\r\nhave begun, the U.S. government and the governments of other nations have splurged and\r\nput a lot of money into defense. Safety and national security has become a huge profit\r\ngainer for the Aerospace and Defense industry. Also, it is believed that the United States\r\nand its allies are locked in a struggle for control that will continue in years to come. This will\r\nincrease the need for expenditures in the future for military equipment. One issue that has\r\nrisen is that while defense is benefiting from the current environment in which we live, air\r\ntravel is not, as a result of the attacks in 2001. This could very well decrease commercial\r\nair travel.\r\n\fCommercial Aircraft\r\n\r\nBased on total unit orders of 100-plus seat jetliners in 2005 (latest available), Boeing and\r\nAirbus control about 49% and 51%, respectively, of the global commercial jetliner market.\r\nDemand for jetliners is driven primarily by growth in the global 100-plus seat commercial\r\naircraft fleet. Independent research firm Avitas Inc., projects that the global fleet of 100-\r\nplus seat jetliners will grow at a 4.3% compound annual rate over the next 20 years, due to\r\nits projection of a 5.9% compound annual growth in passenger traffic over the same period.\r\nWe believe that, given the economic development of many former third-world countries in\r\nAsia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, etc., fleet growth should continue at an above-\r\naverage rate for the foreseeable future.\r\n\r\nOne of the things that helps Boeing in this segment of their business is their Six Sigma\r\nmethodology. Six Sigma aids manufacturers in their quest to design, build and deliver near-\r\nperfect products by reducing defects and variation, and improving quality, resulting in\r\nsubstantial cost savings. Six Sigma refers to manufacturing processes that produce a level\r\nof quality at 3.4 defects per million opportunities. Most U.S. companies operate at a rate of\r\n66,807 defects per million, or \"3.0 Sigma.\" Boeings\u2019 current main plant location is\r\nin Seattle, Washington. Although Boeing mostly outsourcers many of its business\r\nproducts and flies them in, they still remain to have a presence in the States.\r\n\r\nMilitary Segment\r\n\r\nExamining Boeings\u2019 military weapons segment, demand for IDS's equipment and systems\r\nis primarily driven by growth in the procurement and Research and Development sectors\r\nof the U.S. defense budget, which accounts for about 40% of global military weapons\r\nspending. Based on U.S. Department of Defense statistics, from fiscal year 1995 through\r\nfiscal year 2005, the procurement and Research and Development sectors of the total\r\nU.S. defense budget grew at 8.0% and 5.1% average annual rates, respectively. It is\r\nbelieved that two factors contributed to this strong growth: cuts to the defense budget that\r\noccurred during the Clinton presidential administration, which resulted in the need for\r\nincreased defense spending in later years, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We expect\r\ndefense budgets to continue to grow, but at much slower rates, going forward. This will be\r\nespecially evident as the U.S. decreases its presence in Iraq in the near future.\r\n\fOutlook on Aerospace and Defense\r\n\r\nThe fundamental outlook for the Aerospace & Defense industry is positive. We believe\r\nmany companies in the Aerospace & Defense area will record solid earnings per share\r\ngains in the near term, due to our nation's current military action, plus the high growth in\r\nnations such as China and India. The outlook for the defense segment is strongly positive.\r\nWe believe that the ongoing military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, potential threats from\r\nIslamic terrorists, North Korea and Iran, as well as a military buildup in China, will make it\r\nnecessary to continue funding the defense segment. At the same time, we believe that a\r\nnumber of defense contractors have become more efficient, have shown strong cash flow,\r\nand have engaged in significant share repurchases and dividend increases. However, there\r\nis also the potential likelihood of the risk of declining defense spending following the recent\r\nDemocratic win of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe outlook for the commercial aircraft segment is especially positive. In looking at the 100-\r\nplus-seat commercial aircraft-making sector, we expect that the global airline industry, the\r\nlargest customer of passenger jets, will continue to have strong passenger traffic growth,\r\nwhich the International Air Transport Associations projects at over 4.5% in 2007. Following\r\nthe 9/11 attacks, global airlines were hit by large declines in air traffic. However, passenger\r\ntraffic has picked up significantly in recent years, boosted by global economic growth and\r\nattractive fares.\r\n\r\nBoeing currently has a higher price-to-earnings ratio than typically desired for a value\r\ninvestor. However, this high ratio is due to Boeings\u2019 very high growth potential. Boeing\r\ncurrently receives the most contracts in their industry, whether it is in the commercial aircraft\r\nsegment of their business, or the military segment of their business. Furthermore, Boeing\r\nhas surpassed its earnings estimates for the most recent quarter (ending March 31, 2007)\r\nby a whopping 27%. Orders are pouring into the company on an almost daily basis.

INTRODUCTION\nWith the rapid expansion of e-commerce, more and more products are sold on the Web, and more and more people are also buying products online. In order to enhance customer satisfaction and shopping experience, it has become a common practice for online merchants to enable their customers to review or to express opinions on the products that they have purchased. With more and more common users becoming comfortable with the Web, an increasing number of people are writing reviews. As a result, the number of reviews that a product receives grows rapidly. Some popular products can get hundreds of reviews at some large merchant sites. Furthermore, many reviews are long and have only a few sentences containing opinions on the product. This makes it hard for a potential customer to read them to make an informed decision on whether to purchase the product. If he/she only reads a few reviews, he/she may get a biased view. The large number of reviews also makes it hard for product manufacturers to keep track of customer opinions of their products. For a product manufacturer, there are additional difficulties because many merchant sites may sell its products, and the manufacturer may (almost always) produce many kinds of products. In this research, we study the problem of generating feature-based summaries of customer reviews of products sold online. Here, features broadly mean product features (or attributes) and functions. Given a set of customer reviews of a particular product, the task involves three subtasks: (1) identifying features of the product that customers have expressed their opinions on (called product features); (2) for each feature, identifying review sentences that give positive or negative opinions; and (3) producing a summary using the discovered information. Let us use an example to illustrate a feature-based summary. Assume that we summarize the reviews of a particular digital camera, digital_camera_1. The summary looks like the following:\n\nDigital_camera_1:\n Feature: **picture quality**\n Positive: 253\n <individual review sentences>\n Negative: 6\n <individual review sentences>\n Feature: **size**\n Positive: 134\n <individual review sentences>\n Negative: 10\n <individual review sentences>\n \u2026\n**Figure 1: An example summary**\n\nIn Figure 1, picture quality and (camera) size are the product features. There are 253 customer reviews that express positive opinions about the picture quality, and only 6 that express negative opinions. The <individual review sentences> link points to the specific sentences and/or the whole reviews that give positive or negative comments about the feature. With such a feature-based summary, a potential customer can easily see how the existing customers feel about the digital camera. If he/she is very interested in a particular feature, he/she can drill down by following the <individual review sentences> link to see why existing customers like it and/or what they complain about. For a manufacturer, it is possible to combine summaries from multiple merchant sites to produce a single report for each of its products. Our task is different from traditional text summarization in a number of ways. First of all, a summary in our case is structured rather than another (but shorter) free text document as produced by most text summarization systems. Second, we are only interested in features of the product that customers have opinions on and also whether the opinions are positive or negative. We do not summarize the reviews by selecting or rewriting a subset of the original sentences from the reviews to capture their main points as in traditional text summarization. As indicated above, our task is performed in three main steps:\n(1) Mining product features that have been commented on by customers. We make use of both data mining and natural language processing techniques to perform this task. For completeness, we will summarize its techniques in this paper and also present a comparative evaluation.\n(2) Identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative. Note that these opinion sentences must contain one or more product features identified above. To decide the opinion orientation of each sentence (whether the opinion expressed in the sentence is positive or negative), we perform three subtasks. First, a set of adjective words (which are normally used to express opinions) is identified using a natural language processing method. These words are also called opinion words in this paper. Second, for each opinion word, we determine its semantic orientation, e.g., positive or negative. A bootstrapping technique is proposed to perform this task using WordNet. Finally, we decide the opinion orientation of each sentence. An effective algorithm is also given for this purpose.\n(3) Summarizing the results. This step aggregates the results of previous steps and presents them in the format of Figure 1.\n\n2. RELATED WORK\nExisting text summarization techniques mainly fall in one of the two categories: template instantiation and passage extraction. Work in the former framework emphasizes on identification and extraction of certain core entities and facts in a document, which are packaged in a template. This framework requires background knowledge in order to instantiate a template to a suitable level of detail. Therefore, it is not domain or genre independent. This is different from our work as our techniques do not fill any template and are domain independent. The passage extraction framework identifies certain segments of the text (typically sentences) that are the most representative of the document\u2019s content. Our work is different in that we do not extract representative sentences, but identify and extract those specific product features and the opinions related to\nthem. Boguraev and Kennedy propose to find a few very prominent expressions, objects or events in a document and use them to help summarize the document. Our work is again different as we find all product features in a set of customer reviews regardless whether they are prominent or not. Thus, our summary is not a traditional text summary. Most existing works on text summarization focus on a single document. Some researchers also studied summarization of multiple documents covering similar information. Their main purpose is to summarize the similarities and differences in the information content among these documents. Our work is related but quite different because we aim to find the key features that are talked about in multiple reviews. We do not summarize similarities and differences of reviews.\n\nIn terminology finding, there are basically two techniques for discovering terms in corpora: symbolic approaches that rely on syntactic description of terms, namely noun phrases, and statistical approaches that exploit the fact that the words composing a term tend to be found close to each other and reoccurring. However, using noun phrases tends to produce too many non-terms (low precision), while using reoccurring phrases misses many low frequency terms, terms with variations, and terms with only one word. Our association mining based technique does not have these problems, and we can also find infrequent features by exploiting the fact that we are only interested in features that the users have expressed opinions on.\n\n3. THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUES\nThe inputs to the system are a product name and an entry Web page for all the reviews of the product. The output is the summary of the reviews as the one shown in the introduction section. The system performs the summarization in three main steps (as discussed before): (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. These steps are performed in multiple sub-steps. Given the inputs, the system first downloads (or crawls) all the reviews, and put them in the review database. It then finds those \u201chot\u201d (or frequent) features that many people have expressed their opinions on. After that, the opinion words are extracted using the resulting frequent features, and semantic orientations of the opinion words are identified with the help of WordNet. Using the extracted opinion words, the system then finds those infrequent features. In the last two steps, the orientation of each opinion sentence is identified and a final summary is produced. Note that POS tagging is the part-of-speech tagging from natural language processing, which helps us to find opinion features.\n\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nOur experimental results indicate that the proposed techniques are very promising in performing their tasks. We believe that this problem will become increasingly important as more people are buying and expressing their opinions on the Web. Summarizing the reviews is not only useful to common shoppers, but also crucial to product manufacturers. In our future work, we plan to further improve and refine our techniques, and to deal with the outstanding problems identified above, i.e., pronoun resolution, determining the strength of opinions, and investigating opinions expressed with adverbs, verbs and nouns. Finally, we will also look into monitoring of\ncustomer reviews. We believe that monitoring will be particularly useful to product manufacturers because they want to know any new positive or negative comments on their products whenever they are available. The keyword here is new. Although a new review may be added, it may not contain any new information.", "full_prompt": "{Question}\n==================\nHow can review mining ensure it represents low-frequency terms in customer reviews?\n----------------\n{System Instruction}\n==================\nAnswer this question in one concise paragraph.

This step aggregates the results of previous steps and presents them in the format of Figure 1.\n\n2. RELATED WORK\nExisting text summarization techniques mainly fall in one of the two categories: template instantiation and passage extraction. Work in the former framework emphasizes on identification and extraction of certain core entities and facts in a document, which are packaged in a template. This framework requires background knowledge in order to instantiate a template to a suitable level of detail. Therefore, it is not domain or genre independent. This is different from our work as our techniques do not fill any template and are domain independent. The passage extraction framework identifies certain segments of the text (typically sentences) that are the most representative of the document\u2019s content. Our work is different in that we do not extract representative sentences, but identify and extract those specific product features and the opinions related to\nthem. Boguraev and Kennedy propose to find a few very prominent expressions, objects or events in a document and use them to help summarize the document. Our work is again different as we find all product features in a set of customer reviews regardless whether they are prominent or not. Thus, our summary is not a traditional text summary. Most existing works on text summarization focus on a single document. Some researchers also studied summarization of multiple documents covering similar information. Their main purpose is to summarize the similarities and differences in the information content among these documents. Our work is related but quite different because we aim to find the key features that are talked about in multiple reviews. We do not summarize similarities and differences of reviews.\n\nIn terminology finding, there are basically two techniques for discovering terms in corpora: symbolic approaches that rely on syntactic description of terms, namely noun phrases, and statistical approaches that exploit the fact that the words composing a term tend to be found close to each other and reoccurring. However, using noun phrases tends to produce too many non-terms (low precision), while using reoccurring phrases misses many low frequency terms, terms with variations, and terms with only one word. Our association mining based technique does not have these problems, and we can also find infrequent features by exploiting the fact that we are only interested in features that the users have expressed opinions on.\n\n3. THE PROPOSED TECHNIQUES\nThe inputs to the system are a product name and an entry Web page for all the reviews of the product. The output is the summary of the reviews as the one shown in the introduction section. The system performs the summarization in three main steps (as discussed before): (1) mining product features that have been commented on by customers; (2) identifying opinion sentences in each review and deciding whether each opinion sentence is positive or negative; (3) summarizing the results. These steps are performed in multiple sub-steps. Given the inputs, the system first downloads (or crawls) all the reviews, and put them in the review database. It then finds those \u201chot\u201d (or frequent) features that many people have expressed their opinions on. After that, the opinion words are extracted using the resulting frequent features, and semantic orientations of the opinion words are identified with the help of WordNet. Using the extracted opinion words, the system then finds those infrequent features. In the last two steps, the orientation of each opinion sentence is identified and a final summary is produced. Note that POS tagging is the part-of-speech tagging from natural language processing, which helps us to find opinion features.\n\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nOur experimental results indicate that the proposed techniques are very promising in performing their tasks. We believe that this problem will become increasingly important as more people are buying and expressing their opinions on the Web. Summarizing the reviews is not only useful to common shoppers, but also crucial to product manufacturers. In our future work, we plan to further improve and refine our techniques, and to deal with the outstanding problems identified above, i.e., pronoun resolution, determining the strength of opinions, and investigating opinions expressed with adverbs, verbs and nouns. Finally, we will also look into monitoring of\ncustomer reviews. We believe that monitoring will be particularly useful to product manufacturers because they want to know any new positive or negative comments on their products whenever they are available. The keyword here is new. Although a new review may be added, it may not contain any new information."}

Most of these productsplay crucial functions \u2018behind the scenes\u2019 in anumber of applications in everyday life. Theyusually offer superior performance that cannotbe replicated easily by other materials (Riedel,2013). Advanced ceramics today play a keyrole in technologies such as energy and theenvironment, transport, the life sciences, andcommunication and information technology(Greil, 2002). The terminology for defining this type ofceramics differs from continent to continent(Kulik, 1999). In the Japanese literature it\u2019snormally referred to as \u2018fine\u2019 ceramics, and inAmerican literature as \u2018advanced\u2019 or\u2018technical\u2019 ceramics (Kulik, 1999). In theEuropean context the term \u2018technical\u2019 ceramicsis more frequently used (Kulik, 1999). Afurther classification, depending on the use, iscommon in the UK, where the term \u2018technicalceramics\u2019 is further subdivided into functionalceramics to refer to electronic applications andstructural ceramics to refer mostly tomechanically loaded components (Kulik,1999).Advanced ceramics possess uniqueproperties that cannot be obtained inconventional materials, such as highrefractoriness and hardness, low density, lowcoefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), andhigher working temperatures (can maintaingood mechanical properties at hightemperatures). Moreover, there are reportswhich have proven that the cost of producingceramic materials is lower compared to metallicmaterials, and raw material reserves forceramics are abundant (Kulik, 1999).Resources for the production of metals andtheir alloys are dwindling, and thecontinuously increasing demand forengineering products requires alternativematerials to be identified. Over the past fewdecades advanced ceramics have made inroadsin a number of critical applications in everydaylife. It is noteworthy to mention here thatwithout sparkplugs made of alumina (Al2O3)ceramic, vehicle technology would not be soadvanced, moreover metallurgy would not beso reliable without refractories (Kulik, 1999).These are the hard facts behind commonplaceproducts that we normally take for granted.Although ceramics play a crucial role in anumber of technologies due to their uniquecombination of properties, it must be notedthat as structural materials they still face stiffcompetition from cheap metals, alloys, andcomposites (Kulik, 1999). Thus the majorbarriers to the broad application of advancedceramic materials include the lack ofspecifications and databases, high scale-upcosts, and lack of repair methods (Freitag andRicherson, 1998). However, over the years alot of progress has been made to alleviatethese deficiencies through new materialdiscoveries, improvements in properties, andimproved design methods (Freitag andRicherson, 1998).\n \n\n The term \u2019advanced ceramics\u2019 was coined in the 1970s todesignate a new category of engineering materials that wereto drive new technologies into the 21st century (Charreyron,2013). Since then there has been phenomenal growth in thetechnological advancement of these materials. A report fromResearch and Markets projected the advanced ceramicsmarket to reach US$10.4 billion by 2021, growing at acompounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5%(Charreyron, 2013). This growth is attributed to theincreasing use of advanced ceramic materials as alternativesto metals and plastics, with key drivers being the medical,electronics, and transport industries. The analog-to-digitalshift in consumer products has seen massive growth inelectronic device content in a number of applications. Forinstance, liquid crystal displays (LCDs) replaced cathode raytubes and DVDs replaced VHS tapes and players. Thisbasically points to significant growth for ceramic capacitorsand other ceramic electronic components. The largest share ofthe market has always been in the electronics industry,representing approximately more than 70% of production,but positive and negative shifts are expected according tochanges in demand (Kulik, 1999). Advanced ceramics are produced from three main classesof materials, namely oxides, carbides, and nitrides, with asmall quantity accounting for mixed compounds (WorldAdvanced Ceramics, 1966). Japan has been at the forefrontfor a number of years, owing partly to the high degree ofcooperation between companies in investigations anddevelopments (dynamic partnership) and high exportvolumes (Kulik, 1999; Charreyron, 2013). The major volumeof production in Japan is represented by electronic ceramics,accounting for up to 80% of total production (Kulik, 1999).The second largest producer of advanced ceramics is NorthAmerica, where the industry has been driven by massivegovernment financing of research and design development.The main difference between the two approaches is thatNorth America plays a leading role in technology andJapanese companies lead in the applications of advancedceramics. Such approaches have been successfully adopted bya number of European countries that now contributeextensively to the advanced technology market. One suchcountry is Germany, which is home to a number ofcompanies that compete for advanced technology projectsthroughout the world. \ue002\ue00e\ue008\ue011\ue00d\ue00f\ue010\ue00c\ue012\ue00b\ue00d\ue012\ue009\ue010\ue00c\ue010\ue011\ue009\ue00f\ue001\ue012\ue011\ue00d\ue00e\ue012\ue00e\ue010\ue008\ue010\ue005\ue00a\ue006\ue007\ue010\ue00d\ue003\ue012\ue00a\ue004\ue012\ue011\ue00e\ue008\ue011\ue00d\ue00f\ue010\ue00e\ue00f\ue010\ue009\ue011\ue007\ue00b\ue00f\ue00cOne of the most significant advances in ceramics research inthe past two decades has been improvements in fracturetoughness, especially for structural ceramics. On acomparative basis, glass has a fracture toughness of 1MPa.m0.5 and most conventional ceramics range from about2\u20133 MPa.m0.5; steel is about 40 MPa.m0.5 (Freitag andRicherson, 1998). Some advanced ceramics such astransformation toughened zirconia-ZrO2have toughness ofabout 15 MPa.m0.5, which is higher than that of tungsten-carbide cobalt (WC-Co) cermet and cast iron (Freitag andRicherson, 1998). This has dramatically improved theresistance to contact stress and handling damage, thusimparting high reliability and durability comparable to that ofmetals and WC-Co cermets (Freitag and Richerson, 1998).Prior to 1970, most ceramic materials had strengths wellbelow 345 MPa, but nowadays advanced ceramics such assilicon nitride (Si3N4) and toughened zirconia (ZrO2) arecommercially available with strengths above 690 MPa(Freitag and Richerson, 1998).The detailed mechanism of transformation tougheningcan be found elsewhere (Matizamhuka, 2016). However,what is important to note is that fracture toughness values 3\u20136 times higher than monolithic ZrO2ceramics have beenachieved by transformation toughening. Several othertechniques have been developed over the years to improvefracture toughness of advanced ceramics, such as the use ofmore ductile binders and reinforcement with fibres, whiskers,or second-phase particles. Details of such techniques can befound in the open literature (Matizamhuka, 2016).On the other hand, the high cost of ceramic componentshas been attributed to the lack of large-scale production withminimum losses in the production line. Ceramic-basedmaterials often compete against engineering materials withlower upfront costs, and it is often difficult to convincecustomers to pay a premium in exchange for performancebenefits (Charreyron, 2013). Design, process technology, andmachining technology still need to develop significantly toachieve cost-effective levels of high-volume production,consequently reducing the cost of components. A strategyused by previous market pioneers is that of forward pricingand continued government subsidies in anticipation of futuremarket growth. The recent phenomenal growth in theadvanced ceramics industry could easily translate into agreater market share in future, but this can happen only ifmajor breakthroughs are achieved in fundamental andapplied research (Liang and Dutta, 2001).", "full_prompt": "{instruction}\n ==========\n In your answer, refer only to the context document.

{"system_instruction": "Only use information from the context in your response. Focus on things someone can do without help from a professional.", "user_request": "How can I mitigate the risks of investing?", "context_document": "What about risk? \r\nAll investments involve taking on risk. It\u2019s important that you go into any investment in stocks, bonds or mutual funds with a full understanding that you could lose some or all of your money in any one investment. While over the long term the stock market has historically provided around 10% annual returns (closer to 6% or 7% \u201creal\u201d returns when you subtract for the effects of inflation), the long term does sometimes take a rather long, long time to play out. Those who invested all of their money in the stock market at its peak in 1929 (before the stock market crash) would wait over 20 years to see the stock market return to the same level. However, those that kept adding money to the market throughout that time would have done very well for themselves, as the lower cost of stocks in the 1930s made for some hefty gains for those who bought and held over the course of the next twenty years or more. It is often said that the greater the risk, the greater the potential reward in investing, but taking on unnecessary risk is often avoidable. Investors best protect themselves against risk by spreading their money among various investments, hoping that if one investment loses money, the other investments will more than make up for those losses. This strategy, called \u201cdiversification,\u201d can be neatly summed up as, \u201cDon\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket.\u201d Investors also protect themselves from the risk of investing all their money at the wrong time (think 1929) by following a consistent pattern of adding new money to their investments over long periods of time. Once you\u2019ve saved money for investing, consider carefully all your options and think about what diversification strategy makes sense for you. While the SEC cannot recommend any particular investment product, you should know that a vast array of investment products exists\u2014including stocks and stock mutual funds, corporate and municipal bonds, bond mutual funds, certificates of deposit, money market funds, and U.S. Treasury securities. Diversification can\u2019t guarantee that your investments won\u2019t suffer if the market drops. But it can improve the chances that you won\u2019t lose money, or that if you do, it won\u2019t be as much as if you weren\u2019t diversified. What are the best investments for me? The answer depends on when you will need the money, your goals, and if you will be able to sleep at night if you purchase a risky investment where you could lose your principal. For instance, if you are saving for retirement, and you have 35 years before you retire, you may want to consider riskier investment products, knowing that if you stick to only the \u201csavings\u201d products or to less risky investment products, your money will grow too slowly\u2014or, given inflation and taxes, you may lose the purchasing power of your money. A frequent mistake people make is putting money they will not need for a very long time in investments that pay a low amount of interest. On the other hand, if you are saving for a short-term goal, five years or less, you don\u2019t want to choose risky investments, because when it\u2019s time to sell, you may have to take a loss. Since investments often move up and down in value rapidly, you want to make sure that you can wait and sell at the best possible time.\r\nHow Can I Protect Myself? ASK QUESTIONS! \r\nYou can never ask a dumb question about your investments and the people who help you choose them, especially when it comes to how much you will be paying for any investment, both in upfront costs and ongoing management fees. Here are some questions you should ask when choosing an investment professional or someone to help you: \u2022 What training and experience do you have? How long have you been in business? \u2022 What is your investment philosophy? Do you take a lot of risks or are you more concerned about the safety of my money? \u2022 Describe your typical client. Can you provide me with references, the names of people who have invested with you for a long time? \u2022 How do you get paid? By commission? Based on a percentage of assets you manage? Another method? Do you get paid more for selling your own firm\u2019s products? \u2022 How much will it cost me in total to do business with you? Your investment professional should understand your investment goals, whether you\u2019re saving to buy a home, paying for your children\u2019s education, or enjoying a comfortable retirement. Your investment professional should also understand your tolerance for risk. That is, how much money can you afford to lose if the value of one of your investments declines? An investment professional has a duty to make sure that he or she only recommends investments that are suitable for you. That is, that the investment makes sense for you based on your other securities holdings, your financial situation, your means, and any other information that your investment professional thinks is important. The best investment professional is one who fully understands your objectives and matches investment recommendations to your goals. You\u2019ll want someone you can understand, because your investment professional should teach you about investing and the investment products. How Should I Monitor My Investments? Investing makes it possible for your money to work for you. In a sense, your money has become your employee, and that makes you the boss. You\u2019ll want to keep a close watch on how your employee, your money, is doing. Some people like to look at the stock quotations every day to see how their investments have done. That\u2019s probably too often. You may get too caught up in the ups and downs of the \u201ctrading\u201d value of your investment, and sell when its value goes down temporarily\u2014even though the performance of the company is still stellar. Remember, you\u2019re in for the long haul. Some people prefer to see how they\u2019re doing once a year. That\u2019s probably not often enough. What\u2019s best for you will most likely be somewhere in between, based on your goals and your investments. But it\u2019s not enough to simply check an investment\u2019s performance. You should compare that performance against an index of similar investments over the same period of time to see if you are getting the proper returns for the amount of risk that you are assuming. You should also compare the fees and commissions that you\u2019re paying to what other investment professionals charge. While you should monitor performance regularly, you should pay close attention every time you send your money somewhere else to work. Every time you buy or sell an investment you will receive a confirmation slip from your broker. Make sure each trade was completed according to your instructions. Make sure the buying or selling price was what your broker quoted. And make sure the commissions or fees are what your broker said they would be. Watch out for unauthorized trades in your account. If you get a confirmation slip for a transaction that you didn\u2019t approve beforehand, call your broker. It may have been a mistake. If your broker refuses to correct it, put your complaint in writing and send it to the firm\u2019s compliance officer. Serious complaints should always be made in writing. Remember, too, that if you rely on your investment professional for advice, he or she has an obligation to recommend investments that match your investment goals and tolerance for risk. Your investment professional should not be recommending trades simply to generate commissions. That\u2019s called \u201cchurning,\u201d and it\u2019s illegal. \r\nHow Can I Avoid Problems? \r\nChoosing someone to help you with your investments is one of the most important investment decisions you will ever make. While most investment professionals are honest and hardworking, you must watch out for those few unscrupulous individuals. They can make your life\u2019s savings disappear in an instant. Securities regulators and law enforcement officials can and do catch these criminals. But putting them in jail doesn\u2019t always get your money back. Too often, the money is gone. The good news is you can avoid potential problems by protecting yourself. Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve already met with several investment professionals based on recommendations from friends and others you trust, and you\u2019ve found someone who clearly understands your investment objectives. Before you hire this person, you still have more homework. Make sure the investment professional and her firm are registered with the SEC and licensed to do business in your state. And find out from your state\u2019s securities regulator whether the investment professional or her firm have ever been disciplined, or whether they have any complaints against them. You\u2019ll find contact information for securities regulators in the U.S. by visiting the website of the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) at www.nasaa.org or by calling (202) 737-0900. You should also find out as much as you can about any investments that your investment professional recommends. First, make sure the investments are registered. Keep in mind, however, the mere fact that a company has registered and files reports with the SEC doesn\u2019t guarantee that the company will be a good investment. Likewise, the fact that a company hasn\u2019t registered and doesn\u2019t file reports with the SEC doesn\u2019t mean the company is a fraud. Still, you may be asking for serious losses if, for instance, you invest in a small, thinly traded company that isn\u2019t widely known solely on the basis of what you may have read online. One simple phone call to your state regulator could prevent you from squandering your money on a scam. Be wary of promises of quick profits, offers to share \u201cinside information,\u201d and pressure to invest before you have an opportunity to investigate. These are all warning signs of fraud. Ask your investment professional for written materials and prospectuses, and read them before you invest. If you have questions, now is the time to ask.\u2022 How will the investment make money? \u2022 How is this investment consistent with my investment goals? \u2022 What must happen for the investment to increase in value? \u2022 What are the risks? \u2022 Where can I get more information? Finally, it\u2019s always a good idea to write down everything your investment professional tells you. Accurate notes will come in handy if ever there\u2019s a problem. Some investments make money. Others lose money. That\u2019s natural, and that\u2019s why you need a diversified portfolio to minimize your risk. But if you lose money because you\u2019ve been cheated, that\u2019s not natural, that\u2019s a problem. Sometimes all it takes is a simple phone call to your investment professional to resolve a problem. Maybe there was an honest mistake that can be corrected. If talking to the investment professional doesn\u2019t resolve the problem, talk to the firm\u2019s manager, and write a letter to confirm your conversation. If that doesn\u2019t lead to a resolution, you may have to initiate private legal action. You may need to take action quickly because legal time limits for doing so vary. Your local bar association can provide referrals for attorneys who specialize in securities law. At the same time, call or write to us and let us know what the problem was. Investor complaints are very important to the SEC. You may think you\u2019re the only one experiencing a problem, but typically, you\u2019re not alone. Sometimes it takes only one investor\u2019s complaint to trigger an investigation that exposes a bad broker or an illegal scheme. Complaints can be filed online with us by going to www.sec.gov/complaint.shtml.", "full_prompt": "Only use information from the context in your response. Focus on things someone can do without help from a professional.\nHow can I mitigate the risks of investing?\nWhat about risk? \r\nAll investments involve taking on risk. It\u2019s important that you go into any investment in stocks, bonds or mutual funds with a full understanding that you could lose some or all of your money in any one investment. While over the long term the stock market has historically provided around 10% annual returns (closer to 6% or 7% \u201creal\u201d returns when you subtract for the effects of inflation), the long term does sometimes take a rather long, long time to play out. Those who invested all of their money in the stock market at its peak in 1929 (before the stock market crash) would wait over 20 years to see the stock market return to the same level. However, those that kept adding money to the market throughout that time would have done very well for themselves, as the lower cost of stocks in the 1930s made for some hefty gains for those who bought and held over the course of the next twenty years or more. It is often said that the greater the risk, the greater the potential reward in investing, but taking on unnecessary risk is often avoidable. Investors best protect themselves against risk by spreading their money among various investments, hoping that if one investment loses money, the other investments will more than make up for those losses. This strategy, called \u201cdiversification,\u201d can be neatly summed up as, \u201cDon\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket.\u201d Investors also protect themselves from the risk of investing all their money at the wrong time (think 1929) by following a consistent pattern of adding new money to their investments over long periods of time. Once you\u2019ve saved money for investing, consider carefully all your options and think about what diversification strategy makes sense for you. While the SEC cannot recommend any particular investment product, you should know that a vast array of investment products exists\u2014including stocks and stock mutual funds, corporate and municipal bonds, bond mutual funds, certificates of deposit, money market funds, and U.S. Treasury securities. Diversification can\u2019t guarantee that your investments won\u2019t suffer if the market drops. But it can improve the chances that you won\u2019t lose money, or that if you do, it won\u2019t be as much as if you weren\u2019t diversified. What are the best investments for me? The answer depends on when you will need the money, your goals, and if you will be able to sleep at night if you purchase a risky investment where you could lose your principal. For instance, if you are saving for retirement, and you have 35 years before you retire, you may want to consider riskier investment products, knowing that if you stick to only the \u201csavings\u201d products or to less risky investment products, your money will grow too slowly\u2014or, given inflation and taxes, you may lose the purchasing power of your money. A frequent mistake people make is putting money they will not need for a very long time in investments that pay a low amount of interest. On the other hand, if you are saving for a short-term goal, five years or less, you don\u2019t want to choose risky investments, because when it\u2019s time to sell, you may have to take a loss. Since investments often move up and down in value rapidly, you want to make sure that you can wait and sell at the best possible time.\r\nHow Can I Protect Myself? ASK QUESTIONS! \r\nYou can never ask a dumb question about your investments and the people who help you choose them, especially when it comes to how much you will be paying for any investment, both in upfront costs and ongoing management fees. Here are some questions you should ask when choosing an investment professional or someone to help you: \u2022 What training and experience do you have? How long have you been in business? \u2022 What is your investment philosophy? Do you take a lot of risks or are you more concerned about the safety of my money? \u2022 Describe your typical client. Can you provide me with references, the names of people who have invested with you for a long time? \u2022 How do you get paid? By commission? Based on a percentage of assets you manage? Another method? Do you get paid more for selling your own firm\u2019s products? \u2022 How much will it cost me in total to do business with you? Your investment professional should understand your investment goals, whether you\u2019re saving to buy a home, paying for your children\u2019s education, or enjoying a comfortable retirement. Your investment professional should also understand your tolerance for risk. That is, how much money can you afford to lose if the value of one of your investments declines? An investment professional has a duty to make sure that he or she only recommends investments that are suitable for you. That is, that the investment makes sense for you based on your other securities holdings, your financial situation, your means, and any other information that your investment professional thinks is important. The best investment professional is one who fully understands your objectives and matches investment recommendations to your goals. You\u2019ll want someone you can understand, because your investment professional should teach you about investing and the investment products. How Should I Monitor My Investments? Investing makes it possible for your money to work for you. In a sense, your money has become your employee, and that makes you the boss. You\u2019ll want to keep a close watch on how your employee, your money, is doing. Some people like to look at the stock quotations every day to see how their investments have done. That\u2019s probably too often. You may get too caught up in the ups and downs of the \u201ctrading\u201d value of your investment, and sell when its value goes down temporarily\u2014even though the performance of the company is still stellar. Remember, you\u2019re in for the long haul. Some people prefer to see how they\u2019re doing once a year. That\u2019s probably not often enough. What\u2019s best for you will most likely be somewhere in between, based on your goals and your investments. But it\u2019s not enough to simply check an investment\u2019s performance. You should compare that performance against an index of similar investments over the same period of time to see if you are getting the proper returns for the amount of risk that you are assuming. You should also compare the fees and commissions that you\u2019re paying to what other investment professionals charge. While you should monitor performance regularly, you should pay close attention every time you send your money somewhere else to work. Every time you buy or sell an investment you will receive a confirmation slip from your broker. Make sure each trade was completed according to your instructions. Make sure the buying or selling price was what your broker quoted. And make sure the commissions or fees are what your broker said they would be. Watch out for unauthorized trades in your account. If you get a confirmation slip for a transaction that you didn\u2019t approve beforehand, call your broker. It may have been a mistake. If your broker refuses to correct it, put your complaint in writing and send it to the firm\u2019s compliance officer. Serious complaints should always be made in writing. Remember, too, that if you rely on your investment professional for advice, he or she has an obligation to recommend investments that match your investment goals and tolerance for risk. Your investment professional should not be recommending trades simply to generate commissions. That\u2019s called \u201cchurning,\u201d and it\u2019s illegal. \r\nHow Can I Avoid Problems? \r\nChoosing someone to help you with your investments is one of the most important investment decisions you will ever make. While most investment professionals are honest and hardworking, you must watch out for those few unscrupulous individuals. They can make your life\u2019s savings disappear in an instant. Securities regulators and law enforcement officials can and do catch these criminals. But putting them in jail doesn\u2019t always get your money back. Too often, the money is gone. The good news is you can avoid potential problems by protecting yourself. Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve already met with several investment professionals based on recommendations from friends and others you trust, and you\u2019ve found someone who clearly understands your investment objectives. Before you hire this person, you still have more homework. Make sure the investment professional and her firm are registered with the SEC and licensed to do business in your state. And find out from your state\u2019s securities regulator whether the investment professional or her firm have ever been disciplined, or whether they have any complaints against them. You\u2019ll find contact information for securities regulators in the U.S. by visiting the website of the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) at www.nasaa.org or by calling (202) 737-0900. You should also find out as much as you can about any investments that your investment professional recommends. First, make sure the investments are registered. Keep in mind, however, the mere fact that a company has registered and files reports with the SEC doesn\u2019t guarantee that the company will be a good investment. Likewise, the fact that a company hasn\u2019t registered and doesn\u2019t file reports with the SEC doesn\u2019t mean the company is a fraud. Still, you may be asking for serious losses if, for instance, you invest in a small, thinly traded company that isn\u2019t widely known solely on the basis of what you may have read online. One simple phone call to your state regulator could prevent you from squandering your money on a scam. Be wary of promises of quick profits, offers to share \u201cinside information,\u201d and pressure to invest before you have an opportunity to investigate. These are all warning signs of fraud. Ask your investment professional for written materials and prospectuses, and read them before you invest. If you have questions, now is the time to ask.\u2022 How will the investment make money? \u2022 How is this investment consistent with my investment goals? \u2022 What must happen for the investment to increase in value? \u2022 What are the risks? \u2022 Where can I get more information? Finally, it\u2019s always a good idea to write down everything your investment professional tells you. Accurate notes will come in handy if ever there\u2019s a problem. Some investments make money. Others lose money. That\u2019s natural, and that\u2019s why you need a diversified portfolio to minimize your risk. But if you lose money because you\u2019ve been cheated, that\u2019s not natural, that\u2019s a problem. Sometimes all it takes is a simple phone call to your investment professional to resolve a problem. Maybe there was an honest mistake that can be corrected. If talking to the investment professional doesn\u2019t resolve the problem, talk to the firm\u2019s manager, and write a letter to confirm your conversation.

What are the differences between their loan approval processes?", "context_document": "Over 93% of Americans have some type of financial transactional account, including checking, savings, money market, and call accounts. However, despite desiring a variety of choices in order to make informed decisions for their families and businesses, most Americans choose large national and regional banking institutions for their financial needs. In fact, big banks account for 74.8% of the total financial account market while smaller banking institutions and credit unions account for only 18.2% and 7%, respectively.\n \n\n Why the disparity? Although credit unions have been providing financial services in the U.S. for over 100 years, many people simply don\u2019t know how they differ from a typical bank. The popularity of credit unions exploded in the first half of the 20th century and especially during the Great Depression. During this time, consumer credit from banking institutions was tight, leading many Americans to demand alternative banking choices. Credit unions were more likely to approve \u201crisky\u201d loans and provide services to people with less-than-perfect credit. Credit unions gained so much popularity that President Franklin Roosevelt enacted the Federal Credit Union Act in 1934, which established the National Credit Union Administration (\u201cNCUA\u201d) in order to better regulate federal credit unions and insure money deposited into credit union accounts.\n \n\n Credit unions and banks have a variety of major and minor differences, which boil down to business structure, product offerings, customer service, and membership requirements. These differences may be viewed as advantages or drawbacks, depending on your financial needs and preferences.\n \n\n One of the most important and major differences between banks and credit unions is business structure. A bank \u2013 whether it\u2019s a small local provider or a national chain \u2013 is a for-profit enterprise. Similar to any other for-profit business, banks want to increase sales while reducing costs. If a bank is a public company, it\u2019s governed by a board of directors and sells shares of its stock to investors.\n \n\n Conversely, credit unions are member-owned not-for-profit cooperatives. Specifically, if you open any type of account at a credit union, you\u2019re considered a part-owner of that union. As such, credit union members enjoy certain benefits such as the ability to elect a volunteer board in charge of making important decisions on services, fees, and overall credit union management. Members also benefit from profit sharing in the form of reduced fees and dividends. As a result, credit unions typically consist of small, independent businesses or local chains.\n \n\n When it comes to customer service, credit unions outrank other financial institutions. According to the most recent annual American Customer Satisfaction Index (\u201cACSI\u201d) report, credit unions scored an 85 for customer satisfaction, while the average bank scored a 76. The ACSI measured a variety of factors, including expectations, quality, value, loyalty, and complaint rates. Credit unions have outscored banks on all major factors for seven consecutive years.\n \n\n What makes credit unions so customer friendly? The reasons relate not only to their lower product rates and fees, but also to how they operate. As small not-for-profit cooperatives serving the local community, credit unions are more likely to work with people with poor or no credit that have been turned down by larger banks to obtain loans. Furthermore, some credit unions that serve low-income populations quality for the NCUA low-income designation, which entitles them and their members to additional benefits. In addition, credit unions work toward the betterment of their members and the surrounding community by offering a variety of local supports, such as sponsoring neighborhood or town projects, offering personal finance classes, providing microloans to people or businesses that don\u2019t qualify for more traditional loans, and even offering scholarships and grants for local students.\n \n\n Similar to shopping at a large national big-box retailer versus a small mom-and-pop store, banks and credit unions provide similar financial benefits \u2013 but the products and types of services can be significantly different. Banks, especially large, national chains, generally provide more products \u2013 such as a variety of checking and saving account types, CDs, IRAs, and even credit cards. The variety allows individuals and businesses to find what works best for them.\n \n\n Credit unions, on the other hand, don\u2019t always have the resources to offer the product variety that a larger bank could. However, as they are not-for-profit organizations, credit unions are able to offer lower fees and higher interest rates on the products they do carry as compared to a traditional bank.\n \n\n In addition to fewer product offerings, credit unions typically do not offer the same amenities as banks. With advanced online and mobile banking options, remote check deposits, and ubiquitous branches and ATMs \u2013 there\u2019s a reason why banks control 93% of the financial account market. Quite simply, banks have the resources and economy of scale to invest in state-of-the-art, convenient services that customers want.\n \n\n Conversely, as credit unions are dedicated to serving a small, local population, there are typically only a few branches. Most credit unions do not maintain the capital to invest in cutting-edge services, and typically only offer rudimentary online banking options. However, although individual credit unions do not maintain a large number of branches, many credit unions belong to larger cooperatives that share resources, such as ATMs. This is especially important for today\u2019s banking customer that requires on-the-go convenience and access to free ATMs.\n \n\n Lastly, a major difference between credit unions and banks is membership requirements. As mentioned, credit unions are member-owned and operated cooperatives, while banks are either private or public business enterprises. Banks are open to the public, and are free to do business with whomever they want. Credit unions, on the other hand, are required by law to restrict membership to certain communities tied by a \u201cmembership field\u201d based on common occupations or association membership, family ties, or location. Most credit unions base their membership on locality, such as a town or region, while others may only serve certain professions, such as teachers or those in law enforcement.\n \n\n The NCUA changed its field of membership regulations in 2003 in order to increase credit union membership. The new rules expand what constitutes an occupational common bond as well as a community. The new regulations also eliminated several mandatory factors determining common bonds and membership fields. This has allowed credit unions that were once relatively inaccessible to open their doors to more types of consumers.\n \n\n Credit unions are enjoying increased interest in the wake of the recession and amidst consumer backlash against \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks. In 2011, a grassroots movement capitalized on feelings of consumer unrest by promoting Bank Transfer Day, urging Americans to move their accounts from big, national banks to community banks or credit unions. While over 600,000 people reportedly made the switch on Bank Transfer Day, the much-publicized movement continued to gain momentum. Approximately 5.6 million people moved their bank accounts in the fourth quarter of 2011, of which 11% was attributed to the Bank Transfer Day movement. Since that time, interest in credit unions has continued to gain momentum. Credit union membership increased 3.5% in 2015, the fastest annual advance since 1994.\n \n\n As with any decision, there are advantages and disadvantages to choosing either institution for your financial needs; it\u2019s important to consider your needs, lifestyle, and goals. For example, an individual running a small consulting firm who regularly travels internationally may opt for a large bank due to its plethora of technology amenities and international presence. Conversely, the owner of a local shop may choose a credit union, preferring to support another local business and who appreciates the no frill, hands-on customer service.", "full_prompt": "Answer the question based solely on the information provided in the passage.

The two-dimensional diagram (Fig 3) reveals a clear division of the lipidomic data set into three distinct groups, corresponding to L3-egg, L3-lung and the intestinal stages (i.e. L4, Af and Am). Interestingly, limited variation in lipid amount was observed among adult stages. Of all five developmental stages/sexes, the largest amount of total lipids was measured in third-stage larvae (i.e. L3-egg and L3-lung) (Fig 4A). The semi-quantitative analysis revealed that third-stage larvae (i.e. L3-egg and L3-lung) contained > 150 and 100 \u03bcM/mg (micromole of lipids per milligram of dry worm body weight), respectively, whereas \u2264 35 \u03bcM/mg were measured in other developmental stages/sexes (i.e. L4, Af and Am) (Fig 4A).\n As expected, lipid categories GP (n = 155 to 253) and GL (n = 44 to 109), for which a large number of lipids species were identified (Table 1), contributed predominantly to the lipid abundance in A. suum across five key developmental stages/sexes (Fig 5 and S1 Fig). The overall GP abundance reached a peak in third-stage larvae (i.e. L3-egg and L3-lung), was significantly lower in later developmental stages/sexes (i.e. L4, Af and Am). Membrane structure-related lipid classes, such as PC, PE and PI, contributed significantly to a low overall GP abundance (Fig 6 and S2 Fig). Individual PC, PE and PI lipid species, such as PC (36:3), PE (O-36:1) and PI (38:4), which contained even-numbered fatty acyl chains (e.g., 18:0, 18:1 or 18:2) predominated in the third-stage larvae (S3 Table). Additionally, LPC, LPE, LPG and LPS classes peaked in L3-lung, and then were substantially reduced during the migration from lung (i.e. L3-lung) to the small intestine (i.e. L4, Af and Am) (S2 Fig). Within the GL category, a significantly higher abundance of TG was measured in L3-egg compared with all other stages/sexes studied (Fig 6). Notably, TG exhibited a slightly higher level in Af than in Am. Deeper analysis of individual lipid species showed that TG lipids with C18 fatty acyl chains (e.g. 18:0, 18:1, 18:2 and 18:3) predominated and that many of these lipids (n = 9) showed a high abundance (> 1 \u03bcM/mg) for the TG class (S3 Table). Nevertheless, a significantly higher level of total saturated lipid was observed in L3-lung, whereas high levels of ether-linked lipid were detected in the L3-egg and L3-lung (Fig 7). All lipid classes and individual lipid species as well as their differences in abundance among developmental stages/sexes are given in S2\u2013S4 Figs and S3 Table.\n The two-dimensional PCA showed that lipidomic data of organ systems for male adult Ascaris (i.e. MRT, MAT and MBW) and the body wall from the female worm (i.e. FBW) clustered tightly together, to the exclusion of the reproductive and alimentary tracts of female Ascaris (i.e. FRT and FAT) (Fig 8). Semi-quantitative analysis of the organ systems showed an enrichment of total lipids in the reproductive and alimentary tracts of adult Ascaris (Fig 4B). FRT (141 \u03bcM/mg) had > 4 times more lipid overall as compared with MBW (32 \u03bcM/mg). Except for the reproductive tract, a comparisons of the same organ system between the sexes showed that the female worm had more total lipids than the male. Similar to the developmental lipidome, GP (ranged 27\u2013134 \u03bcM/mg) and GL (ranged 3\u201349 \u03bcM/mg) were the two most abundant lipid categories in A. suum at an organ system level, whereas only small amounts (range: 1\u201311 \u03bcM/mg) of lipids of the SP category were detected (Fig 5 and S1 Fig).\n Regarding the reproductive tract, the overall GP abundance was significantly higher in male (134 \u03bcM/mg) than in female (69 \u03bcM/mg) (Fig 5B). In contrast, GL abundance showed the opposite trend, with significantly higher levels in FRT (49 \u03bcM/mg) than in MRT (3 \u03bcM/mg) (Fig 5D). A deeper analysis of the lipidomic data set according to organ system revealed differences primarily in the lipids in the PC, PE and TG classes, characterised by a higher abundance of individual PC species (e.g. PC (16:0_20:4), PC (18:0e_20:2), PC (18:1_20:2) and PC (20:1_18:2)) and PE species (e.g. PE (O-18:0_18:1), PE (O-18:0_20:1)) in FRT compared with MRT; and a higher abundance of TG species, such as TG (17:0_18:2_6:0), TG (18:0_18:1_18:2) and TG (18:1_18:1_6:0), in MRT (S3 Table).\n In the alimentary tract, the total GL amount was more abundant in female (36 \u03bcM/mg) than in male (3 \u03bcM/mg), whereas the overall GP in the alimentary tract was at a comparable level (nearly 60 \u03bcM/mg) in female and male. Notably, individual TG species with even-numbered fatty acyl chains, such as TG (16:0_16:1_18:1), TG (16:1_18:1_18:2) and TG (18:0_18:1_18:2), differed markedly in abundance between FAT and MAT. There was no significant difference in the abundance of overall GP and GL in the body wall. Subsequent analyses revealed that both saturated and either-linked lipids were highly abundant in the reproductive and alimentary tracts of both female and male worms, with no significant difference between the sexes.

{"system_instruction": "Draw your answer only from the text below.", "user_request": "Please describe modifications to insulin that have resulted in improvements in safety, effectiveness, and convenience to patients. Please describe just one modification that pertains to the three areas listed above.", "context_document": "Insulin is a small protein composed of 51 amino acids. Because insulin is derived from a living organism, it is considered a biologic, or biological product (the text box below defines biologics and describes their regulatory framework). Since the discovery of insulin, incremental modifications over time have resulted in improvements in safety, effectiveness, and convenience to patients.5\n\nInsulin was discovered in 1921 by two University of Toronto researchers who sold their U.S. patents to the university for $1 each, so the drug could be produced at a reasonable cost.6 Facing challenges manufacturing sufficient quantities of insulin for the North American market, in 1923, the University of Toronto team partnered with\u2014and licensed manufacturing rights to\u2014several pharmaceutical companies.7 \n\nCommercially available insulins today differ from the insulin discovered by the Toronto team. The original insulin was a short-acting product with a duration of action of 6-8 hours, making it less suitable for providing 24-hour coverage. In the late 1930s through the 1950s, researchers altered regular insulin by adding substances (e.g., protamine and zinc) to gain longer action, resulting in what are now called intermediate-acting insulins. One such advance, Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH), was patented in 1946.

In the late 1980s, advancements in recombinant technology allowed scientists to modify insulin\u2019s structure to improve its physiological effects. This advancement resulted in the development of insulin analogs, which more closely replicate normal insulin patterns in the body. In 1996, Humalog (insulin lispro) became the first rapid-acting insulin analog to be approved, followed by Novolog (insulin aspart) in 2000, and others thereafter.10 This same technology allowed for the development of long-acting insulin analogs.

Subsequent patenting of these modifications upon approval has shielded insulin products from competition for extended periods.

Please describe just one modification that pertains to the three areas listed above.\n\nInsulin is a small protein composed of 51 amino acids. Because insulin is derived from a living organism, it is considered a biologic, or biological product (the text box below defines biologics and describes their regulatory framework). Since the discovery of insulin, incremental modifications over time have resulted in improvements in safety, effectiveness, and convenience to patients.5\n\nInsulin was discovered in 1921 by two University of Toronto researchers who sold their U.S. patents to the university for $1 each, so the drug could be produced at a reasonable cost.6 Facing challenges manufacturing sufficient quantities of insulin for the North American market, in 1923, the University of Toronto team partnered with\u2014and licensed manufacturing rights to\u2014several pharmaceutical companies.7 \n\nCommercially available insulins today differ from the insulin discovered by the Toronto team. The original insulin was a short-acting product with a duration of action of 6-8 hours, making it less suitable for providing 24-hour coverage. In the late 1930s through the 1950s, researchers altered regular insulin by adding substances (e.g., protamine and zinc) to gain longer action, resulting in what are now called intermediate-acting insulins. One such advance, Neutral Protamine Hagedorn (NPH), was patented in 1946. It allowed for the combination of two types of insulin (long-acting and short-acting insulin) in premixed vials, making a single daily injection possible for some patients.8  \n\nAt that time, insulin was obtained by extraction from animals.

Their ability to convert previous knowledge and experiences into new solutions forms the base for organisations\u2019 operation. It is, in fact, what pure knowledge-intensive organisations are selling. Essential are not only the knowledge reserves of the workers, but also what they are able to do with them. (Drucker 1999, p. 84)  Characteristic to knowledge work is also the element of learning. For example a person working in product development has to be able to observe his research subject and to learn from it, as well as to be able to apply the things he learns into new products. To a certain point, also a knowledge worker\u2019s productivity can be increased by education, but above all, as Polanyi (1966) states it, most of the exploitable human capital is tacit in nature and is formed through experience rather than learned from books (according to Nonaka and Takeuchi 1995, pp. 59-61). Because human memory is limited, it is relevant that workers can share their information and knowledge with each other \u2013 learn themselves but also teach others (Drucker 1999, pp. 84).   Learning and the ability to create new things are also highlighted when the organisation\u2019s objective is to innovate. Organisation\u2019s innovativeness  can be defined as an ability to maintain existing success factors at the same time, when new solutions are made in order to ensure competitive advantage also in future (P\u00f6yh\u00f6nen 2004, St\u00e5hle et al. 2004, p. 13). The innovative potential is basically in the employees, but it can be brought about by different managerial actions. It requires at least an implication from the management that innovative behaviour is what is expected from the employee. Innovativeness appears as worker\u2019s ability to create new solutions and not just relying on existing practises and models.   On the other hand, sharing of information is important when we think about information used in work process. This includes not only information that is gathered from the customer but  6\r\nalso information, which already exists in the organisation but is not specifically \u201cowned\u201d by certain employee. Just as in manual work, waiting and searching for resources hinders productivity of a knowledge worker \u2013 their resources are only immaterial in nature and it might be more difficult to pay attention to the time used in looking for information. It often is a part of the work to look for adequate new information. However, it is not productive that employees should spend time looking for information that already exists but is too difficult to find. Although information systems are nowadays used by virtually all companies, and are therefore seen more as a tool instead of a resource, their importance in information sharing is undeniable. Especially important is the worker\u2019s ability to exploit them in their work and that information systems support the way an organisation answers to its customer\u2019s needs. (St\u00e5hle et al. 2004, p. 78) Information systems are, however, quite useless if the quality of information  they include is low \u2013 information is, for example, wrong or incomplete. Knowledge workers make decisions based on the information available, and if it is unsatisfactory, outcome of the process can be poor in quality or even totally unusable for the customer.  Information should not be shared only between the workers within organisation, but also with all interest groups. Organisational networks are a part of intellectual capital. An organisation can enforce some networks (customers, subcontractors, distributors, research partners etc.; Edvinsson and Malone 1997, p. 11) and provide its employees with sufficient means to attain information needed in their work. Insufficient networks can result in a deficit of information, which will evidently lead to inability to answer to customers\u2019 needs and loss of competitive advantage.  Although knowledge work is distinctively described as something, where the workers themselves decide, how they manage their tasks (Pepitone 2002 refers to the amount of discretion required), in every organization there are certain standards, routines and practices that have come about in the course of time. They are based on mental models that the members share, and often reflect the values, norms, beliefs and myths of the organisation (Juuti 2003 and Schein 1987 according to St\u00e5hle et al. 2004. p. 82). These standards can either support working or hinder it. Anyhow, they do exist and should not be neglected when examining productivity. Castells (2000) has argued, that standardisation of work processes intensifies also knowledge work especially when there is interaction between different actors of the process (see also McKenzie and van Winkelen 2004, p. 40). On the other hand both Jackson (1999) and Blom et al. (2001) have emphasised the ability of a knowledge-intensive organisation to utilise new practices to concentrate on allowing employees to determine their own approaches.  Time used in production is a rather complex input factor. Traditionally, productivity is seen increased if the output has been produced in shorter time period. This often happens also in knowledge work: when the workers learn how to do things and have more experience to which they can relate new problems they can perform similar tasks faster than before. However, there is a limit for how much time used can be decreased before the quality of work is eroded. In knowledge work, \u201cquality is the essence of the output\u201d (Drucker 1999, p. 84). Also, if a worker has too much time or too little work to do, his productivity can suffer. The key issue is to find the right balance.  Working environment and its effect on productivity has been researched rather extensively. It is also the area, where subjective productivity measurement has been mostly used. Lighting, air conditioning, cleaning, heating, noise controlling as well as office layouts are known to affect productivity (see for example Sepp\u00e4nen 2004 or Oseland and Bartlett 1999). Working environment at its worst prevents employees from doing their job and its best can contribute to innovative atmosphere (Davenport et al. 2002; St\u00e5hle et al. 2004, pp. 78-82) Working environment includes not only physical facilities but also the psychological atmosphere and the organisational culture. They can actually be even more important in knowledge work, as  7\r\nfor example acceptance of new ideas (Kanter 1987, p. 181), common language (DeSimone and Hatsopoulos 1995: Von Krogh 1998), values and goals (West 1990) as well as approval of different people and taking failures as part of innovative work are known to support innovative atmosphere in organisations (in St\u00e5hle et al. 2004, pp. 82-95).  But above all, even if the workers of knowledge-intensive organisation have all the other inputs described \u2013 human capital, knowledge and experiences, information systems, perfect working environment etc. \u2013 not much can be done with it, if they do not know what they are pursuing for. The clear aim of working is the essential for succeeding. As Drucker (1999, p. 84) puts it, the productivity assessment in knowledge work should always be based on the questions \u201cWhat is the worker\u2019s actual task?\u201d instead of \u201cHow should the work be done?\u201d.

What search terms should I use to identify the work mentioned in this text?", "context_document": "The emergence of foundation models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. These models, exemplified by their extensive training data and capacity for generalization, have dramatically expanded the horizons of computational linguistics, text understanding, and text generation [5, 10, 34\u201337]. However, a critical challenge faced by LLMs is their limited efficacy in executing complex reasoning tasks, particularly in areas requiring deep, abstract thought such as advanced mathematics [25]. This limitation points towards a need for enhanced methodologies that can augment LLMs\u2019 reasoning faculties.\nThe root of this challenge lies in the architecture of modern LLMs, which is predominantly oriented toward auto-regressive token prediction [5, 35, 36]. While efficient for a broad spectrum of tasks, this approach is\n\n \nnot meticulously designed to support the depth and sophistication of human-like analytical thinking. This discrepancy is highlighted by the dual-process theory of cognitive psychology, articulated by Kahneman [21], which differentiates the fast, intuitive responses of System 1 thinking from the slower, more deliberate reasoning of System 2 thinking. LLMs, in their typical operations, mirror System 1 processes and thus encounter difficulties with tasks that require the more deliberate, structured approach characteristic of System 2 thinking.\nAttempts to bridge this gap have led to the development of innovative methodologies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [44] and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) [28, 49], which guide LLMs in articulating intermediate steps in reasoning tasks. These methods, although valuable, have not fully realized the depth and flexibility of human cognitive processes in an abstract sense.\nIn response to these challenges, we introduce Meta Prompting (MP) and establish a theoretical framework for it, a novel approach that represents a substantial advance in the field of LLM reasoning. Meta Prompting extends beyond existing methods by abstracting and generalizing key principles for enhanced cognitive processing. Unlike its predecessors, Meta Prompting shifts the focus from content-driven reasoning to a more structure-oriented perspective. This method draws inspiration from category theory and type theory, establishing a functorial relationship between tasks and their corresponding prompts. This categorical approach allows for a more systematic and adaptable framework, capable of addressing a wide range of cognitive tasks with depth and nuance akin to human reasoning.\nFurthermore, a pivotal aspect of meta prompting is its application to Meta Prompting for prompting tasks in an in-context and recursive way utilizing the functorial and compositional properties of Meta Prompting, which we call Recursive Meta Prompting (RMP). This concept, akin to metaprogramming in programming language theory, involves using LLMs to design new prompts autonomously.

Information not in the source text should be disregarded.\n\nAny surnames used in your responses must be given in all capitals.\n\n\n\nThe emergence of foundation models, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence. These models, exemplified by their extensive training data and capacity for generalization, have dramatically expanded the horizons of computational linguistics, text understanding, and text generation [5, 10, 34\u201337]. However, a critical challenge faced by LLMs is their limited efficacy in executing complex reasoning tasks, particularly in areas requiring deep, abstract thought such as advanced mathematics [25]. This limitation points towards a need for enhanced methodologies that can augment LLMs\u2019 reasoning faculties.\nThe root of this challenge lies in the architecture of modern LLMs, which is predominantly oriented toward auto-regressive token prediction [5, 35, 36]. While efficient for a broad spectrum of tasks, this approach is\n\n \nnot meticulously designed to support the depth and sophistication of human-like analytical thinking. This discrepancy is highlighted by the dual-process theory of cognitive psychology, articulated by Kahneman [21], which differentiates the fast, intuitive responses of System 1 thinking from the slower, more deliberate reasoning of System 2 thinking. LLMs, in their typical operations, mirror System 1 processes and thus encounter difficulties with tasks that require the more deliberate, structured approach characteristic of System 2 thinking.\nAttempts to bridge this gap have led to the development of innovative methodologies such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) [44] and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) [28, 49], which guide LLMs in articulating intermediate steps in reasoning tasks. These methods, although valuable, have not fully realized the depth and flexibility of human cognitive processes in an abstract sense.\nIn response to these challenges, we introduce Meta Prompting (MP) and establish a theoretical framework for it, a novel approach that represents a substantial advance in the field of LLM reasoning. Meta Prompting extends beyond existing methods by abstracting and generalizing key principles for enhanced cognitive processing. Unlike its predecessors, Meta Prompting shifts the focus from content-driven reasoning to a more structure-oriented perspective. This method draws inspiration from category theory and type theory, establishing a functorial relationship between tasks and their corresponding prompts. This categorical approach allows for a more systematic and adaptable framework, capable of addressing a wide range of cognitive tasks with depth and nuance akin to human reasoning.\nFurthermore, a pivotal aspect of meta prompting is its application to Meta Prompting for prompting tasks in an in-context and recursive way utilizing the functorial and compositional properties of Meta Prompting, which we call Recursive Meta Prompting (RMP). This concept, akin to metaprogramming in programming language theory, involves using LLMs to design new prompts autonomously. The functorial nature of Meta Prompting allows for this advanced capability, where LLMs can not only solve problems but also generate the structures to solve them. This self-referential and recursive ability marks a significant leap in LLMs\u2019 autonomy and adaptability.\nThe practical efficacy of the Meta Prompting framework is empirically validated through a series of experiments, ranging from solving the Game of 24 puzzles [49] to addressing complex MATH problems [17], underscoring the Meta Prompting\u2019s versatility and empowering LLMs with advanced reasoning capabilities.\nIn summary, our contributions can be listed as follows:\n\u2022 We propose the structured and syntax-oriented Meta Prompting (MP), and introduce a theoretical framework for meta prompting based on category theory.

Not applicable to Linux infrastructures.\nNSA recommends Windows administrators install the latest security patches for their\nendpoints. Microsoft patches from May 2023 contain optional software mitigations to prevent\nrollback of the boot manager and kernel to versions vulnerable to Baton Drop and BlackLotus.\nThe optional mitigations \u2013 including a Code Integrity Boot Policy \u2013 should be enabled after the\norganization has updated its Windows installation, recovery, and diagnostic software to the\nlatest available versions.

Expertly administered and exposed\ninfrastructures only. Not recommended due to limited long-term effectiveness.\nBlackLotus relies upon older (pre-January 2022), signed Windows boot loader images to\nimplant a system. Secure Boot can be updated with DBX deny list hashes that prevent\nexecuting older and vulnerable boot loaders. Public reporting [5] provides indications as to\nwhich boot managers are observed exploited in the wild. In 2020, NSA published \"UEFI\nSecure Boot Customization\" to provide guidance on modifying Secure Boot. Adding DBX\nhashes qualifies as a partial customization action covered in section 4 \"Customization,\"\nstarting on page 7, and continuing through section 4.4.3 \u201cUpdate the DB or DBX.\u201d [6]\nAdditionally, a GitHub.com repository has been set up with some helpful scripts and guides to\naccomplish customization.

Microsoft provides updated install and\nrecovery images for Windows 11 and 10. Only update the DBX after acquiring install and\nrecovery media with the January 2022 or later patch assortment applied (e.g., version 22H1 or\nnewer).\nWarning: The following DBX hashes may be combined with the Secure Boot Customization\nsteps to revoke trust in select boot loaders vulnerable to Baton Drop. [6] However, more\nvulnerable boot loaders exist than the DBX can contain. BlackLotus developers can rapidly\nswitch to alternate vulnerable boot loaders to evade DBX customization.

The total number of Baton\nDrop-vulnerable boot loaders signed by the key associated with the Production CA\u2019s certificate\nis thought to exceed the available DBX memory. Removing the certificate negates the need to\nadd DBX entries related to Baton Drop and BlackLotus.

[6]\nDo not place the Windows Production CA 2011 certificate in the Machine Owner Key Exclusion\n(MOKX) list in lieu of removing it from the DB. Utilizing MOKX in this way will cause the\nrevoked certificate to still be trusted between firmware initialization and the initialization of\nShim\u2019s Secure Boot extensions.\nThe Windows Production CA 2011 certificate must be restored if converting the device from\nLinux to Windows. Microsoft provides the certificate for download via their resources for\nsystem manufacturers. [9]\n\nU/OO/167397-23 | PP-23-1628 | JUN 2023 Ver. 1.0\n\n4\n\n\fNSA | BlackLotus Mitigation Guide\n\nFrequently asked questions\n1. Is BlackLotus a firmware implant?\nNo. BlackLotus is boot software. The UEFI boot process involves several phases. Execution\ncontrol flow transitions from firmware to software following the Boot Device Select phase. [8]\n\n2. Can BlackLotus be removed or quarantined?\nYes, prior to execution. Devices that boot to a BlackLotus EFI binary will need to be completely\nreimaged. Attempts to remove BlackLotus following installation result in kernel errors.\n\n3. Does BlackLotus bypass Secure Boot?\nAn initial bypass is followed by poisoning that configures Secure Boot to trust the malware. An\nolder, vulnerable boot loader that is trusted by Secure Boot is necessary to strip the Secure\nBoot policy from being enforced so that BlackLotus can implant its entire software stack.\nSubsequent boots extend the Microsoft UEFI signing ecosystem with a malicious BlackLotus\ncertificate. Thus, Secure Boot will trust the malware.\n\n4. Which version of Windows is affected?\nBlackLotus targets Windows 11 and 10. Variants may exist to target older, UEFI-booting\nversions of Windows. Patches are available for Windows 8.1, 10, and 11.\n\n5. Is Linux affected? Is there a version of BlackLotus that targets Linux?\nNo, not that has been identified at this time. BlackLotus does incorporate some Linux boot\nbinaries, but the malware targets Windows OS software. No Linux-targeting variant has been\nobserved.\n\n6. Is BlackLotus really unstoppable?\nNo \u2013 BlackLotus is very stoppable on fully updated Windows endpoints, Secure Bootcustomized devices, or Linux endpoints. Microsoft has released patches and continues to\nharden mitigations against BlackLotus and Baton Drop. [1], [3], [4] The Linux community may\nremove the Microsoft Windows Production CA 2011 certificate on devices that exclusively boot\nLinux. Mitigation options available today will be reinforced by changes to vendor Secure Boot\ncertificates in the future (some certificates are expiring starting in 2026).\n\n7. Where can I find more public information?\nNSA is aware of several technically deep analysis reports posted online from security\nresearchers and vendors. One thorough source of public information is ESET Security\u2019s blog\nU/OO/167397-23 | PP-23-1628 | JUN 2023 Ver. 1.0\n\n5\n\n\fNSA | BlackLotus Mitigation Guide\n\nreferenced as [5] in this report. Another source of information is the Microsoft Security\nResponse Center. [3], [4]\n\n8. Should I reconfigure Secure Boot?\nNo. Secure Boot is best left enabled in standard mode. Only advanced infrastructures and\nexpert administrators should engage the custom/user-defined mode. Some security software\nmay require additional certificates or hashes to be added to the DB allow list or DBX deny list.\nNo one should disable Secure Boot on an endpoint built within the past 5 years.\n\n9. Can a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) stop BlackLotus?\nNo. A TPM can only detect BlackLotus. Implant boot binaries are delivered to the EFI boot\npartition after the TPM has recorded boot time measurements. Upon the next reboot, the TPM\ncaptures measurements showing a BlackLotus infection. However, a TPM can only detect \u2013\nnot prevent \u2013 implantation as the TPM is an observer and container of integrity indicator data.\nA TPM does not have an active enforcement capability.\nIn a Network Access Control (NAC) infrastructure based on TPM attestation, NAC would\nprevent infected machines from accessing protected resources by indicating changes in\nPlatform Configuration Registers (PCRs) 4-7. NAC also provides an opportunity to remediate\naffected endpoints prior to connecting to a protected resource.\n\n10. Can TPM-extended Shim / TrustedShim (T-Shim) stop BlackLotus?\nNo. T-Shim checks TPM measurements recorded prior to the main boot loader. Secure Boot is\nresponsible for enforcement following T-Shim.\n\n11. What is Secure Boot customization?\nCustomization involves one of the following:\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\nPartial customization \u2013 augmenting the Microsoft and system vendor Secure Boot\necosystem with additional DB and DBX entries as necessary to enable signature and\nhash checks on unsupported/custom software or block unwanted software.\nFull customization \u2013 replacing all vendor and Microsoft certificates and hashes with\nthose generated and selected by the infrastructure owner (requires specialized\nknowledge of hardware values).\n\nU/OO/167397-23 | PP-23-1628 | JUN 2023 Ver. 1.0\n\n6\n\n\fNSA | BlackLotus Mitigation Guide\n\n12. How does BlackLotus compare to Boot Hole?\nBoot Hole involved flaws in Secure Boot-signed GRUB boot loaders. A configuration file could\nbe created to cause buffer overflows and arbitrary code execution at boot time. Secure Boot\ncould be ignored and completely bypassed.\nBlackLotus is sophisticated malware observed in the wild. It exploits a flaw (known as Baton\nDrop) in Secure Boot-signed copies of the Windows Boot Manager to truncate the Secure Boot\npolicy values. Instead of stopping due to the lack DB and DBX values, the vulnerable boot\nmanager allows boot to continue. BlackLotus injects a version of Shim utilizing its own\nMachine Owner Key (MOK) \u2013 similar to the allow list DB \u2013 to vouch for signatures on its own\nmalicious binaries. The result is Secure Boot remains enforcing while silently poisoned and\npermitting malware to execute.\n\n13. Why doesn\u2019t NSA recommend setting up a custom Secure Boot\necosystem as a mitigation?\nNSA has internally piloted efforts to exclusively rely on custom certificates and hashes to\ndefine Secure Boot policy. Pilot efforts have proven effective at preventing threats like\nBlackLotus, Baton Drop, BootHole, and similar prior to discovery. However, the administrative\noverhead and vendor collaboration necessary represent a resource investment not appropriate\nfor most enterprise infrastructures. The process of fully customizing Secure Boot is also not\ncapable of being automated outside of a narrow selection of workstation and server products.\n\n14. Can Trusted eXecution Technology (TXT) stop BlackLotus?\nYes, if and only if the TPM non-volatile memory (NVRAM) policy is set to boot a specific boot\nloader. In practice, setting a specific boot loader has caused administrative challenges when\nhandling updates that affect the EFI boot partition. TXT is not a recommended mitigation given\nthe likelihood to render endpoints temporarily unbootable.\n\n15. Are virtual machines affected?\nYes. VMs boot into a virtual UEFI environment. BlackLotus targets the OS software boot\nloaders that execute following the virtual firmware initialization.\n\nWorks cited\n[1] Microsoft Security Response Center (2022), January 2022 Security Updates.\nhttps://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2022-Jan\n\n[2] Eclypsium (2020), There\u2019s a Hole in the Boot. https://eclypsium.com/2020/07/29/theres-a-hole-in-the-boot\n[3] Microsoft Security Response Center (2023), KB5025885: How to manage the Windows Boot Manager\nrevocations for Secure Boot changes associated with CVE-2023-24932.\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/help/5025885\nU/OO/167397-23 | PP-23-1628 | JUN 2023 Ver. 1.0\n\n7\n\n\fNSA | BlackLotus Mitigation Guide\n\n[4] Microsoft Incident Response (2023), Guidance for investigating attacks using CVE-2022-21894: The\nBlackLotus campaign. https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/2023/04/11/guidance-for-investigatingattacks-using-cve-2022-21894-the-blacklotus-campaign\n[5] Smolar, Martin (2023), BlackLotus UEFI Bootkit: Myth Confirmed.\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2023/03/01/blacklotus-uefi-bootkit-myth-confirmed\n[6] National Security Agency (2020), UEFI Secure Boot Customization [S/N: U/OO/168873-20].\nhttps://media.defense.gov/2020/Sep/15/2002497594/-1/-1/0/CTR-UEFI-SECURE-BOOTCUSTOMIZATION-20200915.PDF/CTR-UEFI-SECURE-BOOT-CUSTOMIZATION-20200915.PDF\n[7] National Security Agency (2020), UEFI Secure Boot Customization.\nhttps://github.com/nsacyber/Hardware-and-Firmware-Security-Guidance/tree/master/secureboot\n[8] Carnegie Mellon University (2022), UEFI \u2013 Terra Firma for Attackers.\nhttps://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/uefi-terra-firma-for-attackers/\n[9] Microsoft (2022), Windows Secure Boot Key Creation and Management Guidance.\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-secure-boot-keycreation-and-management-guidance\n\nDisclaimer of endorsement\nThe information and opinions contained in this document are provided \"as is\" and without any warranties or guarantees.\nReference herein to any specific commercial products, process, or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, or\notherwise, does not constitute or imply its endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by the United States Government.

Leverage these tools to look for unexpected\nU/OO/167397-23 | PP-23-1628 | JUN 2023 Ver. 1.0\n\n2\n\n\fNSA | BlackLotus Mitigation Guide\n\nchanges in bootmgfw.efi, bootmgr.efi, or the introduction of additional unexpected EFI binaries\n(e.g., shimx64.efi or grubx64.efi). Changes to the boot partition are infrequent and warrant\nadditional scrutiny.\nIf unexpected changes are detected within the EFI boot partition, prevent the device from\nrebooting. Endpoint and host defensive suites may allow creating rules or triggers that can be\npaired with group policies to temporarily restrict reboot. Remediate the boot partition to a\nknown good state before permitting reboot. A reboot will execute EFI binaries and can implant\nBlackLotus.\nMicrosoft has published specific information regarding the staging of BlackLotus components,\nalterations to Windows registry values, and network indicators. Full specifics can be found at\nthe Microsoft Incident Response blog. [4]\n\nAction 4: Customize UEFI Secure Boot\n4.A. Instructions for Windows infrastructures. Expertly administered and exposed\ninfrastructures only. Not recommended due to limited long-term effectiveness.\nBlackLotus relies upon older (pre-January 2022), signed Windows boot loader images to\nimplant a system. Secure Boot can be updated with DBX deny list hashes that prevent\nexecuting older and vulnerable boot loaders. Public reporting [5] provides indications as to\nwhich boot managers are observed exploited in the wild. In 2020, NSA published \"UEFI\nSecure Boot Customization\" to provide guidance on modifying Secure Boot. Adding DBX\nhashes qualifies as a partial customization action covered in section 4 \"Customization,\"\nstarting on page 7, and continuing through section 4.4.3 \u201cUpdate the DB or DBX.\u201d [6]\nAdditionally, a GitHub.com repository has been set up with some helpful scripts and guides to\naccomplish customization. [7]\nNote: Adding boot loader hashes to the DBX may render many Windows install and recovery\nimages, discs, and removable media drives unbootable. Microsoft provides updated install and\nrecovery images for Windows 11 and 10. Only update the DBX after acquiring install and\nrecovery media with the January 2022 or later patch assortment applied (e.g., version 22H1 or\nnewer).\nWarning: The following DBX hashes may be combined with the Secure Boot Customization\nsteps to revoke trust in select boot loaders vulnerable to Baton Drop. [6] However, more\nvulnerable boot loaders exist than the DBX can contain. BlackLotus developers can rapidly\nswitch to alternate vulnerable boot loaders to evade DBX customization. Mitigating BlackLotus\n\nU/OO/167397-23 | PP-23-1628 | JUN 2023 Ver. 1.0\n\n3\n\n\fNSA | BlackLotus Mitigation Guide\n\nvia DBX updates is not recommended.

Instructions for Linux infrastructures. Expertly administered and exposed\ninfrastructures only.\nLinux system administrators may forego adding DBX hashes in favor of removing the Microsoft\nWindows Production CA 2011 certificate from Secure Boot\u2019s DB. The total number of Baton\nDrop-vulnerable boot loaders signed by the key associated with the Production CA\u2019s certificate\nis thought to exceed the available DBX memory. Removing the certificate negates the need to\nadd DBX entries related to Baton Drop and BlackLotus. Linux administrators will still need the\nMicrosoft Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) Third Party Marketplace CA 2011\ncertificate to utilize Secure Boot with leading Linux distributions. [6]\nDo not place the Windows Production CA 2011 certificate in the Machine Owner Key Exclusion\n(MOKX) list in lieu of removing it from the DB. Utilizing MOKX in this way will cause the\nrevoked certificate to still be trusted between firmware initialization and the initialization of\nShim\u2019s Secure Boot extensions.\nThe Windows Production CA 2011 certificate must be restored if converting the device from\nLinux to Windows. Microsoft provides the certificate for download via their resources for\nsystem manufacturers. [9]\n\nU/OO/167397-23 | PP-23-1628 | JUN 2023 Ver. 1.0\n\n4\n\n\fNSA | BlackLotus Mitigation Guide\n\nFrequently asked questions\n1. Is BlackLotus a firmware implant?\nNo. BlackLotus is boot software. The UEFI boot process involves several phases. Execution\ncontrol flow transitions from firmware to software following the Boot Device Select phase. [8]\n\n2. Can BlackLotus be removed or quarantined?\nYes, prior to execution. Devices that boot to a BlackLotus EFI binary will need to be completely\nreimaged. Attempts to remove BlackLotus following installation result in kernel errors.\n\n3. Does BlackLotus bypass Secure Boot?\nAn initial bypass is followed by poisoning that configures Secure Boot to trust the malware. An\nolder, vulnerable boot loader that is trusted by Secure Boot is necessary to strip the Secure\nBoot policy from being enforced so that BlackLotus can implant its entire software stack.\nSubsequent boots extend the Microsoft UEFI signing ecosystem with a malicious BlackLotus\ncertificate. Thus, Secure Boot will trust the malware.\n\n4. Which version of Windows is affected?\nBlackLotus targets Windows 11 and 10. Variants may exist to target older, UEFI-booting\nversions of Windows. Patches are available for Windows 8.1, 10, and 11.\n\n5. Is Linux affected? Is there a version of BlackLotus that targets Linux?\nNo, not that has been identified at this time. BlackLotus does incorporate some Linux boot\nbinaries, but the malware targets Windows OS software. No Linux-targeting variant has been\nobserved.\n\n6. Is BlackLotus really unstoppable?\nNo \u2013 BlackLotus is very stoppable on fully updated Windows endpoints, Secure Bootcustomized devices, or Linux endpoints. Microsoft has released patches and continues to\nharden mitigations against BlackLotus and Baton Drop. [1], [3], [4] The Linux community may\nremove the Microsoft Windows Production CA 2011 certificate on devices that exclusively boot\nLinux. Mitigation options available today will be reinforced by changes to vendor Secure Boot\ncertificates in the future (some certificates are expiring starting in 2026).\n\n7. Where can I find more public information?\nNSA is aware of several technically deep analysis reports posted online from security\nresearchers and vendors. One thorough source of public information is ESET Security\u2019s blog\nU/OO/167397-23 | PP-23-1628 | JUN 2023 Ver. 1.0\n\n5\n\n\fNSA | BlackLotus Mitigation Guide\n\nreferenced as [5] in this report. Another source of information is the Microsoft Security\nResponse Center. [3], [4]\n\n8. Should I reconfigure Secure Boot?\nNo. Secure Boot is best left enabled in standard mode. Only advanced infrastructures and\nexpert administrators should engage the custom/user-defined mode. Some security software\nmay require additional certificates or hashes to be added to the DB allow list or DBX deny list.\nNo one should disable Secure Boot on an endpoint built within the past 5 years.\n\n9. Can a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) stop BlackLotus?\nNo. A TPM can only detect BlackLotus. Implant boot binaries are delivered to the EFI boot\npartition after the TPM has recorded boot time measurements. Upon the next reboot, the TPM\ncaptures measurements showing a BlackLotus infection. However, a TPM can only detect \u2013\nnot prevent \u2013 implantation as the TPM is an observer and container of integrity indicator data.\nA TPM does not have an active enforcement capability.\nIn a Network Access Control (NAC) infrastructure based on TPM attestation, NAC would\nprevent infected machines from accessing protected resources by indicating changes in\nPlatform Configuration Registers (PCRs) 4-7. NAC also provides an opportunity to remediate\naffected endpoints prior to connecting to a protected resource.\n\n10. Can TPM-extended Shim / TrustedShim (T-Shim) stop BlackLotus?\nNo. T-Shim checks TPM measurements recorded prior to the main boot loader. Secure Boot is\nresponsible for enforcement following T-Shim.\n\n11. What is Secure Boot customization?\nCustomization involves one of the following:\n\uf0b7\n\n\uf0b7\n\nPartial customization \u2013 augmenting the Microsoft and system vendor Secure Boot\necosystem with additional DB and DBX entries as necessary to enable signature and\nhash checks on unsupported/custom software or block unwanted software.\nFull customization \u2013 replacing all vendor and Microsoft certificates and hashes with\nthose generated and selected by the infrastructure owner (requires specialized\nknowledge of hardware values).\n\nU/OO/167397-23 | PP-23-1628 | JUN 2023 Ver. 1.0\n\n6\n\n\fNSA | BlackLotus Mitigation Guide\n\n12. How does BlackLotus compare to Boot Hole?\nBoot Hole involved flaws in Secure Boot-signed GRUB boot loaders. A configuration file could\nbe created to cause buffer overflows and arbitrary code execution at boot time. Secure Boot\ncould be ignored and completely bypassed.\nBlackLotus is sophisticated malware observed in the wild. It exploits a flaw (known as Baton\nDrop) in Secure Boot-signed copies of the Windows Boot Manager to truncate the Secure Boot\npolicy values. Instead of stopping due to the lack DB and DBX values, the vulnerable boot\nmanager allows boot to continue. BlackLotus injects a version of Shim utilizing its own\nMachine Owner Key (MOK) \u2013 similar to the allow list DB \u2013 to vouch for signatures on its own\nmalicious binaries. The result is Secure Boot remains enforcing while silently poisoned and\npermitting malware to execute.\n\n13. Why doesn\u2019t NSA recommend setting up a custom Secure Boot\necosystem as a mitigation?\nNSA has internally piloted efforts to exclusively rely on custom certificates and hashes to\ndefine Secure Boot policy. Pilot efforts have proven effective at preventing threats like\nBlackLotus, Baton Drop, BootHole, and similar prior to discovery. However, the administrative\noverhead and vendor collaboration necessary represent a resource investment not appropriate\nfor most enterprise infrastructures. The process of fully customizing Secure Boot is also not\ncapable of being automated outside of a narrow selection of workstation and server products.\n\n14. Can Trusted eXecution Technology (TXT) stop BlackLotus?\nYes, if and only if the TPM non-volatile memory (NVRAM) policy is set to boot a specific boot\nloader. In practice, setting a specific boot loader has caused administrative challenges when\nhandling updates that affect the EFI boot partition. TXT is not a recommended mitigation given\nthe likelihood to render endpoints temporarily unbootable.\n\n15. Are virtual machines affected?\nYes. VMs boot into a virtual UEFI environment. BlackLotus targets the OS software boot\nloaders that execute following the virtual firmware initialization.\n\nWorks cited\n[1] Microsoft Security Response Center (2022), January 2022 Security Updates.\nhttps://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2022-Jan\n\n[2] Eclypsium (2020), There\u2019s a Hole in the Boot. https://eclypsium.com/2020/07/29/theres-a-hole-in-the-boot\n[3] Microsoft Security Response Center (2023), KB5025885: How to manage the Windows Boot Manager\nrevocations for Secure Boot changes associated with CVE-2023-24932.\nhttps://support.microsoft.com/help/5025885\nU/OO/167397-23 | PP-23-1628 | JUN 2023 Ver. 1.0\n\n7\n\n\fNSA | BlackLotus Mitigation Guide\n\n[4] Microsoft Incident Response (2023), Guidance for investigating attacks using CVE-2022-21894: The\nBlackLotus campaign. https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/2023/04/11/guidance-for-investigatingattacks-using-cve-2022-21894-the-blacklotus-campaign\n[5] Smolar, Martin (2023), BlackLotus UEFI Bootkit: Myth Confirmed.\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2023/03/01/blacklotus-uefi-bootkit-myth-confirmed\n[6] National Security Agency (2020), UEFI Secure Boot Customization [S/N: U/OO/168873-20].\nhttps://media.defense.gov/2020/Sep/15/2002497594/-1/-1/0/CTR-UEFI-SECURE-BOOTCUSTOMIZATION-20200915.PDF/CTR-UEFI-SECURE-BOOT-CUSTOMIZATION-20200915.PDF\n[7] National Security Agency (2020), UEFI Secure Boot Customization.\nhttps://github.com/nsacyber/Hardware-and-Firmware-Security-Guidance/tree/master/secureboot\n[8] Carnegie Mellon University (2022), UEFI \u2013 Terra Firma for Attackers.\nhttps://insights.sei.cmu.edu/blog/uefi-terra-firma-for-attackers/\n[9] Microsoft (2022), Windows Secure Boot Key Creation and Management Guidance.\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-secure-boot-keycreation-and-management-guidance\n\nDisclaimer of endorsement\nThe information and opinions contained in this document are provided \"as is\" and without any warranties or guarantees.\nReference herein to any specific commercial products, process, or service by trade name, trademark, manufacturer, or\notherwise, does not constitute or imply its endorsement, recommendation, or favoring by the United States Government.

system.\n3Introduction to This Guide\nThis guide is intended to provide you with information to help you learn to\noperate the features within your new CustoPAK system and get the most out\nof its many benefits.\nBefore you begin using your new CustoPAK system, it is important to know your\nswitch type, or the type of equipment in the Verizon central office that handles\nyour telephone service. Your switch type is shown on the front cover of this\nguide and may affect which features are available with your CustoPAK system.\nBasic Features are automatically activated for each of your lines when\nyou purchase your CustoPAK system.Upon installation of your system, your Verizon representative will assist you in\nfilling out your Feature Grid (see Appendix). Once complete, this grid indicates\nwhich features you have selected for each of your CustoPAK lines. The Appendix\nsection also contains your Intercom and Speed Calling code charts. You may\nwish to make copies of these handy tools and distribute them to other users in\nyour CustoPAK system for easy reference.\nSelectable Features are available for each of your CustoPAK lines at no\nadditional monthly charge, but must be installed to be used.1The Overview section which follows this Introduction will begin to acquaint you with\nyour new CustoPAK system and the many benefits it provides.\nOptional Features are available at an additional charge per line and must\nalso be installed to be used.1We are delighted that you have chosen Verizon. We hope this guide makes the\ntransition to your new CustoPAK system as smooth as possible.\nThe Features section of this guide describes the three types of features which\nare available to choose from:\nYou may select as many or as few of the Selectable and Optional features as\nyou like for each of your CustoPAK lines, and may change them at any time.\nShould you need assistance selecting additional features or changing features,\nyour Verizon representative is available to guide you. All features available with\nCustoPAK are included in this guide regardless of whether you have selected\nthem for your system.\n1\nTo install these features, contact your Verizon representative. Installation charges may apply.\n4\nDownloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine\nFor Customer Services, call\n1-800 -483-5000\nIn Hawaii, call\n643-4411\n5Overview of Your CustoPAK System\nYour CustoPAK system is a central office-based service, meaning all equipment\nrequired to operate the system is in the Verizon central office. That also means\nyou have purchased a reliable, worry-free telephone system, as our central\noffices are monitored 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\nYour CustoPAK system can grow as your business grows. It has the capacity\nto handle up to 30 telephone lines, and offers a flexible package of features\ndesigned specifically with the small business customer in mind. You can\nselect which features you want for each of your CustoPAK lines based on your\nbusiness and communications needs. You may add or change features at any\ntime by contacting your Verizon representative (additional charges may apply).\nCustoPAK can be customized to perform as a complete telephone system\nworking on standard single-line telephones or as feature-rich access lines\nenhancing your existing telephone system. When used with existing telephone\nsystems, features like Call Transfer, Three-Way Calling and Consultation Hold\ngive you the functionality of a built-in second line. When using these features,\nother lines remain free for incoming or outgoing calls. And, Call Forwarding\nand Call Transfer allow you to easily transfer your calls to another location\noutside your system without additional equipment.\nMost of the features are activated by the use of codes. You\u2019ll find all of the\ninformation required to activate the CustoPAK features listed in the Features\nsection of this guide.\nYour CustoPAK system comes with a 30-day satisfaction guarantee (except\nCalifornia). We are confident that this system is the right solution for your\nbusiness needs. However, with this guarantee you are entitled to a full credit\nof the CustoPAK charges and a change back to your previous Verizon service\nif you are not satisfied and notify us within 30 calendar days.\nRepair\nThe Repair Center handles service problems and out-of-service conditions on\nyour telephone lines and/or features, and the wiring to your location. It does\nnot handle and cannot fix your telephone equipment.\nFor problems with the wiring inside your business, you may repair it yourself,\nhire a contractor or an electrician, or call Verizon. Verizon does this type of\nrepair for a fee based on the amount of time and the cost of the materials\nrequired to correct the problem. For information on these services, contact\nyour Verizon representative.\nThe Verizon repair number is 1-800-483-2000. The Repair Center is open\n24 hours a day, including holidays.\nHelp Desk\nThe CentraNet/Voice Mail Help Desk was established to answer your questions\nabout the operation of your CentraNet CustoPAK and Voice Mail services. Our\nHelp Desk will explain how the services and features operate, e.g., How do\nI transfer a call? How do I reset my Passcode?\nIf you have questions about your CentraNet CustoPAK service, please call the\nHelp Desk at 1-800 - 483 -2000.\nThe Help Desk is available Monday-Friday between the hours of 5 a.m.-7 p.m.\nand Saturday between the hours of 7 a.m.- 4 p.m. Pacific Time. The Help Desk\nis closed on Sunday.\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION: Verizon is in the process of updating all our\ncentral office switches to provide access to Per Call Blocking. This feature\nallows you to prevent the appearance of your phone number on Caller ID\ndisplay units on a per call basis.\nPress *\n6\nDownloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine\n6\n7\nbefore placing an outgoing call to activate this feature.\n7Terms You Should KnowCustoPAK Basic Features\nConfirmation Tone\nThree short bursts of tone heard when using some CustoPAK features. The\nconfirmation tone lets you know you have completed the activation or deactivation\nof the features.The features listed in this section are automatically included on each of your\nCustoPAK lines.

Use Call Hold to help improve response time\nwhile reducing equipment costs and callbacks.1.) Only one call can be placed on hold at a time per telephone line.\n2.) A holding call cannot be added to another call.\n3.) Call Hold overrides Dial Call Waiting and Call Waiting. When you put a call\non hold to use the line to make or receive a second call, a third incoming\ncall will receive a busy signal.\nTo place an established call on hold:\n\u0002Tell the person to whom you are speaking that you are going to put them on hold.\n\u0002Press the switchhook (or the Tap/Flash/Recall/Link button, depending on your\ntelephone set).\nCall Transfer\n\u0002Listen for dial tone.\u0002Press *\u0002You will hear confirmation tone, followed by dial tone.This valuable feature enables you to transfer an incoming call to any other\nnumber either inside or outside of your CustoPAK system.

This allows you to place another call for private consultation\nor to initiate a three-way call. Use Consultation Hold to quickly verify customer\ninquiries and reduce costly and time-consuming callbacks.Direct Inward Dialing allows you to receive incoming calls directly at your station.\nThis can help enhance customer service by allowing incoming callers to quickly\nreach you without the delay of a call transfer.

Feature Selections........................................................... 54\nPlease be sure to read the Introduction and Overview sections of this\nguide prior to operating your new CustoPAK system.\n3Introduction to This Guide\nThis guide is intended to provide you with information to help you learn to\noperate the features within your new CustoPAK system and get the most out\nof its many benefits.\nBefore you begin using your new CustoPAK system, it is important to know your\nswitch type, or the type of equipment in the Verizon central office that handles\nyour telephone service. Your switch type is shown on the front cover of this\nguide and may affect which features are available with your CustoPAK system.\nBasic Features are automatically activated for each of your lines when\nyou purchase your CustoPAK system.Upon installation of your system, your Verizon representative will assist you in\nfilling out your Feature Grid (see Appendix). Once complete, this grid indicates\nwhich features you have selected for each of your CustoPAK lines. The Appendix\nsection also contains your Intercom and Speed Calling code charts. You may\nwish to make copies of these handy tools and distribute them to other users in\nyour CustoPAK system for easy reference.\nSelectable Features are available for each of your CustoPAK lines at no\nadditional monthly charge, but must be installed to be used.1The Overview section which follows this Introduction will begin to acquaint you with\nyour new CustoPAK system and the many benefits it provides.\nOptional Features are available at an additional charge per line and must\nalso be installed to be used.1We are delighted that you have chosen Verizon. We hope this guide makes the\ntransition to your new CustoPAK system as smooth as possible.\nThe Features section of this guide describes the three types of features which\nare available to choose from:\nYou may select as many or as few of the Selectable and Optional features as\nyou like for each of your CustoPAK lines, and may change them at any time.\nShould you need assistance selecting additional features or changing features,\nyour Verizon representative is available to guide you. All features available with\nCustoPAK are included in this guide regardless of whether you have selected\nthem for your system.\n1\nTo install these features, contact your Verizon representative. Installation charges may apply.\n4\nDownloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine\nFor Customer Services, call\n1-800 -483-5000\nIn Hawaii, call\n643-4411\n5Overview of Your CustoPAK System\nYour CustoPAK system is a central office-based service, meaning all equipment\nrequired to operate the system is in the Verizon central office. That also means\nyou have purchased a reliable, worry-free telephone system, as our central\noffices are monitored 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.\nYour CustoPAK system can grow as your business grows. It has the capacity\nto handle up to 30 telephone lines, and offers a flexible package of features\ndesigned specifically with the small business customer in mind. You can\nselect which features you want for each of your CustoPAK lines based on your\nbusiness and communications needs. You may add or change features at any\ntime by contacting your Verizon representative (additional charges may apply).\nCustoPAK can be customized to perform as a complete telephone system\nworking on standard single-line telephones or as feature-rich access lines\nenhancing your existing telephone system. When used with existing telephone\nsystems, features like Call Transfer, Three-Way Calling and Consultation Hold\ngive you the functionality of a built-in second line. When using these features,\nother lines remain free for incoming or outgoing calls. And, Call Forwarding\nand Call Transfer allow you to easily transfer your calls to another location\noutside your system without additional equipment.\nMost of the features are activated by the use of codes. You\u2019ll find all of the\ninformation required to activate the CustoPAK features listed in the Features\nsection of this guide.\nYour CustoPAK system comes with a 30-day satisfaction guarantee (except\nCalifornia). We are confident that this system is the right solution for your\nbusiness needs. However, with this guarantee you are entitled to a full credit\nof the CustoPAK charges and a change back to your previous Verizon service\nif you are not satisfied and notify us within 30 calendar days.\nRepair\nThe Repair Center handles service problems and out-of-service conditions on\nyour telephone lines and/or features, and the wiring to your location. It does\nnot handle and cannot fix your telephone equipment.\nFor problems with the wiring inside your business, you may repair it yourself,\nhire a contractor or an electrician, or call Verizon. Verizon does this type of\nrepair for a fee based on the amount of time and the cost of the materials\nrequired to correct the problem. For information on these services, contact\nyour Verizon representative.\nThe Verizon repair number is 1-800-483-2000. The Repair Center is open\n24 hours a day, including holidays.\nHelp Desk\nThe CentraNet/Voice Mail Help Desk was established to answer your questions\nabout the operation of your CentraNet CustoPAK and Voice Mail services. Our\nHelp Desk will explain how the services and features operate, e.g., How do\nI transfer a call? How do I reset my Passcode?\nIf you have questions about your CentraNet CustoPAK service, please call the\nHelp Desk at 1-800 - 483 -2000.\nThe Help Desk is available Monday-Friday between the hours of 5 a.m.-7 p.m.\nand Saturday between the hours of 7 a.m.- 4 p.m. Pacific Time. The Help Desk\nis closed on Sunday.\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION: Verizon is in the process of updating all our\ncentral office switches to provide access to Per Call Blocking. This feature\nallows you to prevent the appearance of your phone number on Caller ID\ndisplay units on a per call basis.\nPress *\n6\nDownloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine\n6\n7\nbefore placing an outgoing call to activate this feature.\n7Terms You Should KnowCustoPAK Basic Features\nConfirmation Tone\nThree short bursts of tone heard when using some CustoPAK features. The\nconfirmation tone lets you know you have completed the activation or deactivation\nof the features.The features listed in this section are automatically included on each of your\nCustoPAK lines. These basic features are the backbone of your new CustoPAK\nsystem. Three of these features, Consultation Hold, Call Transfer and Three-Way\nCalling provide you with the functionality of a built-in second line.\nRegional Calling Area\nThe area within which Verizon can provide local and regional toll calling services.\nSwitch Type\nThis term identifies the types of equipment in Verizon\u2019s central office that\nhandles your telephone service. Your switch type is shown on the front cover of\nthis guide. It is very important to be aware of your switch type, as it may affect\nwhich features are available with your CustoPAK system.\nAssume Dial \u201c9\u201d\nThis convenient feature allows you to place calls outside of the CustoPAK system\nwithout having to dial the access code \u201c9\u201d.\nNOTE: Verizon has automatically activated this feature. You cannot activate or\ndeactivate the feature as you choose.\nSwitchhook\nThe buttons or bar generally located under the receiver on a standard desk\ntelephone or electronic set. The switchhook initiates dial tone and is used to\noperate some of the CustoPAK features.\nTap\nFlash\nRecall\nLink\nThese terms refer to preprogrammed buttons on some telephones, that when\nused replace the switchhook. If your telephone is equipped with one of these\nbuttons, always use it instead of the switchhook to operate the CustoPAK features.\n8\nDownloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine\n9Call HoldNOTES:\nCall Hold allows you to place an established call on hold for an extended period\nof time\u2014provided neither you nor the other person hangs up\u2014freeing up the\nline to place or receive another call. Use Call Hold to help improve response time\nwhile reducing equipment costs and callbacks.1.) Only one call can be placed on hold at a time per telephone line.\n2.) A holding call cannot be added to another call.\n3.) Call Hold overrides Dial Call Waiting and Call Waiting. When you put a call\non hold to use the line to make or receive a second call, a third incoming\ncall will receive a busy signal.\nTo place an established call on hold:\n\u0002Tell the person to whom you are speaking that you are going to put them on hold.\n\u0002Press the switchhook (or the Tap/Flash/Recall/Link button, depending on your\ntelephone set).\nCall Transfer\n\u0002Listen for dial tone.\u0002Press *\u0002You will hear confirmation tone, followed by dial tone.This valuable feature enables you to transfer an incoming call to any other\nnumber either inside or outside of your CustoPAK system. You can privately\nspeak with the called party to announce the call prior to completing the transfer.\nUse Call Transfer as an efficient way to process misdirected calls and reduce\nmessage-taking and call handling time.\n\u0002The call is on hold. Place the handset beside the telephone\u2014do not hang up!To transfer an incoming call:\n0\n1 .\nTo place another call, while the first caller is on hold:\u0002Tell the person to whom you are speaking that you are going to put them on hold.\n\u0002\u0002Press the switchhook (or the Tap/Flash/Recall/Link button, depending on\nyour telephone set).\n\u0002Listen for dial tone.\n\u0002To transfer to an internal CustoPAK line, dial the intercom code assigned\nto the internal line. To transfer to an outside line dial the number to which\nyou wish to transfer the call.\n\u0002Privately announce the transfer to the recipient. Hang up.\n\u0002\nKey in destination phone number of the third party. Wait for the party to\nanswer. If you encounter a busy signal, no answer or if an error is made in\ndialing, press the switchhook (or the Tap/Flash/Recall/Link button, depending\non your telephone set) twice to connect to the original party.\nWhen party answers you may consult privately.\nTo return to a call that is on hold:\n\u0002Press the switchhook (or the Tap/Flash/Recall/Link button, depending on your\ntelephone set).\n\u0002Listen for confirmation tone.\n\u0002Press *\n0\n1\n(you may now talk to the person that was on hold).\n-OR-\n\u0002Hang up (your phone will ring).\n\u0002Lift the handset (you may now talk to the party that was on hold).\n10\nDownloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine\n-OR-\n\u0002\nHang up (the call is automatically transferred).\nNOTES:\n1.) If you receive a busy signal, no answer or if an error is made in dialing,\npress the switchhook twice to reconnect to the original call.\n2.) You cannot transfer a call while on a Three-Way or Call Waiting call.\n3.) A call placed from a CustoPAK line to a number outside the system cannot\nbe transferred to another number outside the system.\n4.) Call Transfer may generate local, regional toll or long distance charges.\n11Consultation HoldDirect Inward/Outward Dialing (DID/DOD)\nConsultation Hold provides a temporary or \u201csoft\u201d hold without having to dial\nan activation code. This allows you to place another call for private consultation\nor to initiate a three-way call. Use Consultation Hold to quickly verify customer\ninquiries and reduce costly and time-consuming callbacks.Direct Inward Dialing allows you to receive incoming calls directly at your station.\nThis can help enhance customer service by allowing incoming callers to quickly\nreach you without the delay of a call transfer. Direct Outward Dialing improves\nefficiency by enabling you to place calls to locations outside the system without\nfirst dialing an access code or going through a central attendant.\nTo place a call on hold:\n\u0002Tell the person to whom you are speaking that you are going to put them on hold.\n\u0002Press the switchhook (or the Tap/Flash/Recall/Link button, depending on your\ntelephone set).\n\u0002Listen for dial tone.\n\u0002Dial the third party (if you encounter a busy signal, no answer or if an error is\nmade in dialing, press the switchhook twice to reconnect to the original call).\n\u0002When the third party answers, you may consult privately before reconnecting\nto the original call.\nTo return to the original caller:\n\u0002Allow the third party to hang up.\n\u0002Press the switchhook twice (if the switchhook is only pressed once, a three-way\ncall will be established).\nNOTES:\n1.) Consultation Hold overrides Dial Call Waiting and Call Waiting. When you put\na call on hold to use the line to place a second call, a third incoming call will\nreceive a busy signal.\n2.) Call Forwarding cannot be activated while a call is on Consultation Hold.\n12\nDownloaded from www.Manualslib.com manuals search engine\nNOTE: Verizon has automatically activated this feature. You cannot activate or\ndeactivate the feature as you choose.\nDistinctive Ringing (Inside/Outside Ringing)\nCustoPAK Distinctive Ringing provides you with the ability to distinguish between\ninternal and external incoming calls, allowing you to greet customers and callers\nfrom outside of your system more professionally. Internal calls\u2014calls placed by\nsomeone within the CustoPAK system using the Intercom feature\u2014will ring with\na single ring. External calls\u2014calls made from outside of the CustoPAK system\u2014\nare identified by a double ring. This feature is not available in the GTD-5\nswitch.\nNOTES:\n1.) Many telephone sets have their own distinctive ringing patterns that are not\nassociated with CustoPAK Distinctive Ringing.\n2.) Priority Call and Distinctive Ringing cannot be on the same CustoPAK line,\nsince they share the same ring patterns.\n3.)

In order to reduce the risk of insolvency, regulators have imposed capital\nrequirements on commercial and investment banks.76 In order to reduce depositors\u2019 incentives to \u201crun,\u201d regulators require all commercial banks to obtain minimum levels of deposit insurance\nfrom the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).77 In order to address liquidity problems,\nthe Federal Reserve has the authority to serve as a \u201clender of last resort\u201d by making \u201cdiscount\nwindow\u201d loans to commercial banks.78 Moreover, the Federal Reserve can lend to non-banks in\n\u201cunusual and exigent circumstances\u201d pursuant to its authority under Section 13(3) of the Federal\nReserve Act.79 However, as the 2007-2009 financial crisis arguably demonstrated, sometimes\nthese measures have proven insufficient to prevent financial institution failures.\nIn response to these concerns, Title I of Dodd-Frank establishes an enhanced prudential\nregulatory regime for certain large financial institutions.80 Specifically, the Title I regime applies\nto (1) all bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, and (2)\nany non-bank financial companies81 that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC)82\n\ndesignates as systemically important.83 Section 165 of Dodd-Frank directs the Federal Reserve to\nimpose prudential standards on these institutions that \u201care more stringent than\u201d those applicable\nto other bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies, and that \u201cincrease in\nstringency\u201d based on certain statutorily-prescribed considerations.84 These enhanced standards\ninclude\n1. risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits;\n85\n2. liquidity requirements;\n86\n3. overall risk management requirements;\n87\n4. a requirement that the relevant companies develop resolution plans (so-called\n\u201cliving wills\u201d) describing how they can be rapidly resolved in the event of\nmaterial distress or failure;\n88 and\n5. credit exposure reporting requirements.89\nCongress is currently considering whether to change the first basis for imposition of enhanced\nprudential regulations on financial institutions\u2014the automatic $50 billion threshold for bank\nholding companies.90 That policy question is addressed in another recent Congressional Research\nService report.91 This section of the report accordingly provides a legal overview of (1) FSOC\u2019s\nprocess for designating non-banks as systemically important and FSOC\u2019s designations to date, (2)\ncriticisms of FSOC\u2019s designation process and responses, and (3) proposals to reform FSOC\u2019s\ndesignation process.\n\nProposed Legislation\nA number of bills that would alter FSOC\u2019s authority to designate non-banks for enhanced\nregulation have been introduced in the 115th Congress. The Financial CHOICE Act of 2017, as\npassed by the House of Representatives in June 2017, would repeal FSOC\u2019s authority to\ndesignate non-banks for enhanced regulation altogether.167 H.R. 4061, the Financial Stability\nOversight Council Improvement Act of 2017, which was reported out of the House Committee on\nFinancial Services in March 2018, proposes more limited changes to FSOC\u2019s authority.168\nSpecifically, H.R. 4061 would require FSOC to consider \u201cthe appropriateness of the imposition of\nprudential standards as opposed to other forms of regulation to mitigate the identified risks\u201d in\ndetermining whether to designate a non-bank as systemically important.169 The bill would further\nrequire that FSOC provide designated companies with the opportunity to submit written materials\ncontesting their designation during FSOC\u2019s annual reevaluation process.170 If FSOC determines\nduring a re-evaluation that a designation should not be rescinded, the bill would require it to\nprovide notice to the designated company \u201caddress[ing] with specificity\u201d how it assessed the\nrelevant statutory factors in light of the company\u2019s written submissions.171\nThe Trump Administration\u2019s Views\nIn November 2017, the Trump Administration\u2019s Treasury Department released a report outlining\nfour general recommendations for reforming FSOC\u2019s process for designating non-banks as\nsystemically important.172 First, the report recommended that FSOC adopt an \u201cactivities-based\u201d or \u201cindustry-wide\u201d approach to assessing potential risks posed by non-banks.173 Under this\napproach, FSOC would prioritize identifying specific financial activities and products that could\npose risks to financial stability, work with the primary financial regulatory agencies to address\nthose specific risks, and consider individual firms for designation as systemically important only\nas a matter of last resort if more limited actions aimed at mitigating discrete risks are insufficient\nto safeguard financial stability.174\nSecond, the Treasury Department recommended that FSOC \u201cincreas[e] the analytical rigor\u201d of its\ndesignation analyses.175 Specifically, the Report recommended that FSOC: (1) consider any\nfactors that might mitigate the exposure of a firm\u2019s creditors and counterparties to its financial\ndistress; (2) focus on \u201cplausible\u201d (and not merely \u201cpossible\u201d) asset liquidation risks; (3) evaluate\nthe likelihood that a firm will experience financial distress before evaluating how that distress\ncould be transmitted to other firms; (4) consider the benefits and costs of designations; and\n(5) collapse its three-stage review process into two steps, notifying companies that they are under\nactive review during Stage 1 and voting on proposed designations after the completion of Stage\n2.176\nThird, the Treasury Department recommended enhancing engagement between FSOC and\ncompanies under review, and improving the designation process\u2019s transparency.177 Specifically,\nthe report recommended that FSOC: (1) engage earlier with companies under review and \u201cexplain\n... the key risks\u201d that FSOC has identified, (2) \u201cundertake greater engagement\u201d with companies\u2019\nprimary financial regulators, and (3) publicly release explanations of its designation decisions.178\nFourth, the Treasury Department recommended that FSOC provide \u201ca clear off-ramp\u201d for nonbanks designated as systemically important.179 The report recommended that FSOC: (1) highlight\nthe key risks that led to a company\u2019s designation, (2) \u201cadopt a more robust and transparent\nprocess for its annual reevaluations\u201d that \u201cmake[s] clear how companies can engage with FSOC\n... and what information companies should submit during a reevaluation,\u201d (3) \u201cdevelop a process\nto enable a designated company to discuss potential changes it could make to address the risks it\ncould pose to financial stability,\u201d and (4) \u201cmake clear that the standard it applies in its annual\nreevaluations is the same as the standard for an initial designation of a nonbank financial\ncompany.\u201d", "full_prompt": "Summarize the proposed changes to Dodd-Frank 1.

The Financial CHOICE Act of 2017, as\npassed by the House of Representatives in June 2017, would repeal FSOC\u2019s authority to\ndesignate non-banks for enhanced regulation altogether.167 H.R. 4061, the Financial Stability\nOversight Council Improvement Act of 2017, which was reported out of the House Committee on\nFinancial Services in March 2018, proposes more limited changes to FSOC\u2019s authority.168\nSpecifically, H.R. 4061 would require FSOC to consider \u201cthe appropriateness of the imposition of\nprudential standards as opposed to other forms of regulation to mitigate the identified risks\u201d in\ndetermining whether to designate a non-bank as systemically important.169 The bill would further\nrequire that FSOC provide designated companies with the opportunity to submit written materials\ncontesting their designation during FSOC\u2019s annual reevaluation process.170 If FSOC determines\nduring a re-evaluation that a designation should not be rescinded, the bill would require it to\nprovide notice to the designated company \u201caddress[ing] with specificity\u201d how it assessed the\nrelevant statutory factors in light of the company\u2019s written submissions.171\nThe Trump Administration\u2019s Views\nIn November 2017, the Trump Administration\u2019s Treasury Department released a report outlining\nfour general recommendations for reforming FSOC\u2019s process for designating non-banks as\nsystemically important.172 First, the report recommended that FSOC adopt an \u201cactivities-based\u201d or \u201cindustry-wide\u201d approach to assessing potential risks posed by non-banks.173 Under this\napproach, FSOC would prioritize identifying specific financial activities and products that could\npose risks to financial stability, work with the primary financial regulatory agencies to address\nthose specific risks, and consider individual firms for designation as systemically important only\nas a matter of last resort if more limited actions aimed at mitigating discrete risks are insufficient\nto safeguard financial stability.174\nSecond, the Treasury Department recommended that FSOC \u201cincreas[e] the analytical rigor\u201d of its\ndesignation analyses.175 Specifically, the Report recommended that FSOC: (1) consider any\nfactors that might mitigate the exposure of a firm\u2019s creditors and counterparties to its financial\ndistress; (2) focus on \u201cplausible\u201d (and not merely \u201cpossible\u201d) asset liquidation risks; (3) evaluate\nthe likelihood that a firm will experience financial distress before evaluating how that distress\ncould be transmitted to other firms; (4) consider the benefits and costs of designations; and\n(5) collapse its three-stage review process into two steps, notifying companies that they are under\nactive review during Stage 1 and voting on proposed designations after the completion of Stage\n2.176\nThird, the Treasury Department recommended enhancing engagement between FSOC and\ncompanies under review, and improving the designation process\u2019s transparency.177 Specifically,\nthe report recommended that FSOC: (1) engage earlier with companies under review and \u201cexplain\n... the key risks\u201d that FSOC has identified, (2) \u201cundertake greater engagement\u201d with companies\u2019\nprimary financial regulators, and (3) publicly release explanations of its designation decisions.178\nFourth, the Treasury Department recommended that FSOC provide \u201ca clear off-ramp\u201d for nonbanks designated as systemically important.179 The report recommended that FSOC: (1) highlight\nthe key risks that led to a company\u2019s designation, (2) \u201cadopt a more robust and transparent\nprocess for its annual reevaluations\u201d that \u201cmake[s] clear how companies can engage with FSOC\n... and what information companies should submit during a reevaluation,\u201d (3) \u201cdevelop a process\nto enable a designated company to discuss potential changes it could make to address the risks it\ncould pose to financial stability,\u201d and (4) \u201cmake clear that the standard it applies in its annual\nreevaluations is the same as the standard for an initial designation of a nonbank financial\ncompany.\u201d\n\nUse only the information provided in the text above.

Canada (Attorney General)\n \n\n [49] The issue in Schembri was whether the Commission was bound to take into account the claimant\u2019s financial circumstances when determining the penalty to impose. The claimant in that case had failed to report his earnings and collected unemployment benefits for several months. The Commission had calculated that the claimant had received a benefit overpayment of $4,130, which it sought to recover. It had also assessed a penalty under section 38 of the EIA, because the claimant had received unemployment benefits by knowingly misreporting his income contrary to paragraph 38(1)(c) of the EIA. In determining the amount of penalty payable, the Commission considered the claimant\u2019s gambling addiction and his efforts to deal with it, and reduced the penalty by 25% to $3,097. The Board of Referees later exonerated the claimant from any penalty. The Umpire then found that the Commission had erred when it failed to undertake, on its own initiative, an inquiry into the claimant\u2019s financial circumstances and whether it would cause the claimant undue hardship to pay the proposed penalty. The Umpire reduced the penalty imposed by the Commission from 75% to 10% of the amount of the overpayment.\n \n\n [50] On judicial review, this Court held that the Commission was not required to initiate its own inquiries into a person\u2019s financial circumstances before it imposed a penalty, noting that claimants have ample opportunities to request a reduction of the penalty on the ground of financial hardship at various stages of the process: before the penalty is imposed, on request for reconsideration and on appeal to the Board of Referees (Schembri at para. 14). Since the claimant had not raised the issue with the Commission and the Board of Referees, this Court decided that the Umpire should have held that the Board had no basis to interfere with the penalty.\n \n\n [51] In my view, this Court\u2019s findings in Schembri do not extend to the reconsideration of a claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits. The overpayment in Schembri was not in dispute, only the amount of penalty the claimant would have to pay. Subsection 38(1) of the EIA specifies the acts or omissions for which a claimant may be subject to a penalty and subsection 38(2) sets the maximum penalties the Commission may impose. Under section 41 of the EIA, the Commission may rescind the imposition of a penalty or reduce it, on the presentation of new facts or on being satisfied that the penalty was imposed without knowledge of, or on the basis of a mistake as to, some material fact. Furthermore the Commission may issue, under section 41.1, a warning instead of setting the amount of a penalty for an act or omission under subsections 38(2) and 39(2) of the EIA. The Commission thus enjoys a wide discretion in assessing the amount of penalty and may consider financial hardship to the claimant as a mitigating factor.\n \n\n [52] This is consistent with the Commission\u2019s policy regarding penalties, which mentions financial hardship as a possible mitigating circumstance when determining penalties (Digest of Benefit Entitlement Principles, section 18.5.2.2). It appears from the record that the Commission did not apply a penalty in Ms. Molchan\u2019s case despite her false statements (Applicant\u2019s record at 130, 173, 178).\n \n\n .....\n \n\n [55] In my view, the Appeal Division\u2019s comments regarding Ms. Molchan\u2019s ability to seek a write-off of her debt are consistent with the legislation, which sets out a specific procedure, a write-off, for undue hardship cases. Subparagraph 56(1)(f)(ii) of the Employment Insurance Regulations explicitly provides the Commission with the authority to write off an amount payable under section 43 of the EIA if repayment of the amount due would result in undue hardship to the claimant.\n \n\n [56] That said, I am nonetheless of the view that the Appeal Division was clearly cognizant of and empathetic to the financial hardship to Ms. Molchan in having to repay her debt. Like the General Division, the Appeal Division implored the Commission and the Canada Revenue Agency to consider any request by Ms. Molchan to write off her debt, given the circumstances in which the overpayment arose. The Appeal Division even went as far as providing in a footnote the telephone number where she could call to seek relief.", "full_prompt": "[question]\n There's this case i can't find anything about, Schembri, but it's in this attached text.

Like the General Division, the Appeal Division implored the Commission and the Canada Revenue Agency to consider any request by Ms. Molchan to write off her debt, given the circumstances in which the overpayment arose. The Appeal Division even went as far as providing in a footnote the telephone number where she could call to seek relief.\n http://isthatlegal.ca/index.php?name=EI.penalties\n \n\n =====================\n \n\n [instruction]\n Answer the question using only the information provided in the context.

CASE\r\n\u2022 55-year-old man with history of episodic pain and swelling in the 1st MTP\r\njoints\r\n\u2022 Started allopurinol one week earlier\r\n\u2022 Physical examination showed rock-hard lump on right pina and hot, tender\r\npurplish-blue swelling in the knee and the left midfoot.\r\n\u2022 Serum uric acid concentration 7.8 mg/dl\r\n\u2022 Synovial fluid aspirate contained intracellular needle-shaped crystals with\r\nstrong negative birefringence\r\nTHE FOUR PHASES OF GOUT\r\n1. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia\r\nSerum urate is typically raised (>7 mg/dl for men and >6 mg/dl for women) for 20\r\nyears before the first attack of gouty arthritis or urolithiasis\r\n2. Acute gouty arthritis\r\n\r\nThe first attach usually occurs between the 4th and 6th decades. Onset before the\r\nage of 30 years raises the question of an unusual form of gout, perhaps related to\r\nan enzymatic defect that causes purine overproduction.\r\nPrecipitating factors are antihyperuricemic therapy (probenecid, allopurinol),\r\ndiuretics, IV heparin, cyclosporine, trauma, surgery, alcohol (beer), chronic lead\r\npoisoning, dietary excess, hemorrhage, foreign protein therapy, and infections.\r\nMedical conditions associated with gout are obesity, diabetes mellitus,\r\nhypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, atherosclerosis, syndrome X (resistance to\r\ninsulin-stimulated glucose uptake, hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, and\r\ndyslipoproteinemia with high levels of plasma triglycerides and high-density\r\nlipoprotein cholesterol).\r\nUsually a single joint is affected, and the first metatarsophalangeal joint is the\r\nmost commonly affected site. The attack begins suddenly and is common at\r\nnight. Involvement is usually in the lower extremities. The involved joint\r\nbecomes dusky, red, and swollen. Pain is intense and \u201cthe night is passed in\r\ntorture\u201d.\r\nThe pathogenesis of acute gouty arthritis is centered about the monosodium urate\r\ncrystal, which is always present. Of interest, hyperuricemia is often present but is\r\nnot necessary for the reaction to occur. Urate crystals, which were likely\r\ndeposited in synovium, are thought to \u201cflake off\u201d and initiate an intense\r\ninflammatory response. The crystals become heavily coated with IgG and iron,\r\nboth of which increase their inflammatory potential. Leukocytes are necessary for\r\nthe reaction; almost all of the crystals in an affected joint have been ingested at\r\nthe height of the reaction. The release of lysosomal mediators and the release of\r\nsuperoxide anion contribute to the local inflammation. Many serum factors\r\nmediate the inflammatory response, including complement, fibronectin, IgG, and\r\na number of cytokines among which is transforming growth factor-beta.\r\nLeukocytosis, fever, and high erythrocyte sedimentation rate may accompany the\r\nacute attack. Radiographs are normal in the acute phase.\r\n3. Intercritical gout.\r\n\r\nMost patients will have a second attack 6 \u2013 24 months after the first attack. The\r\nperiod between attacks is known as the intercritical period. Joints appear normal\r\nduring this time.\r\n4. Chronic tophaceous gout.\r\nEventually, patients may enter a phase of chronic polyarticular gout without painfree periods. This may occur 3-42 years after the first attack; the average period\r\nis about 12 years. Tophi are a manifestation of the inability to eliminate urate as\r\nrapidly as it is produced. Urate deposits appear in the cartilage, synovium,\r\ntendons, and soft tissues. A favored location is extensor surfaces and pressure\r\npoints, and the lesions may resemble rheumatoid nodules. In untreated disease,\r\nmassive destruction of joints may occur. Tophi have been reported to resolve\r\nover periods of years in patients who receive probenecid or allopurinol.\r\nE. PRINCIPLES OF THERAPY\r\n1. Asymptomatic hyperuricemia\r\nFirst, consider the multiple causes of secondary hyperuricemia: consider\r\ndrugs, renal insufficiency, myeloproliferative and lymphoproliferative\r\ndiseases, hemolytic anemia, anemias associate with ineffective\r\nerythropoiesis, psoriasis, Paget\u2019s disease of bone, and enzyme defects (see\r\nbelow).\r\nTreatment is not recommended for asymptomatic hyperuricemia.\r\nExceptions to this rule are enzyme defects that lead to lifelong\r\nhyperuricemia. Exceptions to this rule are enzyme defects that lead to\r\nlifelong hyperuricemia (examples: deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine\r\nphosphoribosyltransferase in the Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, partial\r\ndeficiency of HGPRT, superactivity of 5-phosphoribosyl \u2013 1-\r\npyrophosphate) and the hyperuricemia associated with tumor\r\nchemotherapy.\r\n2. Acute gouty arthritis\r\nPrinciples of treating acute gout include use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, colchicines, and corticosteroids. Do not attempt to\r\nreduce plasma urate concentrations in the patient who is experiencing an\r\nacute attack.\r\n1. NONSTEROIDAL ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS\r\nTreatment of acute gouty arthritis is based upon the judicious use of\r\nnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Many of these\r\nagents are effective. Maximum-dose NSAID treatment is started at the\r\nfirst sign of an attack and the dose is lowed within a day or two and\r\ncontinued until the arthritis has resolved. NSAIDS are also effective\r\nin the well-established attack. Indocin (starting dose 50 mg po TID or\r\nQID) is often employed; the dose is tapered to 0 after about 1 week.\r\nRenal insufficiency is a contraindication to this therapy so is active\r\npeptic ulcer disease. Consider a history of bleeding from the upper\r\ngastrointestinal tract when deciding upon therapy for acute gout.\r\nUndesirable side effects of traditional NSAIDS: Gastric/esophageal\r\nirritation, exacerbations of peptic ulcers, anti-platelet effects,\r\nreversible hepatocellular toxicity, decreased creatinine clearance, skin\r\nrashes, aspirin-like reactions in the presence of the rhinitis, nasal\r\npolyposis, and asthma syndrome, and headaches and confusion in the\r\nelderly.\r\nAspirin increases renal retention of uric acid in low doses, whereas\r\nhigh doses (3.5-5.0 gm/day) are uricosuric. It is avoided as an agent to\r\ntreat an acute attack of gout.\r\n2. COLCHICINE\r\nColchicine can be used to treat acute gout, but should be limited to low\r\noral doses or cautious intravenous use (the latter for the hospitalized\r\npatient only). Colchicine should be used in reduced doses or avoided\r\naltogether in the patient with renal insufficiency.\r\nSome clinicians will give a brief course of oral colchicines, 2-3 tablets\r\na week, in geriatric patients or patients with renal insufficiency.\r\nNo patient should receive the traditional high-dose treatment in which\r\nnumerous tablets of colchicines are given by mouth. This therapy can\r\ncause very servere diarrhea and dehydration.\r\nIntravenous administration should be given according to strict\r\nguidelines: (1) Single IV doses should not exceed 1 to 2 mg and the\r\ntotal cumulative dose should not be > 4mg, (2) No additional\r\ncolchicines should be prescribed for 7 days, (3) the dose of IV\r\ncolchicines should be halved in those with creatinine clearance < 50\r\nml/min and in those > 65 years of age in whom the creatinine\r\nclearance is not known.\r\nPatients with renal insufficiency, especially those who are on dialysis,\r\nare at risk of developing colchicine neuromyopathy. This\r\ncomplication is characterized by elevated CPK and muscle weakness.\r\nDiscontinuation of colchicine leads to improvement in the myopathy\r\nover several w3eeks. Associated neuropathy resolves more slowly.\r\n 3. CORTICOSTEROIDS\r\n\r\nIntraarticular corticosteroids are very useful in breaking attacks of\r\nacute gout and have special value when other treatments cannot be\r\nutilized. In some instances, ACTH injections or oral corticosteroids\r\nare required.\r\nF. LONGTERM PROPHYLACTIC TREATMENT\r\na. PROPHLAXIS\r\nProphylaxis of the acute attack can be achieved by administering daily low\r\ndoses of colchicine (0.5 or 0.6 mg tablet by mouth, 1 or 2 times daily; or in the\r\npresence of renal insufficiency, one tablet 3 times per week). An alternate\r\nprophylactic drug is Indocin, 25 mg by mouth twice a day. ALWAYS USE\r\nPROPHYLAXIS WHEN STARTING DRUGS TO LOWER THE\r\nSERUM URIC ACID LEVEL.\r\nb. URICOSURIG THERAPY\r\nUricosuric agents facilitate urate excretion by the kidney and increase urate\r\nclearance and the fractional excretion of filtered urate. Probenecid is the most\r\ncommonly used drug in this class. It is started at a dose of 0.5 gm/.day, and\r\nthe dose is increased gradually to 1 \u2013 3 gm/day, given in 2-3 divided doses.\r\nRenal insufficiency and a history of nephrolithiasis are contraindications to\r\nuricosuric treatment.\r\n\r\nc. XANTHINE OXIDASE INHIBITION\r\nThe xanthine oxidase inhibitor, allopurinol, is used long-term to lower serum\r\nuric acid. It is indicated in overproduction of urate (examples: 24 hour urine\r\nuric acid >0.8 gm while on a normal diet; enzyme defect that leads to lifelong\r\noverproduction such as deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase), Tophi, renal insufficiency, nephrolithiasis, or intolerance to\r\nuricosuric agents.\r\nAllopurinol can paradoxically initiate acute polyarticular gout. For this\r\nreason, it should never be used in the patient who is experiencing acute gouty\r\narthritis. Remember to start prophylactic treatment and to continue it for at\r\nleast 6 weeks when allopurinol is started.\r\nThe dose of allopurinol should be adjusted according to the patient\u2019s renal\r\nfunction. The nomogram for maintenance allopurinol, adapted from Am J\r\nMed 76:43, 1984, is:\r\n CCr 0, 100 mg every 3 days; CCr 10, 100 mg every 2 days;\r\n CCR 20, 100 mg/day; CCR 40, 150 mg/day; CCr 60, 200 mg/day\r\n CCr 80, 250 mg/day; CCr 100, 300 mg/day; CCr 120, 350 mg/day\r\n CCr 140, 400 mg/day\r\nThe risk in using allopurinol in renal insufficiency is the allopurinol\r\nhypersensitivity syndrome. Use of diuretics is also a risk factor. The\r\nsyndrome develops within 2 \u2013 4 weeks of starting allopurinol and mortality is\r\n20%. It is characterized by skin rash, fever hepatocellular injury,\r\nLeukocytosis, eosinophilia, and worsening renal function.\r\nAlso, be aware that allopurinol causes potentiation of azathioprine, which as a\r\npurine analogue is metabolized by xanthine oxidase. The use of allopurinol\r\nrequires a 50 to 75% reduction in the azathioprine dose. Careful monitoring\r\nof the leukocyte count is required; the margin between leucopenia and\r\ninadequate immunosuppression is narrow.\r\nII. PSEUDEOGOUT\r\nPseudogout refers to articular disease associated with calcium pyrophosphate\r\ndehydrate crystals in synovial fluid or synovium. It is often associated with\r\nchondrocalcinosis, a radiographic finding in which calcium-containing crystals\r\nare visualized in fibrocartilage or articular cartilage. It is discussed here because\r\nsome clinical features resemble gout. Differentiation from grout is important; the\r\nPseudogout patient should not receive allopurinol.\r\nPseudogout can occur as a hereditary disease, as a sporadic disease, or as a\r\ncondition that is associated with metabolic diseases or trauma. The hereditary\r\ndisease usually shows an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Pseudogout\r\nis clearly associated with OLD AGE, and associations with hyperparathyroidism,\r\nhemochromatosis, hypothyroidism, amyloidosis, hypomagnesemia, and\r\nhypophosphatasia have been reported.\r\nThe manifestations of Pseudogout are:\r\n1. Acute inflammation in one or more joints lasting for several days to 2\r\nweeks. Joints commonly involved are: knees (50%), wrists, and\r\nshoulders. As with gout, the attacks can occur spontaneously or be\r\nprovoked by trauma, surgery or severe illness.\r\n2. About one half of these patients have progressive degeneration of\r\n numerous joints, and acute flares of arthritis may be superimposed on\r\n the degenerative problem.\r\n3. About 50% of patients have pseudo-rheumatoid presentation with\r\n multiple joint involvement. Rheumatoid factor is present in 10% of\r\n these patients, leading to confusion with rheumatoid arthritis.\r\n", "full_prompt": "GOUT\r\nA. GOALS\r\n 1.

Fortunately, taking time off work for maternity leave can\r\ngive a new mother the chance to heal both physically and emotionally, as well as\r\nsufficient time to bond with and care for her newborn baby.\r\nCountless studies and research show that adequate paid maternity leave has a host of\r\nbenefits for mother, baby and the entire family, such as decreased rehospitalization\r\nrates for both mother and baby, improved stress management and more consistent\r\nexercise.\r\nHowever, paid maternity leave is lacking in the U.S., which affects mothers, children\r\nand families. Read on to learn more about maternity leave, including the landscape of\r\nmaternity leave in the U.S. and how maternity leave affects a person\u2019s mental and\r\nphysical health after childbirth.\r\nWhat Is Maternity Leave?\r\nMaternity leave is the time a mother takes off from work after having a baby. It\u2019s\r\ngenerally a time for them to recover from childbirth and adjust to life with a newborn\r\nbaby. However, maternity leave in the U.S. isn\u2019t standardized, which can make it\r\ndifficult to define.\r\n\u201cThe definition and scope of maternity leave and the mechanics of taking leave vary\r\nfrom organization to organization,\u201d says Shayla Thurlow, vice president of people and\r\ntalent acquisition at The Muse who has developed and administered parental leave\r\nprograms for large and small organizations across various industries.\r\nHow Does Maternity Leave Work?\r\nThe U.S. is one of the few industrialized countries worldwide that doesn\u2019t mandate paid\r\nparental leave. Maternity leave is meant to be a time for a mother to give all her focus\r\nand attention to her newborn baby, her health and her family, but the length of leave\u2014\r\nand whether it\u2019s paid and to what extent\u2014varies based on a number of factors, including\r\nwhere you work, how long you\u2019ve worked for your employer the number of employees\r\nthey have.\r\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) guarantees coverage for 12 workweeks of\r\nunpaid leave per year for qualifying family and medical reasons, including the birth of a\r\nbaby, adoption or foster care placement, or when you or an immediate family member\r\nare seriously ill and in need of care. However, FMLA doesn\u2019t cover all employees.\r\nEmployers with at least 50 employees must allow parents 12 weeks of job-protected\r\nleave to care for their newborn, but pay during this time is not guaranteed, according to\r\nthe International Labour Organization.\r\nTo qualify for FMLA coverage:\r\n\u2022 You must work for a covered employer, including any public agency, any public\r\nor private elementary or secondary school, or a private employer with at least 50\r\nemployees within a 75-mile radius.\r\n\u2022 You must have worked at the company for at least 12 months.\r\n\u2022 You must have worked at least 1,250 hours for the company in the 12 months\r\nbefore your leave.\r\nMany new mothers take less than 12 weeks of maternity leave for various reasons,\r\nincluding (but not limited to) working for a company that doesn\u2019t offer FMLA coverage\r\nand/or being unable to afford being out of work for that long. A 2014 analysis in\r\nMaternal and Child Health Journal found 41% of employed women in the U.S. received\r\npaid maternity leave for an average of three weeks, with only a 31% wage replacement.\r\nThe research also noted that, on average, new mothers took 10 weeks of maternity leave,\r\nand the majority of women didn\u2019t receive any compensation for that time away from\r\nwork[1].\r\nAs Thurlow points out, some states require paid maternity leave, but it\u2019s usually up to\r\nthe employer to decide whether to provide paid maternity leave for its employees.\r\n\u201cThough 12 weeks of unpaid leave is covered by federal law [in certain cases], many\r\nfamilies are not in a financial position to use that time [without pay] and may be unable\r\nto have a long maternity leave,\u201d she says.\r\nMaternity Leave Trends in the U.S.\r\nThe U.S. is lacking when it comes to maternity leave benefits. Most adults don\u2019t have\r\naccess to paid family leave through their employers, according to a 2021 survey\r\nconducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Furthermore, a 2019 Pew Research\r\nCenter study of 41 nations found the U.S. is the only country that doesn\u2019t mandate any\r\npaid leave for new parents. Among the other 40 nations, the smallest amount of paid\r\nmaternity leave is two months in Ireland while Estonia offers more than a year and a\r\nhalf of paid parental leave[2].\r\nWorldwide, very few countries don\u2019t guarantee paid maternity leave; instead, more than\r\n120 countries offer paid maternity leave and health benefits by law. At the lower end of\r\nthe spectrum, only 33 countries mandate maternity leave that lasts less than 12 weeks.\r\nMeanwhile, as of 2021 in the U.S., only nine states and the District of Columbia have\r\ninstituted some degree of paid parental leave.\r\nHow Can Maternity Leave Impact Your Health?\r\nTaking maternity leave is essential not only for the health of the newborn, but also for\r\nthe health of the mother. \u201cMaternity leave [or the 12 weeks after birth] is often referred\r\nto as the fourth trimester,\u201d says Suzanne Bovone, M.D., an OBGYN at Obstetrics and\r\nGynecology of San Jose, part of the Pediatrix Medical Group in Campbell, California.\r\n\u201cAs each trimester of pregnancy brought changes for the woman and baby, the period\r\nafter delivery is a continuation of change. Inadequate maternity leave can lead not only\r\nto anxiety and depression, but also relationship issues and the inability to return to\r\nwork.\u201d\r\nMore than 12 weeks is needed for an adequate maternity leave, according to Dr. Bovone.\r\n\u201cMany issues that need assistance are not even apparent until three to four months after\r\ndelivery,\u201d she says. \u201cIt almost becomes impossible to juggle the demands of self-care,\r\nchildcare, relationships and work obligations.\u201d\r\nAccording to Dr. Bovone, some complications of the side effects of the postpartum\r\nperiod may include:\r\n\u2022 Sleep deprivation\r\n\u2022 Increased stress levels\r\n\u2022 Loss of coping mechanisms\r\n\u2022 Inability to think clearly and ask for help\r\n\u2022 Negative thoughts and feelings\r\n\u2022 Pelvic floor issues\r\n\u2022 Impact on urinary and bowel function\r\n\u2022 Negative impact on sexual health\r\n\u201cIt may take months for one to recognize areas that need work,\u201d she adds.\r\n\u201cUnfortunately, with limited maternity leave, many [parents] cannot find the time to\r\nprovide adequate self-care when they\u2019re back at work.\u201d\r\nPhysical Health\r\nThe body goes through major physical changes after having a baby, from pelvic floor\r\ndisruption to urinary and bowel dysfunction. \u201cJust as pregnancy physically changes\r\none\u2019s body over [more than] nine months, [recovery during] the postpartum period\r\ntakes just as long,\u201d says Dr. Bovone. \u201cMaternity leave is a time for the woman to rest and\r\nrecover.\u201d\r\nResearch shows the positive effect maternity leave has on physical health. For instance,\r\na study in the American Economic Journal: Economic Policy observing health data on\r\nmothers in Norway both before and after paid maternity leave became mandated by law\r\nin 1977 found women who gave birth after 1977 experienced better overall health as they\r\napproached middle age. This improvement was particularly noticeable among women\r\nwho worked low-income jobs and wouldn\u2019t have taken unpaid leave previously\u2014they\r\nwere less likely to smoke or experience high blood pressure, had lower BMIs and were\r\nmore likely to exercise regularly[3].\r\nPaid maternity leave can also contribute to decreased infant mortality, as well as mother\r\nand infant rehospitalizations, according to a 2020 review in the Harvard Review of\r\nPsychiatry, which also found paid maternity leave to be associated with an increase in\r\npediatric visit attendance and timely administration of infant immunizations[4]. A 2018\r\nstudy in Maternal and Child Health Journal found similar results: Women who took paid\r\nmaternity leave experienced a 47% decrease in the odds of rehospitalization for their\r\ninfants and a 51% decrease in the odds of being rehospitalized themselves at 21 months\r\npostpartum[5].\r\nThe 2020 review in the Harvard Review of Psychiatry also found paid maternity leave can\r\nlead to an increase in the initiation and duration of breastfeeding.\r\nPaid maternity leave may lead to healthier habits as well. The 2018 study in Maternal\r\nand Child Health Journalalso found women who took paid maternity leave were nearly\r\ntwice as likely to exercise and were able to better manage their stress levels compared to\r\nthose who didn\u2019t take paid maternity leave.\r\nMental Health\r\nMaternity leave has a significant impact on mental health as well. \u201cThere are huge\r\nadjustments that come with a new baby,\u201d says Thurlow. \u201cChanges in family dynamics,\r\nsleep deprivation and bonding with a new baby create mental and emotional strains for\r\nnew parents. The ability to take time off to adjust and create a new normal has proven\r\nbeneficial for parents\u2019 overall mental and emotional well-being.\u201d\r\nResearch shows a positive correlation between mental health and paid maternity leave\r\nas well. According to the same 2020 review in the Harvard Review of Psychology, paid\r\nmaternity leave is associated with a decrease in postpartum maternal depression.\r\nMeanwhile, a 2012 study in the Journal of Mental Health Policies and Economicsfound\r\nhaving fewer than 12 weeks of maternity leave and fewer than eight weeks of paid\r\nmaternity leave to be associated with increases in depressive symptoms[6]. And the\r\nlonger the leave, the better: Longer paid maternity leaves are associated with decreased\r\ndepressive symptoms until six months postpartum, according to a 2014 study in\r\nthe Journal of Health Politics, Policy and Law[7].\r\nMaternity leave can also mean less stress for postpartum mothers, which can trickle\r\ndown in a positive way to affect family dynamics and relationships as well. A 2013 study\r\nin the Journal of Family Issues observed Australian two-parent families and found the\r\nlength of maternity leave affected a mother\u2019s mental health, quality of parenting and the\r\ncouple\u2019s relationship. What\u2019s more, mothers who took more than 13 weeks of paid leave\r\nexperienced significantly less psychological distress[8].\r\nThe positive effects of maternity leave aren\u2019t just apparent immediately after a baby is\r\nborn: Maternity leave can lead to better mental health later in life as well. A 2015 study\r\nin Social Science and Medicine using European data found longer maternity leaves to be\r\nassociated with improved mental health in old age[9].\r\nEmotional Health\r\nA mother\u2019s emotional health can be influenced by maternity leave as well. Postpartum\r\nemotional health involves identity changes that go along with becoming a parent, says\r\nDr. Bovone. \u201cOur self-identity changes, as well as our relationships and interactions\r\nwith our partners, families and friends,\u201d she adds.\r\nNew mothers may find it difficult to ask for help, and some may find being a parent isn\u2019t\r\nwhat they thought it would be. \u201cPriorities may change as well, and some struggle with\r\nthis new perspective,\u201d says Dr. Bovone.\r\nFortunately, maternity leave can lead to better bonding experiences between mother\r\nand child. A 2018 study of 3,850 mothers in the U.S. found a significant correlation\r\nbetween the duration of paid maternity leave and positive mother-child interactions,\r\nsuch as secure attachment and empathy[10].\r\nA decreased chance of domestic violence is also associated with paid parental leave. A\r\n2019 study in Preventive Medicine found paid parental leave can be an effective strategy\r\nto prevent future instances of intimate partner violence. This connection could exist\r\nbecause paid leaves maintains household income and prevents financial stressors,\r\nincreases gender equity (which is associated with less intimate partner violence against\r\nwomen) and gives parents time to bond with a child without having to worry about\r\nwork[11].\r\nWhat Experts Say About Maternity Leave\r\nDr. Bovone and Thurlow both agree that adequate paid maternity leave is a necessity for\r\nthe health and well-being of mothers, children and families as a whole.\r\nWhat\u2019s more, maternity leave should be longer than what\u2019s typically offered, according\r\nto Dr. Bovone. \u201cIdeally, a year to care for oneself and the newborn is needed,\u201d she says.\r\n\u201cCoverage for breastfeeding issues, mental and emotional health, pelvic floor health and\r\nsexual health should be the norm and accessible to all. The American College of\r\nObstetricians and Gynecologists supports the expansion of postpartum services, but the\r\ncurrent medical system at OBGYN offices doesn\u2019t allow adequate time nor payment for\r\nthese services.\u201d She stresses the importance of improved maternity leave, saying that not\r\nonly is it beneficial to mothers, but also to families, communities and, ultimately, work\r\nenvironments.\r\nThurlow believes maternity leave should be a minimum of 12 weeks, paid and federally\r\nmandated for all employers. \u201cMaternity leave is good, but organizations should provide\r\npaid parental leave to truly support parents,\u201d she says.\r\nShe adds that maternity leave needs to be expanded. \u201cProviding paid leave to a birthing\r\nparent shouldn\u2019t be a discussion, but the issue is much larger. Only providing paid leave\r\nto a birthing parent doesn\u2019t take into account families that are made whole by adoption,\r\nsurrogacy or the placement of a child.

Some of FTX\u2019s largest investors immediately wrote their FTX investments down to\n$0. More than a million creditors (including individuals and institutions) are caught up in this FTX\ninsolvency. This Insight uses the FTX event as a case study to illustrate the Securities and Exchange\nCommission\u2019s (SEC\u2019s) regulatory jurisdiction, how it applies to crypto-assets, and perceived weaknesses\nin the application of the current regulatory framework.\nSEC Investigation of FTX\nThe SEC and dozens of other federal, state, and international regulatory agencies and prosecutors have\nengaged with FTX to obtain more information. The SEC generally does not publicly disclose information\nregarding ongoing investigations. But multiple news sources have reported that the SEC has been\ninvestigating FTX.US, FTX\u2019s U.S. subsidiary, for months. While FTX is based overseas and reportedly\nseeks to block U.S. customers to potentially avoid U.S. jurisdiction, FTX.US provides narrower product\noffers and is tailored for the U.S. market, and it maintains several U.S. regulatory licenses.\nSince the FTX crash, the SEC has reportedly expanded its investigation toward FTX and Alameda\nResearch, an FTX-affiliated investment management firm. At issue is whether FTX and its affiliates are\ninvolved in certain securities-related activities, which should have been registered with the SEC (or\nreceived an exemption) before being sold to investors.

This study\nexplores meaning which patients with false-positive or imitated DID attributed to their\ndiagnosis. 85 people who reported elevated levels of dissociative symptoms in SDQ20 participated in clinical assessment using the Trauma and Dissociation Symptoms\nInterview, followed by a psychiatric interview. The recordings of six women, whose\nearlier DID diagnosis was disconfirmed, were transcribed and subjected to interpretative\nphenomenological analysis. Five main themes were identified: (1) endorsement and\nidentification with the diagnosis. (2) The notion of dissociative parts justifies identity\nconfusion and conflicting ego-states. (3) Gaining knowledge about DID affects the\nclinical presentation. (4) Fragmented personality becomes an important discussion\ntopic with others. (5) Ruling out DID leads to disappointment or anger. To avoid\nmisdiagnoses, clinicians should receive more systematic training in the assessment\nof dissociative disorders, enabling them to better understand subtle differences in the\nquality of symptoms and how dissociative and non-dissociative patients report them.\nThis would lead to a better understanding of how patients with and without a dissociative\ndisorder report core dissociative symptoms. Some guidelines for a differential diagnosis\nare provided.\nKeywords: dissociative identity disorder (DID), false-positive cases, personality disorder, dissociation, differential\ndiagnosis\n\nINTRODUCTION\nMultiple Personality Disorder (MPD) was first introduced in DSM-III in 1980 and re-named\nDissociative Identity Disorder (DID) in subsequent editions of the diagnostic manual (American\nPsychiatric Association, 2013). Table 1 shows diagnostic criteria of this disorder in ICD-10, ICD11, and DSM-5. Some healthcare providers perceive it as fairly uncommon or associated with\ntemporary trends (Brand et al., 2016). Even its description in ICD-10 (World Health Organization,\n1993) starts with: \u201cThis disorder is rare, and controversy exists about the extent to which it is\niatrogenic or culture-specific\u201d (p. 160). Yet, according to the guidelines of the International Society\nfor the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (International Society for the Study of Trauma and\nDissociation, 2011), the prevalence of DID in the general population is estimated between 1 and\n3%. The review of global studies on DID in clinical settings by Sar (2011) shows the rate from\n\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n1\n\nMay 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 637929\n\n\fPietkiewicz et al.\n\nRevisiting False-Positive and Imitated DID\n\nTABLE 1 | Diagnostic criteria for dissociative identity disorder.\nICD-10 Multiple personality disorder F44.81\n(A) Two or more distinct personalities exist within the individual, only one being evident at a time.\n(B) Each personality has its own memories, preferences, and behavior patterns, and at some time (and recurrently) takes full control of the individual\u2019s behavior.\n(C) There is inability to recall important personal information which is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness.\n(D) The symptoms are not due to organic mental disorders (F00\u2013F09) (e.g., in epileptic disorders) or to psychoactive substance-related disorders (F10\u2013F19)\n(e.g.,\nintoxication or withdrawal).\nICD-11 Dissociative identity disorder 6B64\nDissociative identity disorder is characterized by disruption of identity in which there are two or more distinct personality states (dissociative identities) associated with\nmarked discontinuities in the sense of self and agency. Each personality state includes its own pattern of experiencing, perceiving, conceiving, and relating to self, the\nbody, and the environment. At least two distinct personality states recurrently take executive control of the individual\u2019s consciousness and functioning in interacting with\nothers or with the environment, such as in the performance of specific aspects of daily life such as parenting, or work, or in response to specific situations (e.g., those\nthat are perceived as threatening). Changes in personality state are accompanied by related alterations in sensation, perception, affect, cognition, memory, motor\ncontrol, and behavior. There are typically episodes of amnesia, which may be severe. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental, behavioral or\nneurodevelopmental disorder and are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects, and are not\ndue to a disease of the nervous system or a sleep-wake disorder. The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or\nother important areas of functioning.\nDSM-5 Dissociative identity disorder 300.14\n(A) Disruption of identity characterized by two or more distinct personality states, which may be described in some cultures as an experience of possession. The\ndisruption in identity involves marked discontinuity in sense of self and sense of agency accompanied by related alterations in affect, behavior, consciousness,\nmemory, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. These signs and symptoms may be observed by others or reported by the individual.\n(B) Recurrent gaps in the recall of everyday events, important personal information, and/or traumatic events that are inconsistent with ordinary forgetting.\n(C) The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\n(D) The disturbance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious practice. Note: In children, the symptoms are not better explained by imaginary\nplaymates or other fantasy play.\n(E) The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts or chaotic behavior during alcohol intoxication) or another medical\ncondition (e.g., complex partial seizures).\n\na false positive diagnosis, which is unfavorable for the patient,\nbecause using treatment developed for DID with patients\nwithout autonomous dissociative parts may be inefficient or even\nreinforce their pathology.\nAuthors who wrote about patients inappropriately diagnosed\nwith this disorder used terms such as \u2018malingering\u2019 or \u2018factitious\u2019\nDID (Coons and Milstein, 1994; Thomas, 2001). According\nto Draijer and Boon (1999), both labels imply that patients\nintentionally simulate symptoms, either for external gains\n(financial benefits or justification for one\u2019s actions in court) or\nfor other forms of gratification (e.g., interest from others), while\nin many cases their motivation is not fully conscious. Getting\na DID diagnosis can also provide structure for inner chaos and\nincomprehensible experiences, and be associated with hope and\nbelief it is real. On the other hand, diagnostic errors often result\nin inappropriate treatment plans and procedures.\nAlready in 1995 Boon and Draijer stressed that a growing\nnumber of people self-diagnosed themselves based on\ninformation from literature and the Internet, and reported\nsymptoms by the book during psychiatric or psychological\nassessment. Based on their observation of 36 patients in whom\nDID had been ruled out after applying the structured clinical\ninterview SCID-D, these clinicians identified differences between\ngenuine and imitated DID. They classified their participants into\nthree groups: (1) borderline personality disorder, (2) histrionic\npersonality disorder, or (3) persons with severe dissociative\nsymptoms but not DID. Participants in that study reported\nsymptoms similar to DID patients, including: amnesia (but only\nfor unacceptable behavior), depersonalisation, derealisation,\nidentity confusion, and identity alteration. However, they\npresented themselves and interacted with the therapist in very\n\n0.4 to 14%. However, in studies using clinical diagnostic\ninterviews among psychiatric in-patients, and in European\nstudies these numbers were lower (Friedl et al., 2000). The\ndiscrepancies apparently depend on the sample, the methodology\nand diagnostic interviews used by researchers.\nDiagnosing complex dissociative disorders (DID or Other\nSpecified Dissociative Disorder, OSDD) is challenging for several\nreasons. Firstly, patients present a lot of avoidance and rarely\nreport dissociative symptoms spontaneously without direct\nquestioning (Boon and Draijer, 1993; International Society for\nthe Study of Trauma and Dissociation, 2011; Dorahy et al.,\n2014). In addition, standard mental state examination does not\ninclude these symptoms and healthcare professionals do not\nreceive appropriate training in diagnosing dissociative disorders\n(Leonard et al., 2005). Secondly, complex dissociative disorders\nare polysymptomatic, and specialists would rather diagnose these\npatients with disorders more familiar to them from clinical\npractice, e.g., anxiety disorders, eating disorders, schizophrenia,\nor borderline personality disorder (Boon and Draijer, 1995; Dell,\n2006; Brand et al., 2016). For these reasons, complex dissociative\ndisorders are underdiagnosed and often mis-diagnosed. For\nexample, 26.5\u201340.8% of DID patients would already have been\ndiagnosed and treated for schizophrenia (Putnam et al., 1986;\nRoss et al., 1989). On the other hand, because there is so much\ninformation about DID in the media (Hollywood productions,\ninterviews and testimonies published on YouTube, blogs), people\nwho are confused about themselves and try to find an accurate\ndiagnosis for themselves may learn about DID symptoms on the\nInternet, identify themselves with the disorder, and later (even\nunintentionally) report core symptoms in a very convincing\nway (Draijer and Boon, 1999). This presents a risk of making\n\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n2\n\nMay 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 637929\n\n\fPietkiewicz et al.\n\nRevisiting False-Positive and Imitated DID\n\ndifferent ways. While DID patients are usually reluctant to\ntalk about their symptoms and experience their intrusions as\nshameful, people who imitated DID were eager to present their\nproblems, sometimes in an exaggerated way, in an attempt to\nconvince the clinician that they suffered from DID (Boon and\nDraijer, 1995; Draijer and Boon, 1999). Similar observations\nwere expressed by Thomas (2001) saying that people with\nimitated DID can present their history chronologically, using\nthe first person even when they are highly distressed or allegedly\npresenting an altered personality, and are comfortable with\ndisclosing information about experiences of abuse. They can\ntalk about intrusions of dissociative parts, hearing voices or\ndifficulties controlling emotions, without shame.\nUnfortunately, ICD-10, ICD-11, and DSM-5 offer no specific\nguidelines on how to differentiate patients with personality\ndisorders and dissociative disorders by the manner in which\nthey report symptoms. There are also limited instruments to\ndistinguish between false-positive and false-negative DID. From\nthe clinical perspective, it is also crucial to understand the motives\nfor being diagnosed with DID, and disappointment when this\ndiagnosis is disconfirmed. Accurate assessment can contribute to\ndeveloping appropriate psychotherapeutic procedures (Boon and\nDraijer, 1995; Draijer and Boon, 1999). Apart from observations\nalready referred to earlier in this article, there are no qualitative\nanalyses of false-positive DID cases in the past 20 years.\nMost research was quantitative and compared DID patients\nand simulators in terms of cognitive functions (Boysen and\nVanBergen, 2014). This interpretative phenomenological analysis\nis an idiographic study which explores personal experiences and\nmeaning attributed to conflicting emotions and behaviors in\nsix women who had previously been diagnosed with DID and\nreferred to the Research Centre for Trauma and Dissociation for\nre-evaluation. It explores how they came to believe they have DID\nand what had led clinicians to assume that these patients could be\nsuffering from this disorder.\n\nProcedure\nThis study is part of a larger project examining alterations\nin consciousness and dissociative symptoms in clinical and\nnon-clinical groups, held at the Research Centre for Trauma\n& Dissociation, financed by the National Science Centre, and\napproved by the Ethical Review Board at the SWPS University\nof Social Sciences & Humanities. Potential candidates enrolled\nthemselves or were registered by healthcare providers via an\napplication integrated with the website www.e-psyche.eu. They\nfilled in demographic information and completed online tests,\nincluding: Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire (SDQ-20,\nPietkiewicz et al., 2018) and Trauma Experiences Checklist\n(Nijenhuis et al., 2002). Those with elevated SDQ-20 scores\n(above 28 points) or those referred for differential diagnosis were\nconsulted and if dissociative symptoms were confirmed, they\nwere invited to participate in an in-depth clinical assessment\nincluding a series of interviews, video-recorded and performed at\nthe researcher\u2019s office by the first author who is a psychotherapist\nand supervisor experienced in the dissociation field. In Poland,\nthere are no gold standards for diagnosing dissociative disorders.\nThe first interview was semi-structured, open-ended and\nexplored the patient\u2019s history, main complaints and motives for\nparticipation. It included questions such as: What made you\nparticipate in this study? What are your main difficulties or\nsymptoms in daily life? What do you think caused them? Further\nquestions were then asked to explore participants\u2019 experiences\nand meaning-making. This was followed by the Trauma and\nDissociation Symptoms Interview (TADS-I, Boon and Matthess,\n2017). The TADS-I is a new semi-structured interview intended\nto identify DSM-5 and ICD-11 dissociative disorders. The\nTADS-I differs in several ways from other semi-structured\ninterviews for the assessment of dissociative disorders. Firstly,\nit includes a significant section on somatoform dissociative\nsymptoms. Secondly, it includes a section addressing other\ntrauma-related symptoms for several reasons: (1) to obtain a\nmore comprehensive clinical picture of possible comorbidities,\nincluding symptoms of PTSD and complex PTSD, (2) to gain\na better insight into the (possible) dissociative organization of\nthe personality: patient\u2019s dissociative parts hold many of these\ncomorbid symptoms and amnesia, voices or depersonalisation\nexperiences are often associated with these symptoms; and (3)\nto better distinguish between complex dissociative disorders,\npersonality disorders and other Axis I disorders and false positive\nDID. Finally, the TADS-I also aims to distinguish between\nsymptoms of pathological dissociation indicating a division of\nthe personality and symptoms which are related to a narrowing\nor a lowering of consciousness, and not to the structural\ndissociation of the personality. Validation testing of the TADS-I\nis currently underway. TADS interviews ranging from 2 to 4 h\nwere usually held in sessions of 90 min. Interview recordings\nwere assessed by three healthcare professionals experienced in\nthe dissociation field, who discussed each case and consensually\ncame up with a diagnosis based on ICD-10. An additional mental\nstate examination was performed by the third author who is\na psychiatrist, also experienced in the differential diagnosis of\ndissociative disorders. He collected medical data, double-checked\nthe most important symptoms, communicated the results and\ndiscussed treatment indications. Qualitative data collected from\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis study was carried out in Poland in 2018 and\n2019. Rich qualitative material collected during in-depth\nclinical assessments was subjected to the interpretative\nphenomenological analysis (IPA), a popular methodological\nframework in psychology for exploring people\u2019s personal\nexperiences and interpretations of phenomena (Smith and\nOsborn, 2008). IPA was selected to build a deeper understanding\nof how patients who endorsed and identified with dissociative\nidentity disorder made sense of the diagnosis and what\nit meant for them to be classified as false-positive cases\nduring reassessment.\nInterpretative\nphenomenological\nanalysis\nuses\nphenomenological, hermeneutic, and idiographic principles. It\nemploys \u2018double hermeneutics,\u2019 in which participants share their\nexperiences and interpretations, followed by researchers trying\nto make sense and comment on these interpretations. IPA uses\nsmall, homogenous, purposefully selected samples, and data\nare carefully analyzed case-by-case (Smith and Osborn, 2008;\nPietkiewicz and Smith, 2014).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n3\n\nMay 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 637929\n\n\fPietkiewicz et al.\n\nRevisiting False-Positive and Imitated DID\n\nwho also developed the TADS-I. They are all mentors and\ntrainers of the European Society for Trauma and Dissociation,\nwith significant expertise in the assessment of post-traumatic\nconditions. The first co-investigator (AB) has a master\u2019s degree in\npsychology and is a Ph.D. candidate. She is also a psychotherapist\nin training. All authors coded and discussed their understanding\nof data. Their understanding and interpretations of symptoms\nreported by participants were influenced by their background\nknowledge and experience in diagnosing and treating patients\nwith personality disorders and dissociative disorders.\n\nsix patients out of 85 were selected for this interpretative\nphenomenological analysis, based on the following criteria for\ninclusion, which could ensure a homogenous sample expected of\nIPA studies \u2013 (a) female, (b) previously diagnosed or referred to\nrule in/out DID, (c) endorsement and identification with DID, (d)\ndissociative disorder disconfirmed in the assessment. Interviews\nwith every participant in this study ranged from 3 h 15 min to 7 h\n20 min (mean: 6 h).\n\nParticipants\nParticipants of this IPA were six female patients aged between\n22 and 42 years who were selected out of 86 people examined\nin a larger study exploring dissociation and alterations in\nconsciousness in clinical and non-clinical groups. (Participants\nin the larger study met criteria of different diagnoses and\nseven among them had \u2018genuine\u2019 DID). These six patients did\nnot meet DID criteria on the TADS-I interview but believed\nthemselves that they qualified for that diagnosis. Four of them\nhad higher education, two were secondary school graduates.\nAll of them registered in the study by themselves hoping to\nconfirm their diagnosis but two (Olga and Katia) were referred\nby psychiatrists, and the others by psychotherapists. All of them\ntraveled from far away, which showed their strong motivation\nto participate in the assessment. Four had previously had\npsychiatric treatment and five had been in psychotherapy due\nto problems with emotional regulation and relationships. In\nthe cases of Victoria and Dominique, psychotherapy involved\nworking with dissociative parts. None of them recalled any\nphysical or sexual abuse, but three (Dominique, Victoria, and\nMary), following therapists\u2019 suggestions, were trying to seek\nsuch traumatic memories to justify their diagnosis. They all felt\nemotionally neglected by carriers in childhood and emotionally\nabused by significant others. None of them reported symptoms\nindicating the existence of autonomous dissociative parts.\nNone had symptoms indicating amnesia for daily events, but\nfour declared not remembering single situations associated\nwith conflicting emotions, shame, guilt, or conversations\nduring which they were more focused on internal experiences\nrather than their interlocutors. None experienced PTSD\nsymptoms (e.g., intrusive traumatic memories and avoidance),\nautoscopic phenomena (e.g., out-of-body experiences), or\nclinically significant somatoform symptoms. None had\nauditory verbal hallucinations but four intensely engaged in\ndaydreaming and experienced imagined conversations as very\nreal. All of them had been seeking information about DID\nin literature and the Internet. For more information about\nthem see Table 2. Their names have been changed to protect\ntheir confidentiality.\n\nData Analysis\nVerbatim transcriptions were made of all video recordings, which\nwere analyzed together with researchers\u2019 notes using qualitative\ndata-analysis software \u2013 NVivo11. Consecutive analytical steps\nrecommended for IPA were employed in the study (Pietkiewicz\nand Smith, 2014). For each interview, researchers watched\nthe recording and carefully read the transcript several times.\nThey individually made notes about body language, facial\nexpressions, the content and language use, and wrote down\ntheir interpretative comments using the \u2018annotation\u2019 feature\nin NVivo10. Next, they categorized their notes into emergent\nthemes by allocating descriptive labels (nodes). The team then\ncompared and discussed their coding and interpretations. They\nanalyzed connections between themes in each interview and\nbetween cases, and grouped themes according to conceptual\nsimilarities into main themes and sub-themes.\n\nCredibility Checks\nDuring each interview, participants were encouraged to give\nexamples illustrating reported symptoms or experiences.\nClarification questions were asked to negotiate the meaning\nparticipants wanted to convey. At the end of the interview,\nthey were also asked questions to check that their responses\nwere thorough. The researchers discussed each case thoroughly\nand also compared their interpretative notes to compare\ntheir understanding of the content and its meaning (the\nsecond hermeneutics).\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants in this study explained how they concluded they\nwere suffering from DID, developed knowledge about the\nsyndrome and an identity of a DID patient, and how this affected\ntheir everyday life and relationships. Five salient themes appeared\nin all interviews, as listed in Table 3. Each theme is discussed\nand illustrated with verbatim excerpts from the interviews, in\naccordance with IPA principles.\n\nThe Researchers\n\nTheme 1: Endorsement and\nIdentification With the Diagnosis\n\nThe principal investigator (IJP) is a psychotherapist, supervisor,\nand researcher in the field of community health psychology\nand clinical psychology.

It was like being under control of an alien force. I started\nreading about borderline and I thought I had it. I found a webpage\nabout that and told my mother I should see a psychiatrist. I went\nfor a consultation and told her my story. This lady said: \u201cChild,\nyou don\u2019t have borderline, but multiple personality.\u201d She wanted\nto keep me in the psychiatric unit but I did not agree to stay for\nobservation. (Dominique).\n\nTABLE 3 | Salient themes identified during the interpretative\nphenomenological analysis.\nTheme 1:\n\nEndorsement and identification with the diagnosis\n\nTheme 2:\n\nUsing the notion of dissociative parts to justify identity confusion\nand conflicting ego-states\n\nTheme 3:\n\nGaining knowledge about DID affects the clinical presentation\n\nTheme 4:\n\nFragmented personality becomes an important discussion topic\nwith others\n\nTheme 5:\n\nRuling out DID leads to disappointment or anger.\n\nThis led Dominique to research the new diagnosis. Karina also\nsaid she was encouraged to seek information about DID, when a\ndoctor suggested she might be suffering with it.\nWhen I was 11, I had problems at school and home. Other\nchildren made fun of me. My mom took me to a doctor and he\nsaid I had borderline, but later I was diagnosed with an anxiety\ndisorder. That doctor also suggested I had DID and told me that I\nshould read more about this diagnosis. (Karina).\n\nand Karina said that a mental health professional suggested\nthis diagnosis to them. Dominique remembers consulting a\npsychiatrist when she was 15, because she had problems\ncontrolling anger at home or in public places. She initially\nfound descriptions of borderline personality captured her\nexperiences well enough, but a psychiatrist refuted the idea and\nrecommended further diagnostics toward a dissociative disorder.\nHowever, the girl refused to go to hospital for observation.\n\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org\n\nVictoria and Mary shared similar stories about\npsychotherapists suggesting the existence of dissociative parts,\nhaving readily accepted this new category as a good explanation\n\n5\n\nMay 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 637929\n\n\fPietkiewicz et al.\n\nRevisiting False-Positive and Imitated DID\n\nfor aggressive impulses or problems with recalling situations\nevoking guilt or shame. Dominique and Victoria stressed,\nhowever, that, apart from feeling emotionally abandoned, they\ncould not trace any significant traumas in their early childhoods,\nalthough therapists maintained that such events must be present\nin dissociative patients.\n\ndifferent expectations. Whoever comes up front, then I have these\nideas. (Dominique).\n\nDominique neither had amnesia nor found evidence for\nleading separate lives and engaging herself in activities associated\nwith her characters. She maintained her job as a playwright, and\nmerely imagined alternative scenarios of her life, expressed by\nher inner heroes. In other parts of the interview, she referred\nto them as \u2018voices inside,\u2019 but admitted she never heard them\nacoustically. They were her own vivid thoughts representing\ndifferent, conflicting opinions or impulses.\nKatia said she felt internally fragmented. There were times\nwhen she engaged in certain interests, knowledge and skills, but\nshe later changed her goals. Fifteen years ago she gave up her\nacademic career and went on sickness benefit when she became\ndisabled due to medical problems; she experienced this as a great\nloss, a failure, which affected her sense of identity and purpose.\n\nI have no idea why I have this [DID]. My therapist looked for\nevidence of childhood trauma, which sounds like the easiest\nexplanation, but I don\u2019t feel I had any horrific memories which\nI threw out of my consciousness. (Victoria).\n\nKatia and Olga had used psychiatric treatment for anxiety\nand depression for years. After exploring information about\ndifferent mental disorders they concluded they had DID.\nThey thought there was a similarity between their personal\nexperiences and those of people publishing testimonials about\nmultiple personalities.\n\nIn recent years I have a growing sense of identity fragmentation. I\nhave problems with defining my identity because it changes. I used\nto feel more stable in the past. I had these versions of myself which\nwere more dominating, so I had a stronger sense of identity. For\nexample, 20 years ago there was this scientist. I was studying and\nfelt like a scientist, attending conferences. Now I don\u2019t have that\nand I don\u2019t know who I am. [. . .] I also have changing interests and\nhobbies because of different personalities. Long ago I liked certain\nmusic, played the guitar, sang songs. I don\u2019t do that anymore, I\nsuddenly lost interest in all that. (Katia).\n\nI tried to understand this battle inside, leading me to stagnation.\nI didn\u2019t know how to describe that but I recently bought a book\nHealing the fragmented selves of trauma survivors, and everything\nwas explained there. Some of these things I have discovered myself\nand some were new to me. (Olga).\n\nSubsequently, Katia presented to her doctor a review\nof literature about DID, trying to persuade him that she\nhad this disorder.\n\nTheme 2: Using the Notion of\nDissociative Parts to Justify Identity\nConfusion and Conflicting Ego-States\n\nShe described changes in her professional and social lives\nin terms of switches between dissociative parts. Although she\nmaintained the first person narrative (\u201cI was studying,\u201d \u201cI played,\u201d\nor \u201cI sang\u201d), indicating some sense of continuity, she thought it\nproved the existence of two or more distinct personalities.\nParticipants also reported thoughts, temptations, impulses or\nactions which seemed to evoke conflicting feelings. Attributing\nthem to \u2018something inside that is not-me\u2019 could free them from\nguilt or shame, so they used a metaphor of someone taking over,\nlogging in, or switching. Dominique thought it was inappropriate\nto express disappointment or anger, but she accepted the thought\nthat her dissociative parts were doing this.\n\nOnce participants had embraced the idea of having multiple\npersonalities, they seemed to construct inner reality and justify\nconflicting needs, impulses or behaviors as an expression of\ndissociative parts. They referred to being uncertain about who\nthey were and having difficulties recognizing personal emotions,\nneeds or interests. Some of them felt it was connected to a\nnegative cognition about themselves as worthless, unimportant,\nand not deserving to express what they felt or wanted. Victoria\nsaid she would rather define herself through the eyes of others:\n\nWhen I\u2019m angry at my therapist, it is not really me but somebody\ninside who gets angry easily. Greg often switches on in such\nsituations and says: \u201cTell her this and this\u201d. [. . .] I went to a shop\nonce and discovered that the price on the label was not for a whole\npackage of batteries but a single one. And suddenly Greg switched\non and had a row with the cashier. I mean, I did it, but wound up\nby his anger. This is so weird, I wouldn\u2019t react like that. They just\ncharged incorrectly and I would normally ignore that but Greg\nsaid: \u201cI give a shit about their mistakes. I won\u2019t accept that.\u201d What\na failure! (Dominique).\n\nMy therapist asked what I wanted or needed. It turned out that\nwithout other people\u2019s expectations or preferences to which I\nnormally adjust, I wouldn\u2019t know who I am or what I want. I\nusually engage in my friends\u2019 hobbies and do what I think gives\nthem pleasure. Otherwise, I think they will not like me and reject\nme, because I have nothing to offer. (Victoria).\n\nSince a young age, Dominique tended to immerse herself in\na fantasy world, developing elaborated scenarios about people\nliving in a youth center administered by a vicious boss. Different\ncharacters in her \u2018Story\u2019 represented specific features, interests\nand plans she had.\n\nMary said she had parts that expressed anger, sadness,\nand needs associated with attachment. She observed them and\nallowed them to step in, when situations required.\n\nWell, there is John who is a teacher and researcher. He teaches\nmathematics. I have no skills in maths at all. Tim is a philosopher\nand would like to train philosophers, enroll doctoral studies. He\nwould like me to study philosophy but the rest of the system\nwants me to be a worrier. Ralf is a caring nurse and would\nlike to become a paramedic. It is difficult to reconcile all these\n\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org\n\nThere were situations in my life when the teenager must have been\nactive. She protected me. She is ready to fight; I am not like that\nat all. I hate violence, and that teenager likes using force to protect\nme. [. . .] My therapist suggested I call her after this interview if I\n\n6\n\nMay 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 637929\n\n\fPietkiewicz et al.\n\nRevisiting False-Positive and Imitated DID\n\nbut not necessarily related to trauma. Katia said she recently\nremembered the picture of the house and garden where she\nplayed as a child and associated these experiences with moments\nof joy. Karina also exemplified her flashbacks with \u2018intrusions of\nhappy memories\u2019 which belonged to other personalities:\n\ndo not feel well. I didn\u2019t accept that but the [inner] girls got upset\nand told me I needed her help. They made me comply, so I agreed\nto call her if I do not feel well. It has always been like this. (Mary).\n\nDuring assessment, no participant provided evidence for the\nexistence of autonomous dissociative parts. It seems that the\ninner characters described by them personified unintegrated egostates which used to evoke conflicting feelings.\n\nSometimes I begin to laugh but this is not my laughter, but the\nlaughter of sheer joy. Someone inside me is very happy and wants\nto talk about happy childhood memories, make jokes. (Karina).\n\nTheme 3: Exploring Personal\nExperiences via the Lens of Dissociation\n\nMary said a child part of her was responsible for flashbacks and\nmaking comments about current situations. However, she later\ndenied hearing voices or having any other Schneider\u2019s symptoms.\n\nReading books, websites and watching videos of people who\nclaimed to have DID, encouraged them to compare themselves,\ntalk about and express \u2018multiple personalities.\u2019 The participants\nbecame familiar with specialist terms and learned about core\nsymptoms mentioned in psychiatric manuals.\n\nI can hear her comments, that she does not like something. I can\nbe flooded by emotions and have flashbacks associated with that\nchild. For example, there is a trigger and I can see things that\nthis child has seen. She is showing me what was happening in\nher life. (Mary).\n\nI read First person plural which helped me understand what this\nis all about. The drama of the gifted child and The body keeps the\nscore. More and more girls started to appear. There is a 6-month\nold baby which showed up only 2 months ago, a sad 11-year\nold teenager, and a 16-year old who thinks I am a loser. I was\na teenager like that. Now she is having problems and becoming\nwithdrawn there are fewer switches, because she knows we need\nto help the little one first. (Mary).\n\nParticipants discussed their dissociative parts, their names and\nfeatures, exhibiting neither avoidance nor fear or shame. On\nthe contrary, they seemed to draw pleasure by smiling, showing\nexcitement and eagerness to produce more examples of their\nunusual experiences. At the beginning of the interview, Karina\nwas very enthusiastic and said, \u201cMy heart is beating so fast, as if I\nwere in fight-or-flight mode.\u201d\n\nOlga was also inspired by books. Not only did she find\nsimilarities to trauma survivors but she made new discoveries\nand thought there were other experiences she had been unaware\nof earlier. Victoria started using techniques which literature\nrecommended for stabilization in dissociative disorders. She\nsaid these books helped her understand intense emotions and\nimprove concentration.\n\nTheme 4: Talking About DID Attracts\nAttention\nNot only were multiple personalities a helpful metaphor for\nexpressing conflicting feelings or needs (already mentioned\nin Theme 2), but they also became an important topic of\nconversations with family or friends.\n\nThis explains everything that happens to me, why I get so angry.\nI also found anchors helpful. I focus on certain objects, sounds or\nsmells which remind me where I am, instead of drifting away into\nmy thoughts. (Victoria).\n\nMy husband says sometimes: \u201cI would like to talk to the little girl.\u201d\nHe then says that I start behaving differently. I also talk to my\ntherapist using different voices. Sometimes, she addresses them\nasking questions. If questions are asked directly, they respond, but\nthere are times I do not allow them to speak, because the teenager\npart can be very mean and attacks people. (Mary).\n\nIt seemed that exploring information about DID encouraged\nchanges in participants\u2019 clinical presentation. At first, they\nmerely struggled with emotional liability or detachment, internal\nconflicts, and concentration problems. Later, they started\nreporting intrusions of dissociative parts or using clinical terms\n(e.g., flashback) for experiences which were not necessarily\nclinical symptoms. Dominique said that the characters of her\nstory would often \u2018log in\u2019 and take control. She demonstrated\nthat during the interview by changing her voice and going\ninto a \u2018trance.\u2019 She created her own metaphors, explaining\nthese experiences and comparing them with those described in\nliterature. She stressed that she never had amnesia and remained\naware of what was happening during her \u2018trance.\u2019\n\nIt may have been easier for Mary to express her needs for\ndependency and care by ascribing them to a little girl and,\nbecause she felt awkward about feeling angry with the therapist,\nattributing hostile impulses to a teenager could give her a sense\nof control and reduce guilt. Karina decided to create a videoblog for documenting dissociative parts, and shared her videos\nwith people interested in DID. She said she was surprised to find\nclips in which she looked dreadful, having her make-up smeared\nall over the face, because she had no memory of doing that.\nHowever, she showed no signs that it bothered her. She discussed\nthe videos with her best friend, a DID fan who had encouraged\nher to enroll in the study in order to confirm her diagnosis.\nThey were collecting evidence to support the idea that she had\na dissociative disorder, which she presented one by one, before\nbeing asked about details.\n\nI think it is a form of dissociation on the emotional level. I read a\nlot. . . The minds of Billy Milligan or First person plural. For sure, I\ndo not have an alteration of personality. I have co-consciousness.\nMy theory is, we are like a glove, we all stem from one trunk, but\nwe are like separate fingers. (Dominique).\n\nMark [her friend] reads a lot about DID. He says I sometimes talk\nin a high voice which is not the way I usually talk. He refers to\nus as plural. [. . .] In some of these videos I do not move or blink\n\nWhile participants maintained they had flashbacks, they\nunderstood them as sudden recollections of past memories\n\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n7\n\nMay 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 637929\n\n\fPietkiewicz et al.\n\nRevisiting False-Positive and Imitated DID\n\nfor a minute. I look at some point and there is no expression on\nmy face. I can remember things until this moment, and later I\ndiscover myself looking like something from Creepypastas. I am\nso sorry for people who have to see this. . . and I found my diary.\nI have been writing diaries since I was seven. I sometimes have no\nmemory for having written something.

It is some information but I have not heard\nanything new. (Karina).\n\nOnly Victoria seemed relieved that her DID diagnosis was not\nconfirmed. She was happy to discuss how attachment problems or\nconflicts with expressing emotions and needs affected her social\nlife and career, and receive guidelines for future treatment. She\nfelt liberated from having to uncover childhood traumas that her\ntherapist expected her to have as a dissociative patient.\n\nDominique and Katia also wrote journals to record\ndissociative experiences. Katia hoped to be recognized as\nan expert-by-experience and develop her career in relation\nto that. She brought with her a script of a book she hoped\nto publish 1 day.\n\nI was hoping that you would find another explanation for my\nproblems. . . for what is wrong with me, why I feel so sensitive\nor spaced out, because it is annoying. I would like to know what is\ngoing on. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any severe trauma but everybody\nwants to talk about trauma all the time. (Victoria).\n\nTheme 5: Ruling Out DID Leads to\nDisappointment or Anger\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nFour participants were openly disappointed that their DID\ndiagnosis was not confirmed. They doubted if their descriptions\nwere accurate enough, or they challenged the interviewer\u2019s\nunderstanding of the symptoms. Katia also suggested that she\nwas incapable of providing appropriate answers supporting her\ndiagnosis due to amnesia and personality alterations.\n\nICD-10 and DSM-5 provide inadequate criteria for diagnosing\nDID, basically limited to patients having distinct dissociative\nidentities with their own memories, preferences and behavioral\npatterns, and episodes of amnesia (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2013; World Health Organization, 1993). Clinicians\nwithout experience of DID may therefore expect patients\nto present disruptions of identity during a consultation and\nspontaneously report memory problems. However, trauma\nspecialists view DID as a \u2018disorder of hiddenness\u2019 because patients\noften find their dissociative symptoms bizarre and confusing and\ndo not disclose them readily due to their shame and the phobia\nof inner experiences (Steele et al., 2005, 2016; Van der Hart et al.,\n2006). Instead, they tend to undermine their significance, hide\nthem and not report them during consultations unless asked\nabout them directly. Dissociative patients can also be unaware\nof their amnesia and ignore evidence for having done things\nthey cannot remember because realizing that is too upsetting.\nContrary to that, this study and the one conducted in 1999 in\nthe Netherlands by Draijer and Boon, show that some people\nwith personality disorders enthusiastically report DID symptoms\nby the book, and use the notion of multiple personalities to\njustify problems with emotional regulation, inner conflicts, or\nto seek attention. As with Dutch patients, Polish participants\nwere preoccupied with their alternate personalities and two\ntried to present a \u2018switch\u2019 between parts. Their presentations\nwere na\u00efve and often mixed with lay information on DID.\nHowever, what they reported could be misleading for clinicians\ninexperienced in the dissociation field or those lacking the\nappropriate tools to distinguish a genuine dissociative disorder\nfrom an imitated one.\nTherefore, understanding the subtleties about DID clinical\npresentation, especially those which are not thoroughly described\nin psychiatric manuals, is important to come up with a correct\ndiagnosis and treatment plan. Various clinicians stress the\nimportance of understanding the quality of symptoms and\nthe mechanisms behind them in order to distinguish on the\nphenomenological level between borderline and DID patients\n(Boon and Draijer, 1993; Laddis et al., 2017). Participants in\nthis study reported problems with identity, affect regulation\n\nDo you even consider that I might give different answers if\nyou had asked these questions 2 or 5 years ago? I must have\nerased some examples from my memory and not all experiences\nbelong to me. I know that people can unconsciously modify their\nnarratives and that is why I wanted an objective assessment.\n[. . .] Nobody believed I was resistant to anesthetics until I was\ndiagnosed with some abnormalities. It was once written in my\nmedical report that I was a hypochondriac. One signature and\nthings become clear to everyone. Sometimes it is better to have\nthe worst diagnosis, but have it. (Katia).\n\nShe expected that the diagnosis would legitimize her\ninability to establish satisfactory relationships, work, and become\nfinancially independent. For this reason, she also insisted that the\nfinal report produced for her should contain information about\nhow she felt maltreated by family or doctors, and revealed her\nhopes to claim damages for health injury. Mary and Karina were\nalso upset that the interviewers did not believe they had DID.\nCan you try to imagine how hard it is? I am not making things\nup? You don\u2019t believe me. I am telling you things and you must\nbe thinking, from the adult perspective: \u201cYou are making this up.\u201d\nNothing pisses me off more than someone who is trying to prove\nto others that they have just imagined things. They [dissociative\nparts] feel neglected again, as always! (Mary).\n\nKarina tried to hide her disappointment and claimed she was\nglad she didn\u2019t have a severe mental illness. However, she thought\nshe would need to build another theory explaining her symptoms.\nAfter the interview, she sent more videos trying to prove the\nassessment results were not accurate.\nWhat about my problems then? I am unable to set boundaries,\nI have anxiety, I fear that a war might break out. If this\nis not dissociation, then what? I had tests and they ruled\nout any neurological problems. I came here and ruled out\n\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n8\n\nMay 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 637929\n\n\fPietkiewicz et al.\n\nRevisiting False-Positive and Imitated DID\n\ndissociative parts which are stuck in trauma. In addition\nto avoidance, this is another characteristic PTSD feature\nobserved in the clinical presentation of DID patients (Van\nder Hart et al., 2010). Interestingly, participants in this\nstudy showed no evidence for intrusions (images, emotions\nor somatosensory experiences directly related to trauma),\nbut rather problems with emotional regulation (illustrated in\nsections \u201cThemes 1 and 2\u201d). Asked about intrusive images,\nemotions or thoughts, some gave examples of distressing\nthoughts attacking self-image and blaming for their behavior.\nThis, however, was related to attachment problems and\ndifficulties with self-soothing. They also revealed a tendency\nto indulge themselves in these auto-critical thoughts instead of\nactively avoiding them, which is often a case in dissociative\npatients. Some intrusions reported by DID patients are\nsomatoform in nature and connected with dissociative parts\nstuck in trauma time (Pietkiewicz et al., 2018). Although\nthree participants in this study had very high scores in\nSDQ-20 indicating that they may have a dissociative disorder\n(scores of 50\u201360 are common in DID), further interviews\nrevealed that they aggravated their symptoms and, in fact,\nhad low levels of somatoform dissociation. This shows that\ntests results should be interpreted with caution and clinicians\nshould always ask patients for specific examples of the\nsymptoms they report.\n\nand internal conflicts about expressing their impulses. Some\nof them also had somatic complaints. These symptoms are\ncommon in personality disorders and also in dissociative\ndisorders, which are polysymptomatic by nature. However,\nthe quality of these symptoms and psychological mechanisms\nbehind them may be different. For a differential diagnosis,\nclinicians need to become familiar with the unique internal\ndynamics in people who have developed a structural dissociation\nof personality as a result of trauma. These patients try to\ncope with everyday life and avoid actively thinking about\nand discussing traumatic memories, or experiencing symptoms\nassociated with them. Because of that avoidance, they find\nit challenging to talk about dissociative symptoms with a\nclinician. Besides experiencing fear of being labeled as insane\nand sent to hospital, there may be internal conflicts associated\nwith disclosing information. For example, dissociative parts\nmay forbid them to talk about symptoms or past experiences.\nThis conflict can sometimes be indicated by facial expression,\ninvoluntary movements, spasms, and also felt by the clinician\nin his or her countertransference. In other words, it is not\nonly what patients say about their experiences, but how they\ndo this. Therapists\u2019 observations and countertransference may\nhelp in assessing the quality of avoidance: How openly or easily\ndo patients report symptoms or adverse life experiences? Is\nthat associated with strong depersonalisation (detachment from\nfeelings and sensations, being absent)? Is there evidence for\ninternal conflicts, shame, fear or feeling blocked when talking\nabout symptoms (often observed in facial expression, tone of\nvoice)? Participants in this study were eager to talk about how\nothers mistreated them and wanted to have that documented\non paper. Difficult experiences in the past sometimes triggered\nintense emotions in them (anger, resentment, and deep sadness)\nbut they did not avoid exploring and communicating these\nstates. On the contrary, they eagerly shared an elaborate\nnarrative of their sorrows and about their inner characters \u2013\nthe multiple personalities they were convinced they had.\nThey became keen on DID and used a variety of resources\nto familiarize themselves with core symptoms. They also\nspontaneously reported them, as if they wanted to provide\nsound evidence about having DID and were ready to defend\ntheir diagnosis. Some planned their future based on it (an\nacademic career, writing a book, or a film). During the\ninterviews, it became clear that some perceived having an\nexotic diagnosis as an opportunity for seeking attention and\nfeeling unique, exhibiting the drama of an \u2018unseen child\u2019 (see\nsection \u201cTheme 4\u201d).\nUnderstanding a few of the symptoms identified in this\nstudy can be useful for differential diagnosis: intrusions,\nvoices, switches, amnesia, use of language, depersonalisation.\nHow they are presented by patients and interpreted by\nclinicians is important.\n\nVoices\nIt is common for DID patients to experience auditory\nhallucinations (Dorahy et al., 2009; Longden et al., 2019).\nThe voices usually belong to dissociative parts and comment\non actions, express needs, likes and dislikes, and encourage\nself-mutilation. Subsequently, there may be conflicts between\n\u2018voices,\u2019 and the relationship with them is quite complex.\nDorahy et al., 2009 observe that auditory hallucinations\nare more common in DID than in schizophrenia. In\ndissociative patients they are more complex and responsive,\nand already appear in childhood. Specifically, child voices\nare also to be expected in DID (97% in comparison to 6%\nin psychosis). None of our participants reported auditory\nhallucinations although one (Dominique) said she had\nimaginary friends from childhood. While this could sound\nlike a dissociative experience, exploring their experiences\nshowed she had a tendency to absorb herself in her fantasy\nworld and vividly imagine characters in her story (see\nsection \u201cTheme 2\u201d).\n\nSwitches\nLiterature also shows that it is uncommon for avoidant\ndissociative patients to present autonomous dissociative parts\nto a therapist before a good relationship has been established\nand the phobia for inner experiences reduced (Steele et al.,\n2005). Sudden switches between dissociative personalities may\noccur only when the patient is triggered and cannot exercise\nenough control to hide his or her symptoms. Two participants\nin this study (Dominique and Karina) tried to present \u2018alternate\npersonalities\u2019 and they actually announced this would happen,\nso that the interviewer did not miss them. Later on, they could\n\nIntrusions\nTriggered by external or internal factors (memories or anything\nassociated with trauma) dissociative patients tend to relive\ntraumatic experiences. In other words, they have intrusive\nmemories, emotions or sensorimotor sensations contained by\n\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n9\n\nMay 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 637929\n\n\fPietkiewicz et al.\n\nRevisiting False-Positive and Imitated DID\n\nattacks to other parts, not-me (see: Dominique in section\n\u201cTheme 2\u201d). One might suspect it could be evidence for\nautonomous dissociative parts. However, these participants seem\nto have had unintegrated, unaccepted self-states and used the\nconcept of DID to make meaning of their internal conflicts.\nIn their narrative they maintained the first-person narrative.\nNone of them provided sound evidence for extreme forms of\ndepersonalisation, such as not feeling the body altogether or\nout-of-body experiences.\nThere can be many reasons why people develop symptoms\nwhich resemble those typical of DID. Suggestions about a\ndissociative disorder made by healthcare providers can help\npeople justify and explain inner conflicts or interpersonal\nproblems. In this study several clinicians had suggested a\ndissociative disorder or DID to the patient. Literature on\nmultiple personalities and therapy focused on them, and\nusing expressions such as \u2018parts\u2019, \u2018dissociating\u2019, \u2018switches,\u2019 can\nalso encourage demonstrating such symptoms. There are also\nsecondary gains explained in this study, such as receiving\nattention and care. Draijer and Boon (1999) observe that\npeople with borderline features justified shameful behavior\nand avoided responsibility by attributing their actions to\n\u2018alter personalities.\u2019 Such people can declare amnesia for\ntheir outbursts of anger, or hitting partners. Others explained\ntheir identity confusion and extreme emptiness using the\nDID model. All their participants reported emotional neglect\nand felt unseen in their childhood, so they adopted a\nnew DID-patient identity to fill up inner emptiness (Draijer\nand Boon, 1999). Just like the participants in this study,\nthey were angry when that diagnosis was disconfirmed\nduring the assessment, as if the clinician had taken away\nsomething precious from them. This shows that communicating\nthe results should be done with understanding, empathy\nand care. Patients and clinicians need to understand and\ndiscuss reasons for developing a DID-patient identity, its\nadvantages and pitfalls.\nIn countries where clinicians are less familiar with the\ndissociative pathology, there may be a greater risk for both falsenegative and false-positive DID diagnoses. The latter is caused\nby the growing popularity of that disorder in media and social\nnetworks. People who try to make meaning of their emotional\nconflicts, attachment problems and difficulties in establishing\nsatisfactory relationships, may find the DID concept attractive.\nIt is important that clinicians who rule out or disconfirm DID,\nalso provide patients with friendly feedback that encourages\nusing treatment for their actual problems. Nevertheless, this\nmay still evoke strong reactions in patients whose feelings\nand needs have been neglected, rejected or invalidated by\nsignificant others. Disconfirming DID may be experienced by\nthem as an attack, taking something away from them, or an\nindication that they lie.\n\nrelate to what happened during the alleged switch (no amnesia),\nmaintaining the first-person perspective (I was saying/doing).\nContrary to that, dissociative patients experience much shame\nand fear of disclosing their internal parts (Draijer and Boon,\n1999). If they become aware that switches had occurred, they try\nto make reasonable explanations for the intrusions of parts and\nunusual behavior (e.g., I must have been very tired and affected\nby the new medicine I am taking).\n\nAmnesia\nDell (2006) mentions various indicators of amnesia in patients\nwith DID. However, losing memory for unpleasant experiences\nmay occur in different disorders, usually for behaviors evoking\nshame or guilt, or for actions under extreme stress (Laddis\net al., 2017). All patients in this study had problems with\nemotional regulation and some said they could not remember\nwhat they said or did when they became very upset. With\nsome priming, they could recall and describe events. For this\nreason, it is recommended to explore evidence for amnesia for\npleasant or neutral activities (e.g., doing shopping or cleaning,\nsocializing). According to Laddis et al. (2017) there are different\nmechanisms underlying memory problems in personality and\ndissociative disorders.\n\nUse of Language\nParticipants in this study often used clinical jargon (e.g.,\nflashbacks, switches, and feeling depersonalized) which indicates\nthey had read about dissociative psychopathology or received\npsycho-education. However, they often had lay understanding\nof clinical terms. A good example in this study was having\n\u2018flashbacks\u2019 of neutral or pleasant situations which had once been\nforgotten. Examples of nightmares did not necessarily indicate\nreliving traumatic events during sleep (as in PTSD) but expressed\nconflicts and agitation through symbolic, unrealistic, sometimes\nupsetting dreams. When talking about behavior of other parts\nand their preferences, they often maintained a first-person\nperspective. Requesting patients to provide specific examples\nis thus crucial.\n\nDepersonalisation\nDetachment from feelings and emotions, bodily sensations\nand external reality is often present in various disorders\n(Simeon and Abugel, 2006). While these phenomena have\nbeen commonly associated with dissociation, Holmes et al.\n(2005) stress the differences between detachment (which can\nbe experienced by both dissociative and non-dissociative\npatients) and compartmentalisation, associated with the\nexistence of dissociative parts. Allen et al. (1999) also stress\nthat extreme absorptive detachment can interfere with noticing\nfeelings and bodily sensations, and also memory. Some\nparticipants in this study tended to enter trance-like states\nor get absorbed in their inner reality, subsequently getting\ndetached from bodily sensations. They also described their\nfeeling of emptiness in terms of detachment from feelings.\nNevertheless, none of them disclosed evidence for having\ndistinct dissociative parts. Some of their statements might\nhave been misleading; for example, when they attributed anger\n\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org\n\nLimitations and Further Directions\nAmong the 85 people who participated in a thorough diagnostic\nassessment, there were six false-positive DID cases, and this study\nfocused on their personal experiences and meaning attributed\nto the diagnosis. Because IPA studies are highly idiographic,\n\n10\n\nMay 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 637929\n\n\fPietkiewicz et al.\n\nRevisiting False-Positive and Imitated DID\n\nTABLE 4 | Red flags for identifying false-positive or imitated DID.\nThis table enumerates suggestive features of false positive or imitated DID cases identified in this study, which should be taken into consideration during diagnostic\nassessment.\n1. Directly or indirectly expects to confirm self-diagnosed DID.\n2. DID previously suggested by someone (friend, psychologist, and doctor) without thorough clinical assessment.\n3. Keen on DID diagnosis and familiarized with symptoms: read books, watched videos, talked to other patients, participated in a support group for dissociative\npatients.\n4. Uses clinical jargon: parts, alters, dissociating, switch, depersonalisation, etc.\n5. Reveals little avoidance: eagerly talks about painful experiences and dissociation, no indicators for genuine shame or inner conflicts associated with disclosing\nsymptoms or parts.\n6. Readily justifies losing control of emotions and unacceptable or shameful behavior in terms of not being oneself or being influenced by an alternative personality.\n7. No evidence for the intrusions of unwanted and avoided traumatic memories or re-experiencing them in the present.\n8. Denies having ego-dystonic thoughts or voices, especially starting in early childhood and child-like voices.\nNote: Dissociative patients may be afraid, ashamed, or feel it is forbidden to talk about the voices.\n9. No evidence of amnesia for neutral or pleasant everyday activities, e.g., working, doing shopping, socializing, playing with children.\n10. Tries to control the interview and provide evidence for having DID, e.g., eagerly reports dissociative symptoms without being asked about them.\n11. Announces and performs a switch between personalities during clinical assessment, especially before a good relationship with the clinician and trust has been\nestablished.\n12. Finds apparent gains associated with having DID: receives special interest from family and friends with whom symptoms and personalities are eagerly discussed,\nruns support groups, blogs or video channels for people with dissociative disorders.\n13. Gets upset or disappointed when DID is not confirmed, e.g., demands re-evaluation, excuses oneself for not being accurate enough in giving right answers, wants\nto provide more evidence.\n\nwhich suggested it was probable they had a dissociative\ndisorder. However, during a clinical diagnostic interview\nthey did not report a cluster of somatoform or psychoform\ndissociative symptoms and did not meet criteria for any\ndissociative disorder diagnosis. Clinicians also need to go\nbeyond the face value of a patient\u2019s responses, ask for specific\nexamples, and notice one\u2019s own countertransference. Draijer\nand Boon (1999) observed that DID patients were often\nexperienced by clinicians as very fragile, and exploring\nsymptoms with people with personality disorders (who try\nto aggravate them and control the interview) can evoke\ntiredness or even irritability. It is important that clinicians\nunderstand their own responses and use them in the\ndiagnostic process.\nWhile psycho-education is considered a crucial element in\nthe initial treatment of dissociative disorders (Van der Hart\net al., 2006; Howell, 2011; Steele et al., 2016), patients whose\ndiagnosis has not been confirmed by a thorough diagnostic\nassessment should not be encouraged to develop knowledge\nabout DID symptomatology, because this may affect their clinical\npresentation and how they make meaning of their problems.\nSubsequently, this may lead to a wrong diagnosis and treatment,\nwhich can become iatrogenic.\n\nthey are by nature limited to a small number of participants.\nThere were two important limitations in this research. Firstly,\ninformation about the level of psychoform symptoms has not\nbeen given, because the validation of the Polish instrument\nused for that purpose is not complete. Secondly, TADS-I used\nfor collecting clinical data about trauma-related symptoms and\ndissociation has not been validated, either. Because there are no\ngold standards in Poland for diagnosing dissociative disorders,\nvideo-recordings of diagnostic interviews were carefully analyzed\nand discussed by all authors to agree upon the diagnosis. Taking\nthis into consideration, further qualitative and quantitative\nresearch is recommended to formulate and validate more\nspecific diagnostic criteria for DID and guidelines for the\ndifferential diagnosis.\n\nCONCLUSION\nClinicians need to understand the complexity of DID\nsymptoms and psychological mechanisms responsible\nfor them in order to differentiate between genuine and\nimitated post-traumatic conditions. There are several features\nidentified in this study which may indicate false-positive or\nimitated DID shown in Table 4, which should be taken into\nconsideration during diagnostic assessment. In Poland, as\nin many countries, this requires more systematic training\nin diagnosis for psychiatrists and clinical psychologists in\norder to prevent under- and over-diagnosis of dissociative\ndisorders, DID in particular. It is not uncommon that\npatients exaggerate on self-report questionnaires when\nthey are invested in certain symptoms. In this study, all\nparticipants had scores above the cut-off score of 28 on\nthe SDQ-20, a measure to assess somatoform dissociation,\n\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org\n\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe datasets generated for this study are not readily available\nbecause data contain highly sensitive clinical material,\nincluding medical data which cannot be shared according\nto local regulations.

This study\nexplores meaning which patients with false-positive or imitated DID attributed to their\ndiagnosis. 85 people who reported elevated levels of dissociative symptoms in SDQ20 participated in clinical assessment using the Trauma and Dissociation Symptoms\nInterview, followed by a psychiatric interview. The recordings of six women, whose\nearlier DID diagnosis was disconfirmed, were transcribed and subjected to interpretative\nphenomenological analysis. Five main themes were identified: (1) endorsement and\nidentification with the diagnosis. (2) The notion of dissociative parts justifies identity\nconfusion and conflicting ego-states. (3) Gaining knowledge about DID affects the\nclinical presentation. (4) Fragmented personality becomes an important discussion\ntopic with others. (5) Ruling out DID leads to disappointment or anger. To avoid\nmisdiagnoses, clinicians should receive more systematic training in the assessment\nof dissociative disorders, enabling them to better understand subtle differences in the\nquality of symptoms and how dissociative and non-dissociative patients report them.\nThis would lead to a better understanding of how patients with and without a dissociative\ndisorder report core dissociative symptoms. Some guidelines for a differential diagnosis\nare provided.\nKeywords: dissociative identity disorder (DID), false-positive cases, personality disorder, dissociation, differential\ndiagnosis\n\nINTRODUCTION\nMultiple Personality Disorder (MPD) was first introduced in DSM-III in 1980 and re-named\nDissociative Identity Disorder (DID) in subsequent editions of the diagnostic manual (American\nPsychiatric Association, 2013). Table 1 shows diagnostic criteria of this disorder in ICD-10, ICD11, and DSM-5. Some healthcare providers perceive it as fairly uncommon or associated with\ntemporary trends (Brand et al., 2016). Even its description in ICD-10 (World Health Organization,\n1993) starts with: \u201cThis disorder is rare, and controversy exists about the extent to which it is\niatrogenic or culture-specific\u201d (p. 160). Yet, according to the guidelines of the International Society\nfor the Study of Trauma and Dissociation (International Society for the Study of Trauma and\nDissociation, 2011), the prevalence of DID in the general population is estimated between 1 and\n3%. The review of global studies on DID in clinical settings by Sar (2011) shows the rate from\n\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n1\n\nMay 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 637929\n\n\fPietkiewicz et al.\n\nRevisiting False-Positive and Imitated DID\n\nTABLE 1 | Diagnostic criteria for dissociative identity disorder.\nICD-10 Multiple personality disorder F44.81\n(A) Two or more distinct personalities exist within the individual, only one being evident at a time.\n(B) Each personality has its own memories, preferences, and behavior patterns, and at some time (and recurrently) takes full control of the individual\u2019s behavior.\n(C) There is inability to recall important personal information which is too extensive to be explained by ordinary forgetfulness.\n(D) The symptoms are not due to organic mental disorders (F00\u2013F09) (e.g., in epileptic disorders) or to psychoactive substance-related disorders (F10\u2013F19)\n(e.g.,\nintoxication or withdrawal).\nICD-11 Dissociative identity disorder 6B64\nDissociative identity disorder is characterized by disruption of identity in which there are two or more distinct personality states (dissociative identities) associated with\nmarked discontinuities in the sense of self and agency. Each personality state includes its own pattern of experiencing, perceiving, conceiving, and relating to self, the\nbody, and the environment. At least two distinct personality states recurrently take executive control of the individual\u2019s consciousness and functioning in interacting with\nothers or with the environment, such as in the performance of specific aspects of daily life such as parenting, or work, or in response to specific situations (e.g., those\nthat are perceived as threatening). Changes in personality state are accompanied by related alterations in sensation, perception, affect, cognition, memory, motor\ncontrol, and behavior. There are typically episodes of amnesia, which may be severe. The symptoms are not better explained by another mental, behavioral or\nneurodevelopmental disorder and are not due to the direct effects of a substance or medication on the central nervous system, including withdrawal effects, and are not\ndue to a disease of the nervous system or a sleep-wake disorder. The symptoms result in significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or\nother important areas of functioning.\nDSM-5 Dissociative identity disorder 300.14\n(A) Disruption of identity characterized by two or more distinct personality states, which may be described in some cultures as an experience of possession. The\ndisruption in identity involves marked discontinuity in sense of self and sense of agency accompanied by related alterations in affect, behavior, consciousness,\nmemory, perception, cognition, and/or sensory-motor functioning. These signs and symptoms may be observed by others or reported by the individual.\n(B) Recurrent gaps in the recall of everyday events, important personal information, and/or traumatic events that are inconsistent with ordinary forgetting.\n(C) The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.\n(D) The disturbance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious practice. Note: In children, the symptoms are not better explained by imaginary\nplaymates or other fantasy play.\n(E) The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., blackouts or chaotic behavior during alcohol intoxication) or another medical\ncondition (e.g., complex partial seizures).\n\na false positive diagnosis, which is unfavorable for the patient,\nbecause using treatment developed for DID with patients\nwithout autonomous dissociative parts may be inefficient or even\nreinforce their pathology.\nAuthors who wrote about patients inappropriately diagnosed\nwith this disorder used terms such as \u2018malingering\u2019 or \u2018factitious\u2019\nDID (Coons and Milstein, 1994; Thomas, 2001). According\nto Draijer and Boon (1999), both labels imply that patients\nintentionally simulate symptoms, either for external gains\n(financial benefits or justification for one\u2019s actions in court) or\nfor other forms of gratification (e.g., interest from others), while\nin many cases their motivation is not fully conscious. Getting\na DID diagnosis can also provide structure for inner chaos and\nincomprehensible experiences, and be associated with hope and\nbelief it is real. On the other hand, diagnostic errors often result\nin inappropriate treatment plans and procedures.\nAlready in 1995 Boon and Draijer stressed that a growing\nnumber of people self-diagnosed themselves based on\ninformation from literature and the Internet, and reported\nsymptoms by the book during psychiatric or psychological\nassessment. Based on their observation of 36 patients in whom\nDID had been ruled out after applying the structured clinical\ninterview SCID-D, these clinicians identified differences between\ngenuine and imitated DID. They classified their participants into\nthree groups: (1) borderline personality disorder, (2) histrionic\npersonality disorder, or (3) persons with severe dissociative\nsymptoms but not DID. Participants in that study reported\nsymptoms similar to DID patients, including: amnesia (but only\nfor unacceptable behavior), depersonalisation, derealisation,\nidentity confusion, and identity alteration. However, they\npresented themselves and interacted with the therapist in very\n\n0.4 to 14%. However, in studies using clinical diagnostic\ninterviews among psychiatric in-patients, and in European\nstudies these numbers were lower (Friedl et al., 2000). The\ndiscrepancies apparently depend on the sample, the methodology\nand diagnostic interviews used by researchers.\nDiagnosing complex dissociative disorders (DID or Other\nSpecified Dissociative Disorder, OSDD) is challenging for several\nreasons. Firstly, patients present a lot of avoidance and rarely\nreport dissociative symptoms spontaneously without direct\nquestioning (Boon and Draijer, 1993; International Society for\nthe Study of Trauma and Dissociation, 2011; Dorahy et al.,\n2014). In addition, standard mental state examination does not\ninclude these symptoms and healthcare professionals do not\nreceive appropriate training in diagnosing dissociative disorders\n(Leonard et al., 2005). Secondly, complex dissociative disorders\nare polysymptomatic, and specialists would rather diagnose these\npatients with disorders more familiar to them from clinical\npractice, e.g., anxiety disorders, eating disorders, schizophrenia,\nor borderline personality disorder (Boon and Draijer, 1995; Dell,\n2006; Brand et al., 2016). For these reasons, complex dissociative\ndisorders are underdiagnosed and often mis-diagnosed. For\nexample, 26.5\u201340.8% of DID patients would already have been\ndiagnosed and treated for schizophrenia (Putnam et al., 1986;\nRoss et al., 1989). On the other hand, because there is so much\ninformation about DID in the media (Hollywood productions,\ninterviews and testimonies published on YouTube, blogs), people\nwho are confused about themselves and try to find an accurate\ndiagnosis for themselves may learn about DID symptoms on the\nInternet, identify themselves with the disorder, and later (even\nunintentionally) report core symptoms in a very convincing\nway (Draijer and Boon, 1999). This presents a risk of making\n\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n2\n\nMay 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 637929\n\n\fPietkiewicz et al.\n\nRevisiting False-Positive and Imitated DID\n\ndifferent ways. While DID patients are usually reluctant to\ntalk about their symptoms and experience their intrusions as\nshameful, people who imitated DID were eager to present their\nproblems, sometimes in an exaggerated way, in an attempt to\nconvince the clinician that they suffered from DID (Boon and\nDraijer, 1995; Draijer and Boon, 1999). Similar observations\nwere expressed by Thomas (2001) saying that people with\nimitated DID can present their history chronologically, using\nthe first person even when they are highly distressed or allegedly\npresenting an altered personality, and are comfortable with\ndisclosing information about experiences of abuse. They can\ntalk about intrusions of dissociative parts, hearing voices or\ndifficulties controlling emotions, without shame.\nUnfortunately, ICD-10, ICD-11, and DSM-5 offer no specific\nguidelines on how to differentiate patients with personality\ndisorders and dissociative disorders by the manner in which\nthey report symptoms. There are also limited instruments to\ndistinguish between false-positive and false-negative DID. From\nthe clinical perspective, it is also crucial to understand the motives\nfor being diagnosed with DID, and disappointment when this\ndiagnosis is disconfirmed. Accurate assessment can contribute to\ndeveloping appropriate psychotherapeutic procedures (Boon and\nDraijer, 1995; Draijer and Boon, 1999). Apart from observations\nalready referred to earlier in this article, there are no qualitative\nanalyses of false-positive DID cases in the past 20 years.\nMost research was quantitative and compared DID patients\nand simulators in terms of cognitive functions (Boysen and\nVanBergen, 2014). This interpretative phenomenological analysis\nis an idiographic study which explores personal experiences and\nmeaning attributed to conflicting emotions and behaviors in\nsix women who had previously been diagnosed with DID and\nreferred to the Research Centre for Trauma and Dissociation for\nre-evaluation. It explores how they came to believe they have DID\nand what had led clinicians to assume that these patients could be\nsuffering from this disorder.\n\nProcedure\nThis study is part of a larger project examining alterations\nin consciousness and dissociative symptoms in clinical and\nnon-clinical groups, held at the Research Centre for Trauma\n& Dissociation, financed by the National Science Centre, and\napproved by the Ethical Review Board at the SWPS University\nof Social Sciences & Humanities. Potential candidates enrolled\nthemselves or were registered by healthcare providers via an\napplication integrated with the website www.e-psyche.eu. They\nfilled in demographic information and completed online tests,\nincluding: Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire (SDQ-20,\nPietkiewicz et al., 2018) and Trauma Experiences Checklist\n(Nijenhuis et al., 2002). Those with elevated SDQ-20 scores\n(above 28 points) or those referred for differential diagnosis were\nconsulted and if dissociative symptoms were confirmed, they\nwere invited to participate in an in-depth clinical assessment\nincluding a series of interviews, video-recorded and performed at\nthe researcher\u2019s office by the first author who is a psychotherapist\nand supervisor experienced in the dissociation field. In Poland,\nthere are no gold standards for diagnosing dissociative disorders.\nThe first interview was semi-structured, open-ended and\nexplored the patient\u2019s history, main complaints and motives for\nparticipation. It included questions such as: What made you\nparticipate in this study? What are your main difficulties or\nsymptoms in daily life? What do you think caused them? Further\nquestions were then asked to explore participants\u2019 experiences\nand meaning-making. This was followed by the Trauma and\nDissociation Symptoms Interview (TADS-I, Boon and Matthess,\n2017). The TADS-I is a new semi-structured interview intended\nto identify DSM-5 and ICD-11 dissociative disorders. The\nTADS-I differs in several ways from other semi-structured\ninterviews for the assessment of dissociative disorders. Firstly,\nit includes a significant section on somatoform dissociative\nsymptoms. Secondly, it includes a section addressing other\ntrauma-related symptoms for several reasons: (1) to obtain a\nmore comprehensive clinical picture of possible comorbidities,\nincluding symptoms of PTSD and complex PTSD, (2) to gain\na better insight into the (possible) dissociative organization of\nthe personality: patient\u2019s dissociative parts hold many of these\ncomorbid symptoms and amnesia, voices or depersonalisation\nexperiences are often associated with these symptoms; and (3)\nto better distinguish between complex dissociative disorders,\npersonality disorders and other Axis I disorders and false positive\nDID. Finally, the TADS-I also aims to distinguish between\nsymptoms of pathological dissociation indicating a division of\nthe personality and symptoms which are related to a narrowing\nor a lowering of consciousness, and not to the structural\ndissociation of the personality. Validation testing of the TADS-I\nis currently underway. TADS interviews ranging from 2 to 4 h\nwere usually held in sessions of 90 min. Interview recordings\nwere assessed by three healthcare professionals experienced in\nthe dissociation field, who discussed each case and consensually\ncame up with a diagnosis based on ICD-10. An additional mental\nstate examination was performed by the third author who is\na psychiatrist, also experienced in the differential diagnosis of\ndissociative disorders. He collected medical data, double-checked\nthe most important symptoms, communicated the results and\ndiscussed treatment indications. Qualitative data collected from\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nThis study was carried out in Poland in 2018 and\n2019. Rich qualitative material collected during in-depth\nclinical assessments was subjected to the interpretative\nphenomenological analysis (IPA), a popular methodological\nframework in psychology for exploring people\u2019s personal\nexperiences and interpretations of phenomena (Smith and\nOsborn, 2008). IPA was selected to build a deeper understanding\nof how patients who endorsed and identified with dissociative\nidentity disorder made sense of the diagnosis and what\nit meant for them to be classified as false-positive cases\nduring reassessment.\nInterpretative\nphenomenological\nanalysis\nuses\nphenomenological, hermeneutic, and idiographic principles. It\nemploys \u2018double hermeneutics,\u2019 in which participants share their\nexperiences and interpretations, followed by researchers trying\nto make sense and comment on these interpretations. IPA uses\nsmall, homogenous, purposefully selected samples, and data\nare carefully analyzed case-by-case (Smith and Osborn, 2008;\nPietkiewicz and Smith, 2014).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n3\n\nMay 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 637929\n\n\fPietkiewicz et al.\n\nRevisiting False-Positive and Imitated DID\n\nwho also developed the TADS-I. They are all mentors and\ntrainers of the European Society for Trauma and Dissociation,\nwith significant expertise in the assessment of post-traumatic\nconditions. The first co-investigator (AB) has a master\u2019s degree in\npsychology and is a Ph.D. candidate. She is also a psychotherapist\nin training. All authors coded and discussed their understanding\nof data. Their understanding and interpretations of symptoms\nreported by participants were influenced by their background\nknowledge and experience in diagnosing and treating patients\nwith personality disorders and dissociative disorders.\n\nsix patients out of 85 were selected for this interpretative\nphenomenological analysis, based on the following criteria for\ninclusion, which could ensure a homogenous sample expected of\nIPA studies \u2013 (a) female, (b) previously diagnosed or referred to\nrule in/out DID, (c) endorsement and identification with DID, (d)\ndissociative disorder disconfirmed in the assessment. Interviews\nwith every participant in this study ranged from 3 h 15 min to 7 h\n20 min (mean: 6 h).\n\nParticipants\nParticipants of this IPA were six female patients aged between\n22 and 42 years who were selected out of 86 people examined\nin a larger study exploring dissociation and alterations in\nconsciousness in clinical and non-clinical groups. (Participants\nin the larger study met criteria of different diagnoses and\nseven among them had \u2018genuine\u2019 DID). These six patients did\nnot meet DID criteria on the TADS-I interview but believed\nthemselves that they qualified for that diagnosis. Four of them\nhad higher education, two were secondary school graduates.\nAll of them registered in the study by themselves hoping to\nconfirm their diagnosis but two (Olga and Katia) were referred\nby psychiatrists, and the others by psychotherapists. All of them\ntraveled from far away, which showed their strong motivation\nto participate in the assessment. Four had previously had\npsychiatric treatment and five had been in psychotherapy due\nto problems with emotional regulation and relationships. In\nthe cases of Victoria and Dominique, psychotherapy involved\nworking with dissociative parts. None of them recalled any\nphysical or sexual abuse, but three (Dominique, Victoria, and\nMary), following therapists\u2019 suggestions, were trying to seek\nsuch traumatic memories to justify their diagnosis. They all felt\nemotionally neglected by carriers in childhood and emotionally\nabused by significant others. None of them reported symptoms\nindicating the existence of autonomous dissociative parts.\nNone had symptoms indicating amnesia for daily events, but\nfour declared not remembering single situations associated\nwith conflicting emotions, shame, guilt, or conversations\nduring which they were more focused on internal experiences\nrather than their interlocutors. None experienced PTSD\nsymptoms (e.g., intrusive traumatic memories and avoidance),\nautoscopic phenomena (e.g., out-of-body experiences), or\nclinically significant somatoform symptoms. None had\nauditory verbal hallucinations but four intensely engaged in\ndaydreaming and experienced imagined conversations as very\nreal. All of them had been seeking information about DID\nin literature and the Internet. For more information about\nthem see Table 2. Their names have been changed to protect\ntheir confidentiality.\n\nData Analysis\nVerbatim transcriptions were made of all video recordings, which\nwere analyzed together with researchers\u2019 notes using qualitative\ndata-analysis software \u2013 NVivo11. Consecutive analytical steps\nrecommended for IPA were employed in the study (Pietkiewicz\nand Smith, 2014). For each interview, researchers watched\nthe recording and carefully read the transcript several times.\nThey individually made notes about body language, facial\nexpressions, the content and language use, and wrote down\ntheir interpretative comments using the \u2018annotation\u2019 feature\nin NVivo10. Next, they categorized their notes into emergent\nthemes by allocating descriptive labels (nodes). The team then\ncompared and discussed their coding and interpretations. They\nanalyzed connections between themes in each interview and\nbetween cases, and grouped themes according to conceptual\nsimilarities into main themes and sub-themes.\n\nCredibility Checks\nDuring each interview, participants were encouraged to give\nexamples illustrating reported symptoms or experiences.\nClarification questions were asked to negotiate the meaning\nparticipants wanted to convey. At the end of the interview,\nthey were also asked questions to check that their responses\nwere thorough. The researchers discussed each case thoroughly\nand also compared their interpretative notes to compare\ntheir understanding of the content and its meaning (the\nsecond hermeneutics).\n\nRESULTS\nParticipants in this study explained how they concluded they\nwere suffering from DID, developed knowledge about the\nsyndrome and an identity of a DID patient, and how this affected\ntheir everyday life and relationships. Five salient themes appeared\nin all interviews, as listed in Table 3. Each theme is discussed\nand illustrated with verbatim excerpts from the interviews, in\naccordance with IPA principles.\n\nThe Researchers\n\nTheme 1: Endorsement and\nIdentification With the Diagnosis\n\nThe principal investigator (IJP) is a psychotherapist, supervisor,\nand researcher in the field of community health psychology\nand clinical psychology.

It was like being under control of an alien force. I started\nreading about borderline and I thought I had it. I found a webpage\nabout that and told my mother I should see a psychiatrist. I went\nfor a consultation and told her my story. This lady said: \u201cChild,\nyou don\u2019t have borderline, but multiple personality.\u201d She wanted\nto keep me in the psychiatric unit but I did not agree to stay for\nobservation.

Karina also\nsaid she was encouraged to seek information about DID, when a\ndoctor suggested she might be suffering with it.\nWhen I was 11, I had problems at school and home. Other\nchildren made fun of me. My mom took me to a doctor and he\nsaid I had borderline, but later I was diagnosed with an anxiety\ndisorder. That doctor also suggested I had DID and told me that I\nshould read more about this diagnosis. (Karina).\n\nand Karina said that a mental health professional suggested\nthis diagnosis to them. Dominique remembers consulting a\npsychiatrist when she was 15, because she had problems\ncontrolling anger at home or in public places. She initially\nfound descriptions of borderline personality captured her\nexperiences well enough, but a psychiatrist refuted the idea and\nrecommended further diagnostics toward a dissociative disorder.\nHowever, the girl refused to go to hospital for observation.\n\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org\n\nVictoria and Mary shared similar stories about\npsychotherapists suggesting the existence of dissociative parts,\nhaving readily accepted this new category as a good explanation\n\n5\n\nMay 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 637929\n\n\fPietkiewicz et al.\n\nRevisiting False-Positive and Imitated DID\n\nfor aggressive impulses or problems with recalling situations\nevoking guilt or shame. Dominique and Victoria stressed,\nhowever, that, apart from feeling emotionally abandoned, they\ncould not trace any significant traumas in their early childhoods,\nalthough therapists maintained that such events must be present\nin dissociative patients.\n\ndifferent expectations. Whoever comes up front, then I have these\nideas. (Dominique).\n\nDominique neither had amnesia nor found evidence for\nleading separate lives and engaging herself in activities associated\nwith her characters. She maintained her job as a playwright, and\nmerely imagined alternative scenarios of her life, expressed by\nher inner heroes. In other parts of the interview, she referred\nto them as \u2018voices inside,\u2019 but admitted she never heard them\nacoustically. They were her own vivid thoughts representing\ndifferent, conflicting opinions or impulses.\nKatia said she felt internally fragmented. There were times\nwhen she engaged in certain interests, knowledge and skills, but\nshe later changed her goals. Fifteen years ago she gave up her\nacademic career and went on sickness benefit when she became\ndisabled due to medical problems; she experienced this as a great\nloss, a failure, which affected her sense of identity and purpose.\n\nI have no idea why I have this [DID]. My therapist looked for\nevidence of childhood trauma, which sounds like the easiest\nexplanation, but I don\u2019t feel I had any horrific memories which\nI threw out of my consciousness. (Victoria).\n\nKatia and Olga had used psychiatric treatment for anxiety\nand depression for years. After exploring information about\ndifferent mental disorders they concluded they had DID.\nThey thought there was a similarity between their personal\nexperiences and those of people publishing testimonials about\nmultiple personalities.\n\nIn recent years I have a growing sense of identity fragmentation. I\nhave problems with defining my identity because it changes. I used\nto feel more stable in the past. I had these versions of myself which\nwere more dominating, so I had a stronger sense of identity. For\nexample, 20 years ago there was this scientist. I was studying and\nfelt like a scientist, attending conferences. Now I don\u2019t have that\nand I don\u2019t know who I am. [. . .] I also have changing interests and\nhobbies because of different personalities. Long ago I liked certain\nmusic, played the guitar, sang songs. I don\u2019t do that anymore, I\nsuddenly lost interest in all that. (Katia).\n\nI tried to understand this battle inside, leading me to stagnation.\nI didn\u2019t know how to describe that but I recently bought a book\nHealing the fragmented selves of trauma survivors, and everything\nwas explained there. Some of these things I have discovered myself\nand some were new to me. (Olga).\n\nSubsequently, Katia presented to her doctor a review\nof literature about DID, trying to persuade him that she\nhad this disorder.\n\nTheme 2: Using the Notion of\nDissociative Parts to Justify Identity\nConfusion and Conflicting Ego-States\n\nShe described changes in her professional and social lives\nin terms of switches between dissociative parts. Although she\nmaintained the first person narrative (\u201cI was studying,\u201d \u201cI played,\u201d\nor \u201cI sang\u201d), indicating some sense of continuity, she thought it\nproved the existence of two or more distinct personalities.\nParticipants also reported thoughts, temptations, impulses or\nactions which seemed to evoke conflicting feelings. Attributing\nthem to \u2018something inside that is not-me\u2019 could free them from\nguilt or shame, so they used a metaphor of someone taking over,\nlogging in, or switching. Dominique thought it was inappropriate\nto express disappointment or anger, but she accepted the thought\nthat her dissociative parts were doing this.\n\nOnce participants had embraced the idea of having multiple\npersonalities, they seemed to construct inner reality and justify\nconflicting needs, impulses or behaviors as an expression of\ndissociative parts. They referred to being uncertain about who\nthey were and having difficulties recognizing personal emotions,\nneeds or interests. Some of them felt it was connected to a\nnegative cognition about themselves as worthless, unimportant,\nand not deserving to express what they felt or wanted. Victoria\nsaid she would rather define herself through the eyes of others:\n\nWhen I\u2019m angry at my therapist, it is not really me but somebody\ninside who gets angry easily. Greg often switches on in such\nsituations and says: \u201cTell her this and this\u201d. [. . .] I went to a shop\nonce and discovered that the price on the label was not for a whole\npackage of batteries but a single one. And suddenly Greg switched\non and had a row with the cashier. I mean, I did it, but wound up\nby his anger. This is so weird, I wouldn\u2019t react like that. They just\ncharged incorrectly and I would normally ignore that but Greg\nsaid: \u201cI give a shit about their mistakes. I won\u2019t accept that.\u201d What\na failure! (Dominique).\n\nMy therapist asked what I wanted or needed. It turned out that\nwithout other people\u2019s expectations or preferences to which I\nnormally adjust, I wouldn\u2019t know who I am or what I want. I\nusually engage in my friends\u2019 hobbies and do what I think gives\nthem pleasure. Otherwise, I think they will not like me and reject\nme, because I have nothing to offer. (Victoria).\n\nSince a young age, Dominique tended to immerse herself in\na fantasy world, developing elaborated scenarios about people\nliving in a youth center administered by a vicious boss. Different\ncharacters in her \u2018Story\u2019 represented specific features, interests\nand plans she had.\n\nMary said she had parts that expressed anger, sadness,\nand needs associated with attachment. She observed them and\nallowed them to step in, when situations required.\n\nWell, there is John who is a teacher and researcher. He teaches\nmathematics. I have no skills in maths at all.

Katia said she recently\nremembered the picture of the house and garden where she\nplayed as a child and associated these experiences with moments\nof joy. Karina also exemplified her flashbacks with \u2018intrusions of\nhappy memories\u2019 which belonged to other personalities:\n\ndo not feel well. I didn\u2019t accept that but the [inner] girls got upset\nand told me I needed her help. They made me comply, so I agreed\nto call her if I do not feel well. It has always been like this. (Mary).\n\nDuring assessment, no participant provided evidence for the\nexistence of autonomous dissociative parts. It seems that the\ninner characters described by them personified unintegrated egostates which used to evoke conflicting feelings.\n\nSometimes I begin to laugh but this is not my laughter, but the\nlaughter of sheer joy. Someone inside me is very happy and wants\nto talk about happy childhood memories, make jokes. (Karina).\n\nTheme 3: Exploring Personal\nExperiences via the Lens of Dissociation\n\nMary said a child part of her was responsible for flashbacks and\nmaking comments about current situations. However, she later\ndenied hearing voices or having any other Schneider\u2019s symptoms.\n\nReading books, websites and watching videos of people who\nclaimed to have DID, encouraged them to compare themselves,\ntalk about and express \u2018multiple personalities.\u2019 The participants\nbecame familiar with specialist terms and learned about core\nsymptoms mentioned in psychiatric manuals.\n\nI can hear her comments, that she does not like something. I can\nbe flooded by emotions and have flashbacks associated with that\nchild. For example, there is a trigger and I can see things that\nthis child has seen. She is showing me what was happening in\nher life. (Mary).\n\nI read First person plural which helped me understand what this\nis all about. The drama of the gifted child and The body keeps the\nscore. More and more girls started to appear. There is a 6-month\nold baby which showed up only 2 months ago, a sad 11-year\nold teenager, and a 16-year old who thinks I am a loser. I was\na teenager like that. Now she is having problems and becoming\nwithdrawn there are fewer switches, because she knows we need\nto help the little one first. (Mary).\n\nParticipants discussed their dissociative parts, their names and\nfeatures, exhibiting neither avoidance nor fear or shame. On\nthe contrary, they seemed to draw pleasure by smiling, showing\nexcitement and eagerness to produce more examples of their\nunusual experiences. At the beginning of the interview, Karina\nwas very enthusiastic and said, \u201cMy heart is beating so fast, as if I\nwere in fight-or-flight mode.\u201d\n\nOlga was also inspired by books. Not only did she find\nsimilarities to trauma survivors but she made new discoveries\nand thought there were other experiences she had been unaware\nof earlier. Victoria started using techniques which literature\nrecommended for stabilization in dissociative disorders. She\nsaid these books helped her understand intense emotions and\nimprove concentration.\n\nTheme 4: Talking About DID Attracts\nAttention\nNot only were multiple personalities a helpful metaphor for\nexpressing conflicting feelings or needs (already mentioned\nin Theme 2), but they also became an important topic of\nconversations with family or friends.\n\nThis explains everything that happens to me, why I get so angry.\nI also found anchors helpful. I focus on certain objects, sounds or\nsmells which remind me where I am, instead of drifting away into\nmy thoughts. (Victoria).\n\nMy husband says sometimes: \u201cI would like to talk to the little girl.\u201d\nHe then says that I start behaving differently. I also talk to my\ntherapist using different voices. Sometimes, she addresses them\nasking questions. If questions are asked directly, they respond, but\nthere are times I do not allow them to speak, because the teenager\npart can be very mean and attacks people. (Mary).\n\nIt seemed that exploring information about DID encouraged\nchanges in participants\u2019 clinical presentation. At first, they\nmerely struggled with emotional liability or detachment, internal\nconflicts, and concentration problems. Later, they started\nreporting intrusions of dissociative parts or using clinical terms\n(e.g., flashback) for experiences which were not necessarily\nclinical symptoms. Dominique said that the characters of her\nstory would often \u2018log in\u2019 and take control. She demonstrated\nthat during the interview by changing her voice and going\ninto a \u2018trance.\u2019 She created her own metaphors, explaining\nthese experiences and comparing them with those described in\nliterature. She stressed that she never had amnesia and remained\naware of what was happening during her \u2018trance.\u2019\n\nIt may have been easier for Mary to express her needs for\ndependency and care by ascribing them to a little girl and,\nbecause she felt awkward about feeling angry with the therapist,\nattributing hostile impulses to a teenager could give her a sense\nof control and reduce guilt. Karina decided to create a videoblog for documenting dissociative parts, and shared her videos\nwith people interested in DID. She said she was surprised to find\nclips in which she looked dreadful, having her make-up smeared\nall over the face, because she had no memory of doing that.\nHowever, she showed no signs that it bothered her. She discussed\nthe videos with her best friend, a DID fan who had encouraged\nher to enroll in the study in order to confirm her diagnosis.\nThey were collecting evidence to support the idea that she had\na dissociative disorder, which she presented one by one, before\nbeing asked about details.\n\nI think it is a form of dissociation on the emotional level. I read a\nlot. . . The minds of Billy Milligan or First person plural. For sure, I\ndo not have an alteration of personality. I have co-consciousness.\nMy theory is, we are like a glove, we all stem from one trunk, but\nwe are like separate fingers. (Dominique).\n\nMark [her friend] reads a lot about DID. He says I sometimes talk\nin a high voice which is not the way I usually talk. He refers to\nus as plural.

It is some information but I have not heard\nanything new. (Karina).\n\nOnly Victoria seemed relieved that her DID diagnosis was not\nconfirmed. She was happy to discuss how attachment problems or\nconflicts with expressing emotions and needs affected her social\nlife and career, and receive guidelines for future treatment. She\nfelt liberated from having to uncover childhood traumas that her\ntherapist expected her to have as a dissociative patient.\n\nDominique and Katia also wrote journals to record\ndissociative experiences. Katia hoped to be recognized as\nan expert-by-experience and develop her career in relation\nto that. She brought with her a script of a book she hoped\nto publish 1 day.\n\nI was hoping that you would find another explanation for my\nproblems. . . for what is wrong with me, why I feel so sensitive\nor spaced out, because it is annoying. I would like to know what is\ngoing on. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had any severe trauma but everybody\nwants to talk about trauma all the time. (Victoria).\n\nTheme 5: Ruling Out DID Leads to\nDisappointment or Anger\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nFour participants were openly disappointed that their DID\ndiagnosis was not confirmed. They doubted if their descriptions\nwere accurate enough, or they challenged the interviewer\u2019s\nunderstanding of the symptoms. Katia also suggested that she\nwas incapable of providing appropriate answers supporting her\ndiagnosis due to amnesia and personality alterations.\n\nICD-10 and DSM-5 provide inadequate criteria for diagnosing\nDID, basically limited to patients having distinct dissociative\nidentities with their own memories, preferences and behavioral\npatterns, and episodes of amnesia (American Psychiatric\nAssociation, 2013; World Health Organization, 1993). Clinicians\nwithout experience of DID may therefore expect patients\nto present disruptions of identity during a consultation and\nspontaneously report memory problems. However, trauma\nspecialists view DID as a \u2018disorder of hiddenness\u2019 because patients\noften find their dissociative symptoms bizarre and confusing and\ndo not disclose them readily due to their shame and the phobia\nof inner experiences (Steele et al., 2005, 2016; Van der Hart et al.,\n2006). Instead, they tend to undermine their significance, hide\nthem and not report them during consultations unless asked\nabout them directly. Dissociative patients can also be unaware\nof their amnesia and ignore evidence for having done things\nthey cannot remember because realizing that is too upsetting.\nContrary to that, this study and the one conducted in 1999 in\nthe Netherlands by Draijer and Boon, show that some people\nwith personality disorders enthusiastically report DID symptoms\nby the book, and use the notion of multiple personalities to\njustify problems with emotional regulation, inner conflicts, or\nto seek attention. As with Dutch patients, Polish participants\nwere preoccupied with their alternate personalities and two\ntried to present a \u2018switch\u2019 between parts. Their presentations\nwere na\u00efve and often mixed with lay information on DID.\nHowever, what they reported could be misleading for clinicians\ninexperienced in the dissociation field or those lacking the\nappropriate tools to distinguish a genuine dissociative disorder\nfrom an imitated one.\nTherefore, understanding the subtleties about DID clinical\npresentation, especially those which are not thoroughly described\nin psychiatric manuals, is important to come up with a correct\ndiagnosis and treatment plan. Various clinicians stress the\nimportance of understanding the quality of symptoms and\nthe mechanisms behind them in order to distinguish on the\nphenomenological level between borderline and DID patients\n(Boon and Draijer, 1993; Laddis et al., 2017). Participants in\nthis study reported problems with identity, affect regulation\n\nDo you even consider that I might give different answers if\nyou had asked these questions 2 or 5 years ago? I must have\nerased some examples from my memory and not all experiences\nbelong to me. I know that people can unconsciously modify their\nnarratives and that is why I wanted an objective assessment.\n[. . .] Nobody believed I was resistant to anesthetics until I was\ndiagnosed with some abnormalities. It was once written in my\nmedical report that I was a hypochondriac. One signature and\nthings become clear to everyone. Sometimes it is better to have\nthe worst diagnosis, but have it. (Katia).\n\nShe expected that the diagnosis would legitimize her\ninability to establish satisfactory relationships, work, and become\nfinancially independent. For this reason, she also insisted that the\nfinal report produced for her should contain information about\nhow she felt maltreated by family or doctors, and revealed her\nhopes to claim damages for health injury. Mary and Karina were\nalso upset that the interviewers did not believe they had DID.\nCan you try to imagine how hard it is? I am not making things\nup? You don\u2019t believe me. I am telling you things and you must\nbe thinking, from the adult perspective: \u201cYou are making this up.\u201d\nNothing pisses me off more than someone who is trying to prove\nto others that they have just imagined things. They [dissociative\nparts] feel neglected again, as always! (Mary).\n\nKarina tried to hide her disappointment and claimed she was\nglad she didn\u2019t have a severe mental illness. However, she thought\nshe would need to build another theory explaining her symptoms.\nAfter the interview, she sent more videos trying to prove the\nassessment results were not accurate.\nWhat about my problems then? I am unable to set boundaries,\nI have anxiety, I fear that a war might break out. If this\nis not dissociation, then what? I had tests and they ruled\nout any neurological problems.

In addition\nto avoidance, this is another characteristic PTSD feature\nobserved in the clinical presentation of DID patients (Van\nder Hart et al., 2010). Interestingly, participants in this\nstudy showed no evidence for intrusions (images, emotions\nor somatosensory experiences directly related to trauma),\nbut rather problems with emotional regulation (illustrated in\nsections \u201cThemes 1 and 2\u201d). Asked about intrusive images,\nemotions or thoughts, some gave examples of distressing\nthoughts attacking self-image and blaming for their behavior.\nThis, however, was related to attachment problems and\ndifficulties with self-soothing. They also revealed a tendency\nto indulge themselves in these auto-critical thoughts instead of\nactively avoiding them, which is often a case in dissociative\npatients. Some intrusions reported by DID patients are\nsomatoform in nature and connected with dissociative parts\nstuck in trauma time (Pietkiewicz et al., 2018). Although\nthree participants in this study had very high scores in\nSDQ-20 indicating that they may have a dissociative disorder\n(scores of 50\u201360 are common in DID), further interviews\nrevealed that they aggravated their symptoms and, in fact,\nhad low levels of somatoform dissociation. This shows that\ntests results should be interpreted with caution and clinicians\nshould always ask patients for specific examples of the\nsymptoms they report.\n\nand internal conflicts about expressing their impulses. Some\nof them also had somatic complaints. These symptoms are\ncommon in personality disorders and also in dissociative\ndisorders, which are polysymptomatic by nature. However,\nthe quality of these symptoms and psychological mechanisms\nbehind them may be different. For a differential diagnosis,\nclinicians need to become familiar with the unique internal\ndynamics in people who have developed a structural dissociation\nof personality as a result of trauma. These patients try to\ncope with everyday life and avoid actively thinking about\nand discussing traumatic memories, or experiencing symptoms\nassociated with them. Because of that avoidance, they find\nit challenging to talk about dissociative symptoms with a\nclinician. Besides experiencing fear of being labeled as insane\nand sent to hospital, there may be internal conflicts associated\nwith disclosing information. For example, dissociative parts\nmay forbid them to talk about symptoms or past experiences.\nThis conflict can sometimes be indicated by facial expression,\ninvoluntary movements, spasms, and also felt by the clinician\nin his or her countertransference. In other words, it is not\nonly what patients say about their experiences, but how they\ndo this. Therapists\u2019 observations and countertransference may\nhelp in assessing the quality of avoidance: How openly or easily\ndo patients report symptoms or adverse life experiences? Is\nthat associated with strong depersonalisation (detachment from\nfeelings and sensations, being absent)? Is there evidence for\ninternal conflicts, shame, fear or feeling blocked when talking\nabout symptoms (often observed in facial expression, tone of\nvoice)? Participants in this study were eager to talk about how\nothers mistreated them and wanted to have that documented\non paper. Difficult experiences in the past sometimes triggered\nintense emotions in them (anger, resentment, and deep sadness)\nbut they did not avoid exploring and communicating these\nstates. On the contrary, they eagerly shared an elaborate\nnarrative of their sorrows and about their inner characters \u2013\nthe multiple personalities they were convinced they had.\nThey became keen on DID and used a variety of resources\nto familiarize themselves with core symptoms. They also\nspontaneously reported them, as if they wanted to provide\nsound evidence about having DID and were ready to defend\ntheir diagnosis. Some planned their future based on it (an\nacademic career, writing a book, or a film). During the\ninterviews, it became clear that some perceived having an\nexotic diagnosis as an opportunity for seeking attention and\nfeeling unique, exhibiting the drama of an \u2018unseen child\u2019 (see\nsection \u201cTheme 4\u201d).\nUnderstanding a few of the symptoms identified in this\nstudy can be useful for differential diagnosis: intrusions,\nvoices, switches, amnesia, use of language, depersonalisation.\nHow they are presented by patients and interpreted by\nclinicians is important.\n\nVoices\nIt is common for DID patients to experience auditory\nhallucinations (Dorahy et al., 2009; Longden et al., 2019).\nThe voices usually belong to dissociative parts and comment\non actions, express needs, likes and dislikes, and encourage\nself-mutilation. Subsequently, there may be conflicts between\n\u2018voices,\u2019 and the relationship with them is quite complex.\nDorahy et al., 2009 observe that auditory hallucinations\nare more common in DID than in schizophrenia. In\ndissociative patients they are more complex and responsive,\nand already appear in childhood. Specifically, child voices\nare also to be expected in DID (97% in comparison to 6%\nin psychosis). None of our participants reported auditory\nhallucinations although one (Dominique) said she had\nimaginary friends from childhood. While this could sound\nlike a dissociative experience, exploring their experiences\nshowed she had a tendency to absorb herself in her fantasy\nworld and vividly imagine characters in her story (see\nsection \u201cTheme 2\u201d).\n\nSwitches\nLiterature also shows that it is uncommon for avoidant\ndissociative patients to present autonomous dissociative parts\nto a therapist before a good relationship has been established\nand the phobia for inner experiences reduced (Steele et al.,\n2005). Sudden switches between dissociative personalities may\noccur only when the patient is triggered and cannot exercise\nenough control to hide his or her symptoms. Two participants\nin this study (Dominique and Karina) tried to present \u2018alternate\npersonalities\u2019 and they actually announced this would happen,\nso that the interviewer did not miss them. Later on, they could\n\nIntrusions\nTriggered by external or internal factors (memories or anything\nassociated with trauma) dissociative patients tend to relive\ntraumatic experiences. In other words, they have intrusive\nmemories, emotions or sensorimotor sensations contained by\n\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org\n\n9\n\nMay 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 637929\n\n\fPietkiewicz et al.\n\nRevisiting False-Positive and Imitated DID\n\nattacks to other parts, not-me (see: Dominique in section\n\u201cTheme 2\u201d). One might suspect it could be evidence for\nautonomous dissociative parts. However, these participants seem\nto have had unintegrated, unaccepted self-states and used the\nconcept of DID to make meaning of their internal conflicts.\nIn their narrative they maintained the first-person narrative.\nNone of them provided sound evidence for extreme forms of\ndepersonalisation, such as not feeling the body altogether or\nout-of-body experiences.\nThere can be many reasons why people develop symptoms\nwhich resemble those typical of DID. Suggestions about a\ndissociative disorder made by healthcare providers can help\npeople justify and explain inner conflicts or interpersonal\nproblems. In this study several clinicians had suggested a\ndissociative disorder or DID to the patient. Literature on\nmultiple personalities and therapy focused on them, and\nusing expressions such as \u2018parts\u2019, \u2018dissociating\u2019, \u2018switches,\u2019 can\nalso encourage demonstrating such symptoms. There are also\nsecondary gains explained in this study, such as receiving\nattention and care. Draijer and Boon (1999) observe that\npeople with borderline features justified shameful behavior\nand avoided responsibility by attributing their actions to\n\u2018alter personalities.\u2019 Such people can declare amnesia for\ntheir outbursts of anger, or hitting partners. Others explained\ntheir identity confusion and extreme emptiness using the\nDID model. All their participants reported emotional neglect\nand felt unseen in their childhood, so they adopted a\nnew DID-patient identity to fill up inner emptiness (Draijer\nand Boon, 1999). Just like the participants in this study,\nthey were angry when that diagnosis was disconfirmed\nduring the assessment, as if the clinician had taken away\nsomething precious from them. This shows that communicating\nthe results should be done with understanding, empathy\nand care. Patients and clinicians need to understand and\ndiscuss reasons for developing a DID-patient identity, its\nadvantages and pitfalls.\nIn countries where clinicians are less familiar with the\ndissociative pathology, there may be a greater risk for both falsenegative and false-positive DID diagnoses. The latter is caused\nby the growing popularity of that disorder in media and social\nnetworks. People who try to make meaning of their emotional\nconflicts, attachment problems and difficulties in establishing\nsatisfactory relationships, may find the DID concept attractive.\nIt is important that clinicians who rule out or disconfirm DID,\nalso provide patients with friendly feedback that encourages\nusing treatment for their actual problems. Nevertheless, this\nmay still evoke strong reactions in patients whose feelings\nand needs have been neglected, rejected or invalidated by\nsignificant others. Disconfirming DID may be experienced by\nthem as an attack, taking something away from them, or an\nindication that they lie.\n\nrelate to what happened during the alleged switch (no amnesia),\nmaintaining the first-person perspective (I was saying/doing).\nContrary to that, dissociative patients experience much shame\nand fear of disclosing their internal parts (Draijer and Boon,\n1999). If they become aware that switches had occurred, they try\nto make reasonable explanations for the intrusions of parts and\nunusual behavior (e.g., I must have been very tired and affected\nby the new medicine I am taking).\n\nAmnesia\nDell (2006) mentions various indicators of amnesia in patients\nwith DID. However, losing memory for unpleasant experiences\nmay occur in different disorders, usually for behaviors evoking\nshame or guilt, or for actions under extreme stress (Laddis\net al., 2017). All patients in this study had problems with\nemotional regulation and some said they could not remember\nwhat they said or did when they became very upset. With\nsome priming, they could recall and describe events. For this\nreason, it is recommended to explore evidence for amnesia for\npleasant or neutral activities (e.g., doing shopping or cleaning,\nsocializing). According to Laddis et al. (2017) there are different\nmechanisms underlying memory problems in personality and\ndissociative disorders.\n\nUse of Language\nParticipants in this study often used clinical jargon (e.g.,\nflashbacks, switches, and feeling depersonalized) which indicates\nthey had read about dissociative psychopathology or received\npsycho-education. However, they often had lay understanding\nof clinical terms. A good example in this study was having\n\u2018flashbacks\u2019 of neutral or pleasant situations which had once been\nforgotten. Examples of nightmares did not necessarily indicate\nreliving traumatic events during sleep (as in PTSD) but expressed\nconflicts and agitation through symbolic, unrealistic, sometimes\nupsetting dreams. When talking about behavior of other parts\nand their preferences, they often maintained a first-person\nperspective. Requesting patients to provide specific examples\nis thus crucial.\n\nDepersonalisation\nDetachment from feelings and emotions, bodily sensations\nand external reality is often present in various disorders\n(Simeon and Abugel, 2006). While these phenomena have\nbeen commonly associated with dissociation, Holmes et al.\n(2005) stress the differences between detachment (which can\nbe experienced by both dissociative and non-dissociative\npatients) and compartmentalisation, associated with the\nexistence of dissociative parts. Allen et al. (1999) also stress\nthat extreme absorptive detachment can interfere with noticing\nfeelings and bodily sensations, and also memory. Some\nparticipants in this study tended to enter trance-like states\nor get absorbed in their inner reality, subsequently getting\ndetached from bodily sensations. They also described their\nfeeling of emptiness in terms of detachment from feelings.\nNevertheless, none of them disclosed evidence for having\ndistinct dissociative parts. Some of their statements might\nhave been misleading; for example, when they attributed anger\n\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org\n\nLimitations and Further Directions\nAmong the 85 people who participated in a thorough diagnostic\nassessment, there were six false-positive DID cases, and this study\nfocused on their personal experiences and meaning attributed\nto the diagnosis.

Directly or indirectly expects to confirm self-diagnosed DID.\n2. DID previously suggested by someone (friend, psychologist, and doctor) without thorough clinical assessment.\n3. Keen on DID diagnosis and familiarized with symptoms: read books, watched videos, talked to other patients, participated in a support group for dissociative\npatients.\n4. Uses clinical jargon: parts, alters, dissociating, switch, depersonalisation, etc.\n5. Reveals little avoidance: eagerly talks about painful experiences and dissociation, no indicators for genuine shame or inner conflicts associated with disclosing\nsymptoms or parts.\n6. Readily justifies losing control of emotions and unacceptable or shameful behavior in terms of not being oneself or being influenced by an alternative personality.\n7. No evidence for the intrusions of unwanted and avoided traumatic memories or re-experiencing them in the present.\n8. Denies having ego-dystonic thoughts or voices, especially starting in early childhood and child-like voices.\nNote: Dissociative patients may be afraid, ashamed, or feel it is forbidden to talk about the voices.\n9. No evidence of amnesia for neutral or pleasant everyday activities, e.g., working, doing shopping, socializing, playing with children.\n10. Tries to control the interview and provide evidence for having DID, e.g., eagerly reports dissociative symptoms without being asked about them.\n11. Announces and performs a switch between personalities during clinical assessment, especially before a good relationship with the clinician and trust has been\nestablished.\n12. Finds apparent gains associated with having DID: receives special interest from family and friends with whom symptoms and personalities are eagerly discussed,\nruns support groups, blogs or video channels for people with dissociative disorders.\n13. Gets upset or disappointed when DID is not confirmed, e.g., demands re-evaluation, excuses oneself for not being accurate enough in giving right answers, wants\nto provide more evidence.\n\nwhich suggested it was probable they had a dissociative\ndisorder. However, during a clinical diagnostic interview\nthey did not report a cluster of somatoform or psychoform\ndissociative symptoms and did not meet criteria for any\ndissociative disorder diagnosis. Clinicians also need to go\nbeyond the face value of a patient\u2019s responses, ask for specific\nexamples, and notice one\u2019s own countertransference. Draijer\nand Boon (1999) observed that DID patients were often\nexperienced by clinicians as very fragile, and exploring\nsymptoms with people with personality disorders (who try\nto aggravate them and control the interview) can evoke\ntiredness or even irritability. It is important that clinicians\nunderstand their own responses and use them in the\ndiagnostic process.\nWhile psycho-education is considered a crucial element in\nthe initial treatment of dissociative disorders (Van der Hart\net al., 2006; Howell, 2011; Steele et al., 2016), patients whose\ndiagnosis has not been confirmed by a thorough diagnostic\nassessment should not be encouraged to develop knowledge\nabout DID symptomatology, because this may affect their clinical\npresentation and how they make meaning of their problems.\nSubsequently, this may lead to a wrong diagnosis and treatment,\nwhich can become iatrogenic.\n\nthey are by nature limited to a small number of participants.\nThere were two important limitations in this research. Firstly,\ninformation about the level of psychoform symptoms has not\nbeen given, because the validation of the Polish instrument\nused for that purpose is not complete. Secondly, TADS-I used\nfor collecting clinical data about trauma-related symptoms and\ndissociation has not been validated, either. Because there are no\ngold standards in Poland for diagnosing dissociative disorders,\nvideo-recordings of diagnostic interviews were carefully analyzed\nand discussed by all authors to agree upon the diagnosis. Taking\nthis into consideration, further qualitative and quantitative\nresearch is recommended to formulate and validate more\nspecific diagnostic criteria for DID and guidelines for the\ndifferential diagnosis.\n\nCONCLUSION\nClinicians need to understand the complexity of DID\nsymptoms and psychological mechanisms responsible\nfor them in order to differentiate between genuine and\nimitated post-traumatic conditions. There are several features\nidentified in this study which may indicate false-positive or\nimitated DID shown in Table 4, which should be taken into\nconsideration during diagnostic assessment. In Poland, as\nin many countries, this requires more systematic training\nin diagnosis for psychiatrists and clinical psychologists in\norder to prevent under- and over-diagnosis of dissociative\ndisorders, DID in particular. It is not uncommon that\npatients exaggerate on self-report questionnaires when\nthey are invested in certain symptoms. In this study, all\nparticipants had scores above the cut-off score of 28 on\nthe SDQ-20, a measure to assess somatoform dissociation,\n\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org\n\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe datasets generated for this study are not readily available\nbecause data contain highly sensitive clinical material,\nincluding medical data which cannot be shared according\nto local regulations.

Should we be worried? How is the Triple E virus spreading in the U.S. and what measures can be taken to combat?", "context_document": "A 41-year-old man in New Hampshire died last week after contracting a rare mosquito-borne illness called eastern equine encephalitis virus, also known as EEE or \u201ctriple E.\u201d It was New Hampshire\u2019s first human case of the disease in a decade. Four other human EEE infections have been reported this year in Wisconsin, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Vermont. \n \n\n Though this outbreak is small and triple E does not pose a risk to most people living in the United States, public health officials and researchers alike are concerned about the threat the deadly virus poses to the public, both this year and in future summers. There is no known cure for the disease, which can cause severe flu-like symptoms and seizures in humans 4 to 10 days after exposure and kills between 30 and 40 percent of the people it infects. Half of the people who survive a triple E infection are left with permanent neurological damage. Because of EEE\u2019s high mortality rate, state officials have begun spraying insecticide in Massachusetts, where 10 communities have been designated \u201ccritical\u201d or \u201chigh risk\u201d for triple E. Towns in the state shuttered their parks from dusk to dawn and warned people to stay inside after 6 p.m., when mosquitoes are most active. \n \n\n Like West Nile virus, another mosquito-borne illness that poses a risk to people in the U.S. every summer, triple E is constrained by environmental factors that are changing rapidly as the planet warms. That\u2019s because mosquitoes thrive in the hotter, wetter conditions that climate change is producing.\n \n\n \u201cWe have seen a resurgence of activity with eastern equine encephalitis virus over the course of the past 10 or so years,\u201d said Theodore G. Andreadis, a researcher who studied mosquito-borne diseases at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, a state government research and public outreach outfit, for 35 years. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen an advancement into more northern regions where it had previously not been detected.\u201d Researchers don\u2019t know what causes the virus to surge and abate, but Andreadis said it\u2019s clear that climate change is one of the factors spurring its spread, particularly into new regions. \n \n\n The first triple E outbreak on record occurred in Massachusetts in the 1830s in horses \u2014 the reason one of the three Es stands for \u201cequine.\u201d It wasn\u2019t until a full century later, in 1934, that mosquitoes were incriminated as potential vectors for the disease. The first recorded human cases of the disease also occurred in Massachusetts four years later, in 1938. There were 38 human cases in the state that year; 25 of them were fatal. Since then, human cases have mostly been registered in Gulf Coast states and, increasingly, the Northeast. From 1964 to 2002, in the Northeast, there was less than one case of the disease per year. From 2003 to 2019, the average in the region increased to between four and five cases per year.\n \n\n The disease is spread by two types of mosquito. The first is a species called Culiseta melanura, or the black-tailed mosquito. This mosquito tends to live in hardwood bogs and feeds on birds like robins, herons, and wrens, spreading the virus among them. But the melanura mosquito doesn\u2019t often bite mammals. A different mosquito species, Coquillettidia perturbans, is primarily responsible for most of the human cases of the disease reported in the U.S. The perturbans mosquito picks up the EEE virus when it feeds on birds and then infects the humans and horses that it bites. Toward the end of the summer, when mosquitoes have reached their peak numbers and start jostling for any available blood meal, human cases start cropping up. \n \n\n Andreadis, who published a historical retrospective on the progression of triple E in the northeastern U.S. in 2021, said climate change has emerged as a major driver of the disease. \n \n\n \u201cWe\u2019ve got milder winters, we\u2019ve got warmer summers, and we\u2019ve got extremes in both precipitation and drought,\u201d he said. \u201cThe impact that this has on mosquito populations is probably quite profound.\u201d \n \n\n Warmer global average temperatures generally produce more mosquitoes, no matter the species. \n \n\n Studies have shown that warmer air temperatures up to a certain threshold, around 90 degrees Fahrenheit, shorten the amount of time it takes for C. melanura eggs to hatch. Higher temperatures in the spring and fall extend the number of days mosquitoes have to breed and feed. And they\u2019ll feed more times in a summer season if it\u2019s warmer \u2014 mosquitoes are ectothermic, meaning their metabolism speeds up in higher temperatures. \n \n\n Rainfall, too, plays a role in mosquito breeding and activity, since mosquito eggs need water to hatch. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, which means that even small rainfall events dump more water today than they would have last century. The more standing water there is in roadside ditches, abandoned car tires, ponds, bogs, and potholes, the more opportunities mosquitoes have to breed. And warmer water decreases the incubation period for C. melanura eggs, leading one study to conclude that warmer-than-average water temperatures \u201cincrease the probability for amplification of EEE.\u201d \n \n\n Climate change isn\u2019t the only factor encouraging the spread of disease vectors like mosquitoes. The slow reforestation of areas that were clear-cut for industry and agriculture many decades ago is creating new habitat for insects. At the same time, developers are building new homes in wooded or half-wooded zones in ever larger numbers, putting humans in closer proximity to the natural world and the bugs that live in it. \n \n\n On an individual level, the best way to stay safe from EEE and other mosquito-borne diseases is to prevent bites: Wear long sleeves and pants at dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes are most prone to biting, and regularly apply an effective mosquito spray. But there are also steps that local health departments can take to safeguard public health, like testing pools of water for mosquito larvae and conducting public awareness and insecticide spraying campaigns when triple E is detected. Massachusetts is an example of a state that has been proactive about testing mosquitoes for triple E in recent summers. \n \n\n The most effective way to protect people from this disease would be to develop a vaccine against it. A vaccine already exists for horses, but there is little incentive for vaccine manufacturers to develop a preventative for triple E in humans because the illness is so rare.  \n \n\n \u201cAlthough EEE is not yet a global health emergency, the recent uptick in cases has highlighted our lack of preparedness for unexpected infectious disease outbreaks,\u201d a group of biologists wrote last year in the open-access scientific journal Frontiers. \u201cIt would be wise to follow proactive active control measures and increase vigilance in the face of these threats.\u201d", "full_prompt": "<TASK DESCRIPTION>\n Only use the provided text to answer the question, no outside sources.\n \n\n <QUESTION>\n What is the effects of the Triple E virus on humans?

The response should be no more than 500 words and exactly 3 paragraphs.", "user_request": "Paraphrase the text.", "context_document": "Status Offenses\nStatus offenses comprise one category that may pose a particular issue with respect to the act \nrequirement. As one legal scholar has explained, status offenses are crimes such as vagrancy, \nwhich are \u201coften defined in such a way as to punish status (e.g., being a vagrant) rather than to \npunish specific action or omission to act.\u201d205 On a number of occasions, examples of which \nfollow, the Supreme Court has invalidated laws establishing status offenses. \nIn its 1957 opinion in Lambert v. California,\n206 the Court reversed a conviction under an \nordinance that made it \u201cunlawful for \u2018any convicted person\u2019 to be or remain in Los Angeles for a \nperiod of more than five days without registering\u201d and required \u201cany person having a place of \nabode outside the city to register if he comes into the city on five occasions or more during a 30-\nday period.\u201d207 The Court explained that the law criminalized \u201cconduct that is wholly passive\u2014\nmere failure to register,\u201d which it viewed as \u201cunlike the commission of acts, or the failure to act \nunder circumstances that should alert the doer to the consequences of his deed.\u201d208 As a result, the\nCourt held that the ordinance violated the defendant\u2019s due process right to notice.209 Following \nLambert, however, a number of mandatory registration laws have survived constitutional \nchallenges.210 For instance, in examining an indictment for a violation of the federal Sex Offender \nRegistration and Notification Act (SORNA), the Ninth Circuit agreed with the government that \n\u201cLambert is inapplicable because convicted sex offenders are generally subject to registration \nrequirements in all fifty states, and [the defendant] was aware that he was obligated to register as \na sex offender.\u201d\n211\nIn a 1962 opinion in Robinson v. California,\n212 the Court reversed a conviction under a state law \nthat criminalized addiction to narcotics without requiring any additional act by the defendant. \nAccording to the Court, the statute was distinguishable from \u201cone which punishes a person for the \nuse of narcotics, for their purchase, sale or possession, or for antisocial or disorderly behavior \nresulting from their administration,\u201d since it instead made \u201cthe \u2018status\u2019 of narcotic addiction a \ncriminal offense, for which the offender may be prosecuted \u2018at any time before he reforms.\u2019\u201d\n213\nThe Court held that the law, \u201cwhich imprisons a person . . . afflicted [by narcotics addiction] as a \ncriminal, even though he has never touched any narcotic drug within the State or been guilty of \nany irregular behavior there, inflicts a cruel and unusual punishment\u201d in violation of the Eighth \nAmendment, as incorporated against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.214\nStatus offenses can often be \u201creformulated and redrafted to conform to basic principles of \ncriminal justice.\u201d215 For instance, if a \u201cstatute that penalizes being an alcoholic or drug addict is \nimpermissible,\u201d a \u201cstatute that penalizes appearing in public in an intoxicated state\u201d may be\npermissible.\n216 The Supreme Court\u2019s 1968 opinion in Powell v. Texas217 illustrates this distinction. \nPowell stemmed from the conviction of a defendant under a state law making it a crime to \u201cget \ndrunk or be found in a state of intoxication in any public place, or at any private house except [a \nperson\u2019s] own.\u201d218 The defendant argued that he had a compulsion to drink and that the law \namounted to cruel and unusual punishment pursuant to Robinson.\n219 A four-Justice plurality of the \nCourt disagreed and explained that the defendant was convicted \u201cnot for being a chronic \nalcoholic, but for being in public while drunk on a particular occasion.\u201d220 In other words, the \nplurality concluded that the law did not seek \u201cto punish a mere status\u201d as the law at issue in \nRobinson did, but instead punished a voluntary act, being in public while intoxicated.221 In a \nconcurring opinion, Justice White said that the result would have been different if the public \nintoxication were an unavoidable result of chronic alcoholism.222 For example, according to \nJustice White, the Eighth Amendment would prohibit criminalizing public intoxication for \nchronic alcoholics who are homeless because \u201cthey have no place else to go and no place else to \nbe when they are drinking.\u201d\n223 Four dissenting Justices would have agreed with that conclusion.224\nThe primary point of departure between Justice White and the dissenting Justices was over the \nrecord in Powell\u2014Justice White agreed with the ultimate result in Powell because \u201cnothing in the \nrecord indicates that [the defendant] could not have done his drinking in private or that he was so \ninebriated at the time that he had lost control of his movements and wandered into the public \nstreet.\u201d225 The dissenting Justices concluded, however, that the \u201cappellant is a \u2018chronic alcoholic\u2019 \nwho, according to the trier of fact, cannot resist the \u2018constant excessive consumption of alcohol\u2019 \nand does not appear in public by his own volition but under a compulsion\u2019 which is part of his \ncondition.\u201d\n226Another example of the distinction between an impermissible status offense and a\nseemingly permissible conduct-based offense may be found in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, which in relevant \npart provides that \u201cany alien who (1) has been arrested and deported or excluded and deported, \nand thereafter (2) enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in, the United States . . .\n[without the consent of the Attorney General] shall be fined . . . or imprisoned . . . or both.\u201d227\nSome federal appellate courts have rejected the argument that \u201cthe \u2018found in\u2019 provision of \u00a7 1326 \nimpermissibly punishes aliens for their \u2018status\u2019 of being found in the United States.\u201d228 In United \nStates v. Ayala, the Ninth Circuit distinguished \u00a7 1326 from the law at issue in Robinson, \nexplaining that \u201c[a] conviction under \u00a7 1326 for being \u2018found in\u2019 the United States necessarily \nrequires that a defendant commit an act: he must re-enter the United States without permission \nwithin five years after being deported.\u201d229\nFederal appellate courts had split on the issue of whether the Robinson and Powell distinction \nbetween impermissible status offenses and permissible conduct-based offenses allowed \n\u201ccriminalizing conduct that is an unavoidable consequence of one\u2019s status.\u201d230 In the 2024 \nopinion City of Grants Pass v. Johnson, the Supreme Court examined this issue in the context of a \nmunicipal ordinance criminalizing sleeping or camping in public.231 In a divided opinion, the \nNinth Circuit concluded that the ordinance constituted cruel and unusual punishment, citing to \nPowell\u2019s concurrence and dissent for the proposition that \u201ca person cannot be prosecuted for \ninvoluntary conduct if it is an unavoidable consequence of one\u2019s status.\u201d\n232 The Ninth Circuit \nobserved that this would be the inevitable outcome for some of the involuntary homeless \npopulation in Grants Pass, which exceeded the available shelter space in the jurisdiction.233\nThe Supreme Court disagreed, concluding that the camping ordinance was not a status offense of \nthe type barred in Robinson (which lacked a mental state or act requirement), because the \nordinance in Grants Pass required \u201cactions like \u2018occupy[ing] a campsite\u2019 on public property \u2018for \nthe purpose of maintaining a temporary place to live.\u2019\u201d\n234 The Court likened the facts of Grants \nPass to those of Powell and relied on the Powell plurality\u2019s distinction between laws \ncriminalizing status and those criminalizing acts, even if on some level those acts may be an \ninvoluntary result of the underlying status.235 Although the Court did not reconsider Robinson, it \nreiterated that the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment focuses on \nthe method or kind of punishment a government may impose, rather than on the question of what \na government may criminalize.\n236 Additional analysis of Grants Pass and its broader implications \nfor status offenses and homelessness laws may be found in other CRS products.23", "full_prompt": "This task requires you to answer questions based solely on the information provided in the prompt.

The Committee notes that the precursor to this \nprovision, Section 1005 of the American Rescue Plan Act, which \nprovided loan forgiveness for socially disadvantaged farmers and \nranchers, was struck down in court on equal protection grounds. \nThe Committee reminds the Department that U.S. courts have held \nthat significant participation by the Federal government in nongovernmental entities\u2019 unconstitutional actions may be a violation \nof the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Committee, \ntherefore, encourages USDA to support programs that include the \nuse of wood products to improve the nation\u2019s ability to withstand \nand recover from weather-related and other natural events. \nRural Healthcare.\u2014The Committee is encouraged by the opportunities to address nutrition security and rural healthcare across the \nDepartment and urges the Department to integrate strategic outcomes from recent summits across Rural Development, Food and \nNutrition Services, Agricultural Marketing Service to provide technical assistance and guidance with respect to these outcomes to the \nDepartment\u2019s outreach, extension, and county offices, particularly \nin communities that lack application experience or healthcare facilities. \nSimplified USDA Applications.\u2014USDA customers are overburdened with complex program applications, contracts, and reporting. \nThe Committee requests a report from USDA describing the barriers to simplifying program applications, contracts, and reporting. \nThe report should also include any plans USDA has to simplify \nthese documents and procedures. \nSpending Plans.\u2014The bill continues a provision in Title VII that \nrequires USDA to submit spending plans to the Committee within \n30 days of enactment. Previous versions of these plans have not included adequate details that would be useful for Committee overVerDate Sep 11 2014 22:55 Jun 28, 2023 Jkt 052642 PO 00000 Frm 00007 Fmt 6659 Sfmt 6602 E:\\HR\\OC\\HR124.XXX HR124\ndmwilson on DSKJM0X7X2PROD with REPORTS\n8 \nsight. The Committee requests that USDA spending plans include \nfor each program, project, or activity: (1) a comparison between the \nbudget justification funding levels, the most recent Congressional \ndirectives or approved funding levels, and the funding levels proposed by the department or agency; and (2) a clear, concise, and \ninformative description/justification. The Committee reminds \nUSDA of notification requirements, also included in Title VII, for \nall applicable changes. \nStatus of House and Senate Report Language.\u2014The Department \nis directed to include in its fiscal year 2025 Congressional Justification, as a single exhibit, a table listing all deliverables, with a column for due dates if applicable. OBPA is directed to provide updates on the status of House and Senate reports upon request from \nthe Committees. \nUnderserved Producers Program.\u2014The Committee is concerned \nabout the Department\u2019s reckless implementation of Section 22007 \nof the Inflation Reduction Act through nongovernmental entities \nwho undergo no formal application process to aid farmers, ranchers, and foresters who have experienced discrimination in FSA \nlending programs. The Committee notes that the precursor to this \nprovision, Section 1005 of the American Rescue Plan Act, which \nprovided loan forgiveness for socially disadvantaged farmers and \nranchers, was struck down in court on equal protection grounds. \nThe Committee reminds the Department that U.S. courts have held \nthat significant participation by the Federal government in nongovernmental entities\u2019 unconstitutional actions may be a violation \nof the Fourteenth Amendment. As the Department provides nongovernmental entities with entirely Federal funds, the Committee \nwill closely monitor the Department\u2019s use and involvement in the \nadministration of the Section 22007 funds. \nUSDA Domestic and International Commodity Procurement Review.\u2014The COVID\u201319 pandemic and resulting supply chain disruptions revealed fragilities in America\u2019s food supply, to the detriment of farmers, producers, and consumers across America. The \nCommittee directs AMS and ERS to review USDA\u2019s application and \nenrollment procedures, required commodity quality, best and most \navailable commodities for purchase regionally, and outreach practices to small and local farmers for all available domestic and international USDA procurement programs. This will help increase understanding of programs and purchasing to elevate fair participation of America\u2019s small and local farmers. Within 180 days of enactment of this Act, AMS and ERS shall report back on their findings and efforts on improving small and local farmer procurement \nfor relevant USDA programs. \nUSDA Farm Delivery Systems Modernization.\u2014The Committee \nincludes language that requires the Secretary to submit a plan to \naccelerate the implementation and use of the Farmers.gov application and the Enterprise Data Analytics Platform and Toolset \n(EDAPT). The Committee is aware that despite continued direction \nand funding provided by Congress, the Farm Service Agency, the \nFarm Production and Conservation Business Center, and the Office \nof the Chief Information Officer continue to maintain numerous \nlegacy mission support systems that should be decommissioned and \ntransitioned to applications that are interoperable, facts-based, \ndata driven, and provide excellent customer service.\n\nsystem instructions: Do not use any prior knowledge.

But at one point, I accumulated over $250,000 mainly due to a $122,000 private real estate investment windfall.\n\nIn addition to accumulating cash, I also dollar-cost averaged in the S&P 500 on the way down in 2022 and way up in 2023. I also dollar-cost averaged in Sunbelt real estate, which struggled in 2023 due to high mortgage rates. These purchases were usually in $1,000 \u2013 $5,000 increments.\n\nAfter building a larger-than-normal cash balance, here's how I'd deploy it in today's market. I'm constantly updating this post as conditions change, so book mark it if interested. If you have less than $250,000, that\u2019s fine too. I share the percentages of where I will allocate my money.\n\nBackground Info To Understand Our Investment Process\nI'm 46 and my wife is 42. Our kids our 6 and 4.\n\nWe consider ourselves moderately conservative investors since we haven't had regular day job income since 2012 for me and 2015 for my wife.\n\nWe fear having to go back to work full-time, not because of work itself but because we fear losing our freedom to spend time with our young children. As a result, we are unwilling to take too much investment risk until both attend school full-time in fall 2024.\n\nAlthough we don't have day jobs, we do generate passive investment income to cover most of our living expenses. This is our definition of financial independence.\n\nWe also generate online income, which we usually reinvest to generate more passive income. Therefore, our cash pile will continue to build if we don't spend or invest all the money.\n\nOur children's educational expenses are on track after we superfunded two 529 plans when they were born. We also have life insurance and estate planning set up. The only foreseeable big ticket item coming up is a car in 2029.\n\nHere's how we'd invest $250,000 cash in today's market. This is what we did and are doing with our own cash. This is not investment advice for you as everybody's financial goals, risk tolerance, and situation are different.\n\nPlease always do your own due diligence before making any investment. Your investment decisions are yours alone.\n\n1) Treasury Bonds (50% Of Cash Holding)\nOnly about 3% of our net worth is in bonds, mostly individual muni bonds we plan to hold until maturity. Our target annual net worth growth rate is between 5% to 10% a year, depending on economic conditions. As a result, being able to earn 5% on a Treasury bond is enticing.\n\nThe 10-year yield is currently at ~4.2% and Fed Chair Jerome Powell has hinted at Fed rate cuts starting in mid-2024. Investors can get up to around 5% for a one-year Treasury bond.\n\nAlthough locking in a 4% \u2013 5% return won't make us rich, it will provide us peace of mind. We also already feel rich, so making more money won't make us feel richer. Our focus is on optimizing our freedom and time.\n\nBelow is a recent bond yield table for all the various types of bonds you can buy, by duration. Risk-free Treasury bills and CDs look attractive. If you're in the highest marginal income tax bracket, municipal bonds look good too. Notice how the Treasury bond yield curve is still inverted.\n\nNow that we've deployed 50% of our cash in Treasury bonds, the remaining 49.9% of our cash will be invested in risk assets.\n\n2) Stocks (15% Of Cash Holdings)\nRoughly 15% of our net worth is in stocks after paying cash for a new house in 4Q2023. The range has fluctuated between 20% \u2013 35% since I left work in 2012. Since I started working in equities in 1999, I've done my best to diversify away from stocks and into hard assets.\n\nMy career and pay were already leveraged to the stock market. And I saw so many great fortunes made and lost during my time in the industry. When I left work, I continued my preference of investing mostly in real estate.\n\nWe almost always front-loaded our stock purchases for the year through our kids' Roth IRAs, custodial accounts, SEP IRAs, and 529 plans. For over 23 years, we've always front-loaded our tax-advantaged accounts at the beginning of the year to get them out of the way.\n\nMost of the time it works out, some of the time it doesn't, like in 2022. That's market timing for you. But we got to front-load our tax-advantaged investments again in 2023, which has worked out great. Keep on investing consistently!\n\nIn addition to maxing out all our tax-advantaged accounts, we've been regular contributors to our taxable online brokerage accounts. After all, in order to retire early, you need a much larger taxable investment portfolio to live off its income.\n\nWhen it comes to stocks, it's important to invest for specific purposes. If you do, you will be much more motivated to save and invest since stocks provide no utility or joy.\n\nStocks Seem Fully Valued Now\nHere are the 2024 Wall Street S&P 500 forecasts with an average year-end price target of about 4,850. In other words, there\u2019s now downside at these levels for 2024 if the average prediction comes true. Although, some strategists are forecasting 5,100-5,500 for the year.\n\nGiven the situation, I'm just buying in $1,000 \u2013 $5,000 tranches after every 1% decline. The huge year-end rally in stocks has pulled forward the expected performance in 2024.\n\nHere is a post that provides a framework for your stock allocation by bond yield. The higher risk-free bond yields go, the lower your stock allocation is recommended to be and vice versa.\n\nIf I was in my 20s and 30s, I would allocate 50% of my cash to buying stocks instead. The remaining 20% would go to online real estate as the sector rebounds, 20% to venture capital, and only 10% would go to Treasuries and education. Remember, every investment is based off an individual's personal financial situation and goals.\n\n3) Venture Capital (15% Of Cash Holding)\nI enjoy investing in private funds because they are long-term investments with no day-to-day price updates. As a result, these investments cause little stress and are easy to forget about. Private investing forces you to invest for the long run.\n\nI've already made capital commitments to a couple venture capital funds from Kleiner Perkins, Burst Capital, and Structural Capital (venture debt). As a result, I will just keep contributing to these funds whenever there are capital calls.\n\nVenture capital is likely going to roar back in 2024 given private company valuations took a hit since 2022. Capital often rotates toward the biggest underperforming asset classes.\n\nInvesting In Artificial Intelligence\nI'm most excited about investing in artificial intelligence, one of the biggest investment opportunities over the next decade. My Kleiner Perkins funds are actively making AI investments. But these funds are invite only with $100,000+ minimums.\n\nThe Fundrise Innovation Fund, on the other hand, is open to all with a $10 minimum investment. The fund invests in AI companies such as Databricks and Canva. Both are incredible companies and I look forward to the fund getting into more promising AI deals.\n\n20 years from now, I don't want my kids asking me why I didn't invest in AI or work in AI given I had a chance to near the beginning. By investing in funds that invest in AI, at least I'll be able to benefit if I can't get a job in AI.\n\nHere's an hour-long discussion I have with Ben Miller, CEO of Fundrise, about AI and investing in growth companies. Roughly 35% of the Innovation Fund is invested in AI companies.\n\n4) Real Estate (20% Of Cash Holding)\nI\u2019m bullish on real estate in 2024 as the sector plays catch-up to stocks. With mortgage rates coming down, demand is going to rebound. As a result, I\u2019m actively buying real estate funds today.\n\nReal estate is my favorite asset class to build wealth. It provides shelter, generates income, and is less volatile. Unlike with some stocks, real estate values just don't decline by massive amounts overnight due to some small earnings miss. Real estate accounts for about 50% of our net worth.\n\nNo matter what happens to the value of our current forever home we bought in 2020, I'm thankful it has been able to keep my family safe and loved during the pandemic. When it comes to buying a primary residence, it's lifestyle first, investment returns a distant second.", "full_prompt": "[query]\n=======\nAccording to the article, what percentage of your savings is best to put into venture capital?\n\n----------\n\n[instruction]\n=======\nIn your answer, refer only to the context document.

To what extent is Patient X's diet aligned with the DGAC policy recommendations referenced in the included document?\n", "context_document": "Which Key Issues Were Raised by Stakeholders with the 2015\nDGAC\u2019s Report?\nThe DGAC\u2019s report addressed many issues of concern to public health, nutrition, and agricultural\nstakeholders. HHS and USDA received over 29,000 written comments during the 75-day\ncomment period, as well as 73 oral comments at a March 2015 public meeting.25 Stakeholders\nflagged several issues with the 2015 DGAC\u2019s report, particularly with the scope of the DGAC\u2019s\nrecommendations, the process by which the DGAC made its conclusions and recommendations,\nand concerns over several specific recommendations.26\nScope\nOne concern noted by stakeholders with the DGAC\u2019s report was its scope, with some maintaining\nthat the committee exceeded the scope of its charter by making certain policy recommendations.\nFor example, although the 2015 DGAC\u2019s report noted that no food groups need to be entirely\neliminated to improve food sustainability outcomes, the DGAC concluded that individuals should\neat less red and processed meat in favor of a plant-based diet, as \u201ca diet higher in plant-based\nfoods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in calories and\nanimal-based foods is more health promoting and is associated with less environmental impact\nthan is the current U.S. diet.\u201d The DGAC added that due to high consumption of animal-based\nfoods (e.g., meat, eggs, and dairy products) and low intake of plant-based foods, the average U.S.\ndiet may have a large impact on the environment in terms of increased Greenhouse Gas (GHG)\nemissions, land use, water use, and energy use.\nIn addition, the DGAC made several policy recommendations that raised concern among some\nstakeholders, including FDA revision of the Nutrition Facts label to include a mandatory\ndeclaration for added sugars, in both grams and teaspoons per serving, as well as a % daily value\n(DV);27 alignment of federal nutrition assistance programs (e.g., SNAP and WIC) with the DGA;\nand use of economic and tax policies to encourage the production and consumption of healthy\nfoods and to reduce consumption of unhealthy foods (e.g., by taxing sugar-sweetened beverages,\nsnack foods, and desserts, and by restricting marketing of certain foods to children and teens).28\nSome Members of Congress have said that the DGAC \u201chad neither the expertise, evidence, nor\ncharter\u201d to make recommendations about matters of sustainability and tax policy,29 and this\n\n24 Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, February 19, 2015, see http://www.health.gov/\ndietaryguidelines/.\n25 Testimony of Secretary of USDA Tom Vilsack, October 7, 2015, Committee on Agriculture Hearing, U.S. House of\nRepresentatives.\n26 Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of all the concerns surrounding the DGAC report.\n27 Per FDA\u2019s proposed supplemental rule, this %DV would be based on the recommendation that the daily intake of\ncalories from added sugars not exceed 10% of total calories. For a 2,000 calorie diet, 10% would equate to\napproximately 50 grams of added sugar per day (10% of 2,000 equals 200 calories from added sugar; there are 4\ncalories per gram of sugar, so 200 calories divided by 4 equals 50 grams of added sugar per day).\n28 Scientific Report of the 2015 DGAC, Part D: Chapter 6: Cross-Cutting Topics of Public Health Importance; see\nhttp://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-report/pdfs/scientific-report-of-the-2015-dietary-guidelinesadvisory-committee.pdf.\n29 Letter from various Members of Congress to Secretaries Vilsack and Burwell, March 31, 2015; see\n\nconcern has been reiterated by some meat industry groups.30 Meanwhile, others have supported\nthe discussion surrounding sustainability, saying that it is important to have an understanding of\nhow food production affects the environment.31\nIn response to these concerns, the HHS and USDA Secretaries determined that issues of\nsustainability and tax policy would not be part of the final policy document and that the DGA\nwould \u201cremain within the scope of our mandate in the 1990 National Nutrition Monitoring and\nRelated Research Act (P.L. 101-445, NNMRRA), which is to provide \u2018nutritional and dietary\ninformation and guidelines\u2019 ... \u2018based on the preponderance of the scientific and medical\nknowledge.\u2019\u201d\n32\nProcess\nAnother stakeholder concern with the 2015 DGAC\u2019s report was the process used to evaluate the\nevidence.

To what extent is Patient X's diet aligned with the DGAC policy recommendations referenced in the included document?\n\nContext:\nWhich Key Issues Were Raised by Stakeholders with the 2015\nDGAC\u2019s Report?\nThe DGAC\u2019s report addressed many issues of concern to public health, nutrition, and agricultural\nstakeholders. HHS and USDA received over 29,000 written comments during the 75-day\ncomment period, as well as 73 oral comments at a March 2015 public meeting.25 Stakeholders\nflagged several issues with the 2015 DGAC\u2019s report, particularly with the scope of the DGAC\u2019s\nrecommendations, the process by which the DGAC made its conclusions and recommendations,\nand concerns over several specific recommendations.26\nScope\nOne concern noted by stakeholders with the DGAC\u2019s report was its scope, with some maintaining\nthat the committee exceeded the scope of its charter by making certain policy recommendations.\nFor example, although the 2015 DGAC\u2019s report noted that no food groups need to be entirely\neliminated to improve food sustainability outcomes, the DGAC concluded that individuals should\neat less red and processed meat in favor of a plant-based diet, as \u201ca diet higher in plant-based\nfoods, such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and lower in calories and\nanimal-based foods is more health promoting and is associated with less environmental impact\nthan is the current U.S. diet.\u201d The DGAC added that due to high consumption of animal-based\nfoods (e.g., meat, eggs, and dairy products) and low intake of plant-based foods, the average U.S.\ndiet may have a large impact on the environment in terms of increased Greenhouse Gas (GHG)\nemissions, land use, water use, and energy use.\nIn addition, the DGAC made several policy recommendations that raised concern among some\nstakeholders, including FDA revision of the Nutrition Facts label to include a mandatory\ndeclaration for added sugars, in both grams and teaspoons per serving, as well as a % daily value\n(DV);27 alignment of federal nutrition assistance programs (e.g., SNAP and WIC) with the DGA;\nand use of economic and tax policies to encourage the production and consumption of healthy\nfoods and to reduce consumption of unhealthy foods (e.g., by taxing sugar-sweetened beverages,\nsnack foods, and desserts, and by restricting marketing of certain foods to children and teens).28\nSome Members of Congress have said that the DGAC \u201chad neither the expertise, evidence, nor\ncharter\u201d to make recommendations about matters of sustainability and tax policy,29 and this\n\n24 Scientific Report of the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee, February 19, 2015, see http://www.health.gov/\ndietaryguidelines/.\n25 Testimony of Secretary of USDA Tom Vilsack, October 7, 2015, Committee on Agriculture Hearing, U.S. House of\nRepresentatives.\n26 Please note that this is not an exhaustive list of all the concerns surrounding the DGAC report.\n27 Per FDA\u2019s proposed supplemental rule, this %DV would be based on the recommendation that the daily intake of\ncalories from added sugars not exceed 10% of total calories. For a 2,000 calorie diet, 10% would equate to\napproximately 50 grams of added sugar per day (10% of 2,000 equals 200 calories from added sugar; there are 4\ncalories per gram of sugar, so 200 calories divided by 4 equals 50 grams of added sugar per day).\n28 Scientific Report of the 2015 DGAC, Part D: Chapter 6: Cross-Cutting Topics of Public Health Importance; see\nhttp://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-report/pdfs/scientific-report-of-the-2015-dietary-guidelinesadvisory-committee.pdf.\n29 Letter from various Members of Congress to Secretaries Vilsack and Burwell, March 31, 2015; see\n\nconcern has been reiterated by some meat industry groups.30 Meanwhile, others have supported\nthe discussion surrounding sustainability, saying that it is important to have an understanding of\nhow food production affects the environment.31\nIn response to these concerns, the HHS and USDA Secretaries determined that issues of\nsustainability and tax policy would not be part of the final policy document and that the DGA\nwould \u201cremain within the scope of our mandate in the 1990 National Nutrition Monitoring and\nRelated Research Act (P.L. 101-445, NNMRRA), which is to provide \u2018nutritional and dietary\ninformation and guidelines\u2019 ... \u2018based on the preponderance of the scientific and medical\nknowledge.\u2019\u201d\n32\nProcess\nAnother stakeholder concern with the 2015 DGAC\u2019s report was the process used to evaluate the\nevidence.

Do not use outside information.", "user_request": "Please give a summary of how Covid19 has affected behavior health.", "context_document": "Behavioral Health During the COVID-19 Pandemic \nData from multiple sources suggest that mental health symptoms and substance use have increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. These symptoms include emotional distress and anxiety, depression, and trauma-related conditions. Substance use refers to the number of individuals using substances such as alcohol or illicit drugs, and the frequency and quantities of use. \nTypically, comprehensive national morbidity and mortality data on mental health conditions, substance use, associated hospitalizations, and substance-related overdose deaths take months to compile and report. Comprehensive national data for 2020 are not yet available. Several organizations, including multiple federal agencies, have used short surveys and rapid data reporting to monitor mental health symptoms and substance use during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nAlthough the methodological differences between these surveys and perennial surveys make comparisons between years imperfect, most of the 2020 data suggest an increase in behavioral health morbidity in the United States over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic.  \nMental Health  \nData collected from multiple surveys during the COVID-19 pandemic suggest that Americans experienced increased stress and symptoms of mental health conditions. In a survey conducted in April 2020, the State Health Access Data Assistance Center (SHADAC)\u2014a program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation\u2014found that over 90% of U.S. adults reported experiencing additional levels of stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this context, stress refers to psychological stress, which occurs when individuals believe that the consequences of a situation outweigh their ability to adequately cope with it. Reactions to stressors may include fear and concern about the future, tension and irritability, sadness or depression, or feeling powerless or overwhelmed, among others.\nWithout adequate coping strategies, stress can have detrimental effects on mental health. Coping strategies include any behavioral, social, or cognitive techniques used to mitigate the effects of stress. Coping strategies can be adaptive, meaning they promote better overall functioning (e.g., social connections, physical activities, hobbies, good sleep hygiene), or they can be maladaptive, meaning they are more likely to result in worse overall functioning (e.g., substance use, excessive screen time, risky behaviors). Although maladaptive coping strategies may reduce stress in the moment, they may exacerbate problems in the long term.  \nMany individuals experiencing stress may have adequate coping strategies, meaning that stress is present but does not impair their daily functioning. For others, stress\u2014and in particular stress caused by the pandemic\u2014may have detrimental effects on their mental health. A nationally representative survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) throughout the pandemic found that an increasing number of Americans reported that pandemic-related stress was affecting their mental health. In March 2020, 32% of respondents felt that worry or stress related to coronavirus had a negative impact on their mental health. In April 2020 that number rose to 45%, and in July 2020, 53% reported that pandemic-related stress was affecting their mental health.  \nMental Health Disorders \nIn some cases, extreme or prolonged stress can lead to mental health disorders. According to data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), the percentage of Americans experiencing symptoms of a mental health disorder appears to have increased during the COVID19 pandemic. NCHS\u2014a research agency under the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u2014partnered with the U.S. Census Bureau on the Household Pulse Survey to monitor the social and economic effects of the pandemic on American households. The nationally representative survey collected data on employment status, food security, housing, physical and mental health, access to health care (including mental health care), and education disruption during the coronavirus pandemic. NCHS survey questions were designed to obtain information on the frequency of anxiety and depression symptoms. \nOther indicators of psychological distress appear elevated during the first phases of the pandemic. For example, CDC analysis of national emergency department (ED) visits showed that socioeconomic and psychosocial-related visits increased during April 2020 (compared with April 2019), while total ED visits decreased over 40%. Socioeconomic or psychosocial factors were one of a few categories of ED visits that increased; most of the 200 common diagnostic causes of ED visits decreased during that same time. Other research suggests that ED visits for mental health conditions may have decreased during the first few months of the pandemic, to a lesser extent than overall ED visits. \nSuicide \nSome evidence suggests that suicidal thoughts may have increased during the pandemic. One CDC analysis found that during the pandemic approximately twice as many U.S. adults reported serious consideration of suicide in the previous 30 days compared with 2018 (10.7% versus4.3%). Although the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline did not report increases in call volume, the Disaster Distress Helpline (part of the Suicide Lifeline) experienced a 335% increase in calls during the first five months of the pandemic.  \nThe effects of the pandemic on suicide attempts and suicide deaths is unclear, though it appears that suicide mortality has decreased compared with previous years. An increase in suicidal thoughts does not necessarily equate to an increase in suicide attempts or suicide deaths.\nResearch from CDC shows a decrease in emergency department (ED) visits for suicide attempts between March and October 2020 compared with the same period in 2019, but to a lesser extent than overall ED visits. Preliminary national suicide mortality data in the United States for 2020 show that suicide deaths in the United States may have decreased in 2020 compared with the three previous years. In addition, regional differences may account for changes in suicide mortality. For example, some individual states and municipalities have reported stable rates in suicide deaths during the pandemic, whereas others have reported decreased rates. There may be demographic differences in suicide rates during the pandemic also. For example, CDC reported that in May 2020 ED visits for suspected suicide attempts began to increase among adolescents, especially girls. Researchers in Maryland found that suicide mortality rates increased for Black residents from March 2020 to May 2020, while decreasing for White residents over that same time.\nSubstance Use-Related Overdoses \nComprehensive national data on drug-related overdoses and overdose deaths during the pandemic are not yet available. Preliminary data from the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) suggest increases in drug-related overdoses during the first few months of the pandemic. The Overdose Detection Mapping Application Program (ODMAP), an ONDCP surveillance system \nthat tracks suspected overdose data nationally in near real-time, reported an increase of 11% in fatal overdoses and a 19% increase in nonfatal overdoses from March through May 2020 compared with the same months in 2019. Nearly 62% of participating counties reported increases from March to May 2020. Other areas have reported stable rates of overdose deaths. \nNotably, ODMAP overdose submissions appeared to be trending upward prior to the onset of the pandemic, making it difficult to determine the effects of the pandemic and mitigation measures using these data.\nCDC also noted an increase in drug-related overdose deaths in the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar to the ODMAP data, the CDC data showed that overdose deaths were already increasing in the months preceding the pandemic. However, CDC data showed the rate of overdose deaths accelerating after the pandemic began. In an analysis of provisional CDC mortality data, the National Institute for Health Care Management found that the rise is particularly notable for deaths involving synthetic opioids. In addition, the institute reported increases in deaths involving commonly prescribed opioids and heroin\u2014both of which had been declining in recent years.\n When examining emergency department (ED) visits, CDC found a higher number of drug overdoses\u2014including opioid overdoses\u2014between March and October 2020 compared with the same period in 2019. Put together, the ODMAP and CDC data suggest that drug-related overdoses and overdose deaths have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Individuals with substance use disorders may be at higher risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 due to unstable housing situations, high incarceration rates, or the inability to physically distance themselves. In addition, those with substance use disorders may be at higher risk for complications of COVID-19 because substance use can often suppress the immune system or inhibit respiratory functioning.", "full_prompt": "System instructions: Only use the text provided to answer.

All you need to do is use your computer or mobile device to connect to your cloud service provider through the internet. Once connected, you get access to computing resources, which may include serverless computing, virtual machines, storage, and various other things.\n \n\n Basically, cloud service providers have massive data centers that contain hundreds of servers, storage systems and components that are crucial for many kinds of organizations. These data centers are in secure locations and store a large amount of data. The users connect to these data centers to collect data or use it when required. Users can take advantage of various services; for example, if you want a notification every time someone sends you a text or an email, cloud services can help you. The best part about cloud platforms is that you pay only for the services you use, and there are no charges upfront.\n \n\n Cloud computing can be used for various purposes: machine learning, data analysis, storage and backup, streaming media content and so much more.

All you need to do is use your computer or mobile device to connect to your cloud service provider through the internet. Once connected, you get access to computing resources, which may include serverless computing, virtual machines, storage, and various other things.\n \n\n Basically, cloud service providers have massive data centers that contain hundreds of servers, storage systems and components that are crucial for many kinds of organizations. These data centers are in secure locations and store a large amount of data. The users connect to these data centers to collect data or use it when required. Users can take advantage of various services; for example, if you want a notification every time someone sends you a text or an email, cloud services can help you. The best part about cloud platforms is that you pay only for the services you use, and there are no charges upfront.\n \n\n Cloud computing can be used for various purposes: machine learning, data analysis, storage and backup, streaming media content and so much more.

While most genetic changes aren\u2019t harmful on their own, an accumulation of genetic changes over many years can turn healthy cells into cancerous cells. The vast majority of cancers occur by chance as a result of this process over time.\n \n\n Cancer itself can\u2019t be passed down from parents to children. And genetic changes in tumor cells can\u2019t be passed down. But a genetic change that increases the risk of cancer can be passed down (inherited) if it is present in a parent's egg or sperm cells.\n \n\n For example, if a parent passes a mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene to their child, the child will have a much higher risk of developing breast and several other cancers. \n \n\n That\u2019s why cancer sometimes appears to run in families. Up to 10% of all cancers may be caused by inherited genetic changes.  \n \n\n Inheriting a cancer-related genetic change doesn\u2019t mean you will definitely get cancer. It means that your risk of getting cancer is increased. \n \n\n A family cancer syndrome, also called a hereditary cancer syndrome, is a rare disorder in which family members have a higher-than-average risk of developing a certain type or types of cancer. Family cancer syndromes are caused by inherited genetic variants in certain cancer-related genes.\n \n\n With some family cancer syndromes, people tend to develop cancer at an early age or have other noncancer health conditions. \n \n\n For example, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a family cancer syndrome caused by certain inherited changes in the APC gene. People with FAP have a very high chance of developing colorectal cancer at an early age and are also at risk of developing other kinds of cancer.\n \n\n But not all cancers that appear to \u201crun in families\u201d are caused by family cancer syndromes. A shared environment or habits, such as exposure to air pollution or tobacco use, may cause the same kind of cancer to develop among family members.\n \n\n Also, multiple family members may develop common cancers, such as prostate cancer, just by chance. Cancer can also run in a family if family members have a combination of many genetic variants that each have a very small cancer risk.\n \n\n Certain genetic tests can show if you\u2019ve inherited a genetic change that increases your risk of cancer. This testing is usually done with a small sample of blood, but it can sometimes be done with saliva, cells from inside the cheek, or skin cells.\n \n\n Not everyone needs to get genetic testing for cancer risk. Your doctor or health care provider can help you decide if you should get tested for genetic changes that increase cancer risk. They will likely ask if you have certain patterns in your personal or family medical history, such as cancer at an unusually young age or several relatives with the same kind of cancer. \n \n\n If your doctor recommends genetic testing, talking with a genetic counselor can help you consider the potential risks, benefits, and drawbacks of genetic testing in your situation. After testing, a genetic counselor, doctor, or other health care professional trained in genetics can help you understand what the test results mean for you and for your family members.\n \n\n Although it\u2019s possible to order an at-home genetic test on your own, these tests have many drawbacks and are not generally recommended as a way to see whether you have inherited a genetic change that increases cancer risk.\n \n\n If you have cancer, a different type of genetic test called a biomarker test can identify genetic changes that may be driving the growth of your cancer. This information can help your doctors decide which therapy might work best for you or if you may be able to enroll in a particular clinical trial. For more information, see Biomarker Testing for Cancer Treatment. Biomarker testing may also be called tumor profiling or molecular profiling.\n \n\n Biomarker testing is different from the genetic testing that is used to find out if you have an inherited genetic change that makes you more likely to get cancer. Biomarker testing is done using a sample of your cancer cells\u2014either a small piece of a tumor or a sample of your blood.\n \n\n In some cases, the results of a biomarker test might suggest that you have an inherited mutation that increases cancer risk. If that happens, you may need to get another genetic test to confirm whether you truly have an inherited mutation that increases cancer risk.\n \n\n Genetic changes can lead to cancer if they alter the way your cells grow and spread. Most cancer-causing DNA changes occur in genes, which are sections of DNA that carry the instructions to make proteins or specialized RNA such as microRNA.  \n \n\n For example, some DNA changes raise the levels of proteins that tell cells to keep growing. Other DNA changes lower the levels of proteins that tell cells when to stop growing. And some DNA changes stop proteins that tell cells to self-destruct when they are damaged.\n \n\n For a healthy cell to turn cancerous, scientists think that more than one DNA change has to occur. People who have inherited a cancer-related genetic change need fewer additional changes to develop cancer. However, they may never develop these changes or get cancer.\n \n\n As cancer cells divide, they acquire more DNA changes over time. Two cancer cells in the same tumor can have different DNA changes. In addition, every person with cancer has a unique combination of DNA changes in their cancer. \n \n\n Multiple kinds of genetic changes can lead to cancer. One genetic change, called a DNA mutation or genetic variant, is a change in the DNA code, like a typo in the sequence of DNA letters. \n \n\n Some variants affect just one DNA letter, called a nucleotide. A nucleotide may be missing, or it may be replaced by another nucleotide. These are called point mutations.\n \n\n For example, around 5% of people with cancer have a point mutation in the KRAS gene that replaces the DNA letter G with AExit Disclaimer. This single letter change creates an abnormal KRAS protein that constantly tells cells to grow.  \n \n\n Cancer-causing genetic changes can also occur when segments of DNA\u2014sometimes very large ones\u2014are rearranged, deleted, or copied. These are called chromosomal rearrangements.\n \n\n For example, most chronic myelogenous leukemias (a type of blood cancer) are caused by a chromosomal rearrangement that places part of the BCR gene next to the ABL gene. This rearrangement creates an abnormal protein, called BCR-ABL, that makes leukemia cells grow out of control.  \n \n\n Some cancer-causing DNA changes occur outside genes, in sections of DNA that act like \u201con\u201d or \u201coff\u201d switches for nearby genes. For example, some brain cancer cells have multiple copies of \u201con\u201d switches next to genes that drive cell growth.\n \n\n Other DNA changes, known as epigenetic changes, can also cause cancer. Unlike genetic variants, epigenetic changes (sometimes called epimutations) may be reversible and they don\u2019t affect the DNA code. Instead, epigenetic changes affect how DNA is packed into the nucleus. By changing how DNA is packaged, epigenetic changes can alter how much protein a gene makes.\n \n\n Some substances and chemicals in the environment that cause genetic changes can also cause epigenetic changes, such as tobacco smoke, heavy metals like cadmium, and viruses like Epstein-Barr virus.", "full_prompt": "[question]\n I read this article about genetic cancer.

Perhaps it began with the Code of Hammurabi (1792\u20131750 BCE), which imposed sanctions for errors in medical and surgical practices. The same type of punishment also existed in Persia. Later on, the Visigoths promulgated laws that punished poisoning, infanticide, and homicide. Described as a medical trunk that serves the administration of justice, forensic medicine has different branches. Forensic pathology is probably the most emblematic one. Known in many Latin countries as tanathology (from the Greek word thanatos, meaning \u201cdeath\u2019s god\u201d), definitions of forensic pathology are often so broad that they would fit better into forensic medicine as a whole than in this single branch. For Di Maio (3), it is \u201ca branch of medicine that applies the principles and knowledge of the medical sciences in the field of law.\u201d An even larger conception of forensic pathology (4) considers it the study of diseases and injuries of the community, because it involves the knowledge of diagnosis and treatment in every medical specialty, but also requires information in many nonmedical areas, such as chemistry, physics, criminalistics and police sciences, motor vehicle and highway conception, politics, sociology, and even the way of life of a society. Closer to its objectives and limits, Williams et al. (5) define forensic pathology as a specialized branch of pathology (pathology being the study by scientific methods of disease and tissue injury) that relates within a legal framework to the effects of trauma, poisoning, occupational hazards, and natural disease. Introduction to Forensic Medicine 15 Forensic dissections of bodies began in the 13th century at the University of Bologna in Italy by a surgeon and teacher of anatomy, Saliceto (6). Surprisingly, these forensic dissections appeared before the hospital autopsies that started by the end of the 19th century with Rokitansky, Virchow, and the advent of the pathogenesis of diseases and cellular pathology (6). However, some authors (7) consider the French surgeon Ambrosio Par\u00e9, who in 1575 began a real scientific period in France, the father of legal medicine. This paternity is divided with Zacchia, the Pope\u2019s physician, who taught in Italy and wrote in 1601 what can be considered the first medicolegal textbook (7). This was of decisive influence on the development of forensic sciences, as were the European codes of the 16th century (6): the Bamberg Code in 1507 and especially the Caroline Code in 1532, which obliged the courts to call specialized doctors to clarify forensic questions. Nevertheless, the 19th century was indeed a reference for modern legal medicine, born formally in many countries, almost at the same time: 1855 in Austria (6), 1872 in Hungary (8), 1886 in Brazil (7), 1887 in Great Britain (9,10), and 1889 in Portugal (when legal medicine was first referred to as being legally organized [11]). This century was really a golden age for forensic medicine (1,11), which knew a quick but supported growth, especially in France, Italy, and Germany (11). Besides, in German countries, forensic matters were always carefully treated, as can be proved by the early beginning of teaching forensic medicine in some universities in 1720 (11). The posterior development of forensic pathology was processed in accordance with the legal systems and sociopolitical conditions of each country. At the end of the 19th century, complementary sciences, such as toxicology and histology, were aggregate to forensic pathology, and from that union resulted the constitution of legal medicine institutes similar to the medicolegal units known today, where every type of expertise related to justice may be executed.\nLater, in the second half of the 20th century, a new medicolegal problem\narose in Europe and wherever roads and cars existed. The traffic accidents\nand the necessity of civil litigations of the injuries of the victims led to a new\nmedicolegal subspecialty concerning living people: clinical forensic medicine.

Perhaps it began with the Code of Hammurabi (1792\u20131750 BCE), which imposed sanctions for errors in medical and surgical practices. The same type of punishment also existed in Persia. Later on, the Visigoths promulgated laws that punished poisoning, infanticide, and homicide. Described as a medical trunk that serves the administration of justice, forensic medicine has different branches. Forensic pathology is probably the most emblematic one. Known in many Latin countries as tanathology (from the Greek word thanatos, meaning \u201cdeath\u2019s god\u201d), definitions of forensic pathology are often so broad that they would fit better into forensic medicine as a whole than in this single branch. For Di Maio (3), it is \u201ca branch of medicine that applies the principles and knowledge of the medical sciences in the field of law.\u201d An even larger conception of forensic pathology (4) considers it the study of diseases and injuries of the community, because it involves the knowledge of diagnosis and treatment in every medical specialty, but also requires information in many nonmedical areas, such as chemistry, physics, criminalistics and police sciences, motor vehicle and highway conception, politics, sociology, and even the way of life of a society. Closer to its objectives and limits, Williams et al. (5) define forensic pathology as a specialized branch of pathology (pathology being the study by scientific methods of disease and tissue injury) that relates within a legal framework to the effects of trauma, poisoning, occupational hazards, and natural disease. Introduction to Forensic Medicine 15 Forensic dissections of bodies began in the 13th century at the University of Bologna in Italy by a surgeon and teacher of anatomy, Saliceto (6). Surprisingly, these forensic dissections appeared before the hospital autopsies that started by the end of the 19th century with Rokitansky, Virchow, and the advent of the pathogenesis of diseases and cellular pathology (6). However, some authors (7) consider the French surgeon Ambrosio Par\u00e9, who in 1575 began a real scientific period in France, the father of legal medicine. This paternity is divided with Zacchia, the Pope\u2019s physician, who taught in Italy and wrote in 1601 what can be considered the first medicolegal textbook (7). This was of decisive influence on the development of forensic sciences, as were the European codes of the 16th century (6): the Bamberg Code in 1507 and especially the Caroline Code in 1532, which obliged the courts to call specialized doctors to clarify forensic questions. Nevertheless, the 19th century was indeed a reference for modern legal medicine, born formally in many countries, almost at the same time: 1855 in Austria (6), 1872 in Hungary (8), 1886 in Brazil (7), 1887 in Great Britain (9,10), and 1889 in Portugal (when legal medicine was first referred to as being legally organized [11]). This century was really a golden age for forensic medicine (1,11), which knew a quick but supported growth, especially in France, Italy, and Germany (11). Besides, in German countries, forensic matters were always carefully treated, as can be proved by the early beginning of teaching forensic medicine in some universities in 1720 (11). The posterior development of forensic pathology was processed in accordance with the legal systems and sociopolitical conditions of each country. At the end of the 19th century, complementary sciences, such as toxicology and histology, were aggregate to forensic pathology, and from that union resulted the constitution of legal medicine institutes similar to the medicolegal units known today, where every type of expertise related to justice may be executed.\nLater, in the second half of the 20th century, a new medicolegal problem\narose in Europe and wherever roads and cars existed. The traffic accidents\nand the necessity of civil litigations of the injuries of the victims led to a new\nmedicolegal subspecialty concerning living people: clinical forensic medicine. It started in Belgium and France with Derobert, Roche, Muller, and\nRousseau (12). Supported by the Deliberation 75 (7) of the Committee of\nMinisters of the Council of Europe, an \u201cexpertise-type\u201d was created (12,13)\nto achieve a global evaluation of consequences resulting from injuries caused\nby accidents to the body of an individual (as a whole being). This process was\ncrucial for the financial indemnity of the injuries by insurance companies.\nThese ideas, adopted in Portugal by Oliveira S\u00e1, a great enthusiast of this new\n16 Pinheiro\ndiscipline, were developed and \u201cexported\u201d to Spain through the excellent relationship he had with the forensic physicians in the neighbor country, where a\nhuge development took place; however, it was more as a private medical\nactivity than centralized in medicolegal institutions.

Metformin is in a class of drugs called biguanides. Metformin helps to control the amount of glucose (sugar) in your blood. It decreases the amount of glucose you absorb from your food and the amount of glucose made by your liver. Metformin also increases your body's response to insulin, a natural substance that controls the amount of glucose in the blood. Metformin is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood).\n \n\n Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Taking medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.\n \n\n How should this medicine be used?\n Metformin comes as a tablet, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet, and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. The solution is usually taken with meals one or two times a day. The regular tablet is usually taken with meals two or three times a day. The extended-release tablet is usually taken once daily with the evening meal. To help you remember to take metformin, take it around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take metformin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n \n\n Swallow metformin extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\n \n\n Your doctor may start you on a low dose of metformin and gradually increase your dose not more often than once every 1\u20132 weeks. You will need to monitor your blood sugar carefully so your doctor will be able to tell how well metformin is working.\n \n\n Metformin controls diabetes but does not cure it. Continue to take metformin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking metformin without talking to your doctor.\n \n\n Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.\n \n\n Other uses for this medicine\n This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n \n\n What special precautions should I follow?\n Before taking metformin,\n tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to metformin, any of the ingredients of metformin liquid or tablets, or any other medications. Ask your pharmacist or check the manufacturer's patient information for a list of the ingredients.\n tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n tell your doctor if you have or have ever had low levels of vitamin B12 in your body or any other medical conditions, especially those mentioned in the IMPORTANT WARNING section.\n tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking metformin, call your doctor.\n tell your doctor if you eat less or exercise more than usual. This can affect your blood sugar. Your doctor will give you instructions if this happens.\n What special dietary instructions should I follow?\n Be sure to follow all exercise and dietary recommendations made by your doctor or dietitian. It is important to eat a healthful diet.\n \n\n What should I do if I forget a dose?\n Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n \n\n What side effects can this medication cause?\n This medication may cause changes in your blood sugar. You should know the symptoms of low and high blood sugar and what to do if you have these symptoms.\n Metformin may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe, do not go away, go away and come back, or do not begin for some time after you begin taking metformin:\n diarrhea\n nausea\n stomach discomfort\n gas\n indigestion\n constipation\n lack of energy or weakness\n change in sense of taste\n headache\n Some side effects can be serious.

Metformin is not used to treat type 1 diabetes (condition in which the body does not produce insulin and therefore cannot control the amount of sugar in the blood).\n \n\n Over time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems. Taking medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.\n \n\n How should this medicine be used?\n Metformin comes as a tablet, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet, and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. The solution is usually taken with meals one or two times a day. The regular tablet is usually taken with meals two or three times a day. The extended-release tablet is usually taken once daily with the evening meal. To help you remember to take metformin, take it around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take metformin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\n \n\n Swallow metformin extended-release tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\n \n\n Your doctor may start you on a low dose of metformin and gradually increase your dose not more often than once every 1\u20132 weeks. You will need to monitor your blood sugar carefully so your doctor will be able to tell how well metformin is working.\n \n\n Metformin controls diabetes but does not cure it. Continue to take metformin even if you feel well. Do not stop taking metformin without talking to your doctor.\n \n\n Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.\n \n\n Other uses for this medicine\n This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.\n \n\n What special precautions should I follow?\n Before taking metformin,\n tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to metformin, any of the ingredients of metformin liquid or tablets, or any other medications. Ask your pharmacist or check the manufacturer's patient information for a list of the ingredients.\n tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.\n tell your doctor if you have or have ever had low levels of vitamin B12 in your body or any other medical conditions, especially those mentioned in the IMPORTANT WARNING section.\n tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking metformin, call your doctor.\n tell your doctor if you eat less or exercise more than usual. This can affect your blood sugar. Your doctor will give you instructions if this happens.\n What special dietary instructions should I follow?\n Be sure to follow all exercise and dietary recommendations made by your doctor or dietitian. It is important to eat a healthful diet.\n \n\n What should I do if I forget a dose?\n Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.\n \n\n What side effects can this medication cause?\n This medication may cause changes in your blood sugar. You should know the symptoms of low and high blood sugar and what to do if you have these symptoms.\n Metformin may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe, do not go away, go away and come back, or do not begin for some time after you begin taking metformin:\n diarrhea\n nausea\n stomach discomfort\n gas\n indigestion\n constipation\n lack of energy or weakness\n change in sense of taste\n headache\n Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms or those listed in the IMPORTANT WARNING section, call your doctor immediately or get emergency treatment:\n chest pain\n Metformin may cause other side effects. Call your doctor if you have any unusual problems while taking this medication.\n \n\n If you experience a serious side effect, you or your doctor may send a report to the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program online (https://www.fda.gov/Safety/MedWatch) or by phone (1-800-332-1088).\n https://medlineplus.gov/druginfo/meds/a696005.html\n \n\n ================\n <QUESTION>\n =======\n What is the medication Metformin used for and what are some potential side effects involved in its usage?

Software makers UiPath (PATH) and SentinelOne (S) reported Wednesday night, along with homebuilder Lennar (LEN).\n\nThe stock market rally had a constructive Wednesday. The Nasdaq fell but finished off lows and held the bulk of Tuesday's gains, much like AI rally leader Nvidia (NVDA). Many other big techs had quiet sessions after Tuesday's strong moves.\n\nLaggard Tesla (TSLA), however, broke lower, extending its long run of underperformance amid negative headlines.\n\nMarket breadth was solid.\n\nWhile AI stocks have clearly led the market rally, a number of stocks in the commodity, travel and medical product spaces are in buy areas now.\n\n\nFreeport-McMoRan (FCX), PBF Energy (PBF) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) cleared a buy point. Shockwave Medical (SWAV) and Dexcom (DXCM) remain in buy areas.\n\nHowever, bullish sentiment has reached excessive levels, suggesting a pullback is likely in the coming days. The market rally has refused to take extended breaks, staging \"cat nap\" pullbacks for a day or two before quickly revving higher again and looking extended again.\n\nNvidia and Dexcom stock are on IBD Leaderboard. Nvidia, SentinelOne and Royal Caribbean stock are on the IBD 50. Nvidia stock is on the IBD Big Cap 20.\n\nDexcom was Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day.\n\nDow Jones Futures Today\nDow Jones futures were 0.1% above fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.2%.\n\nRemember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.\n\nJoin IBD experts as they analyze leading stocks and the market on IBD Live\n\nEarnings\nLennar earnings topped while revenue fell short. LEN stock fell slightly overnight. Shares dipped 0.3% in Wednesday's regular session to 165.50 after hitting a record high intraday. Lennar stock slightly extended from a flat base with a 156.01 buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis.\n\nUiPath earnings topped with the automation software maker guiding lower on Q1 revenue but up for fiscal 2025. PATH stock rose slightly late after initially surging in volatile action. Shares dipped 0.85% to 24.43 on Wednesday, but held onto the recent move above the 50-day following a failed recent breakout. A move above Wednesday's high of 25.33 would offer an early entry.\n\nSentinelOne narrowly beat fiscal Q4 views, but guided slightly lower on fiscal 2025 revenue. Shares tumbled overnight. SentinelOne stock fell 1 cent to 27.94 on Wednesday, briefly testing a downward-sloping trendline. That offered an early entry in an emerging base, but the imminent earnings report made that risky.\n\nStock Market Rally\nThe stock market rally had a mixed session, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq falling modestly, ceding only a portion of Tuesday's gains.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1% in Wednesday's stock market trading. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index dipped 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite declined 0.5%, but it was an inside day to Tuesday's 1.5% pop. Nvidia fell 1.1% but was off lows in an inside day to Tuesday's 7.2% jump.\n\n\nThe small-cap Russell 2000 edged up 0.3%. Breadth was modestly positive, though decliners narrowly led on the Nasdaq.\n\nWhile Nvidia and many AI hardware plays are clearly extended, there are some software, commodity, medical product, financial, energy and travel names that are actionable or setting up.\n\nU.S. crude oil prices popped 2.8% to $79.72 a barrel. Gasoline futures gained 2.9% \u2014 5.3% this week \u2014 to their highest close in nearly six months.\n\nCopper futures jumped 3.25% to $4.0525 a pound, the highest close since April 2023. It was the biggest percentage gain since late 2022.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield rose 3.5 basis points to 4.19%.\n\nBullish Sentiment Excessive\nThe Investors Intelligence bulls-bears sentiment gauge is reaching euphoric levels. Some 60.9% of investment advisors are bullish, above the 60% level seen as excessive. That suggests a pullback, perhaps a more serious one, is coming. But it doesn't have to happen right away. That's the highest point since mid-2021. Just 14.5% are bearish, also the lowest since 2021.\n\nA modest pause or pullback over several days or even weeks would likely cool sentiment, let more bases form and give the market room for a longer run. But that hasn't been the market's pattern.\n\nETFs\nAmong growth ETFs, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) fell 0.7%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) slumped 2%. Nvidia stock is the No. 1 holding in SMH.\n\nReflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) edged up 0.2% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) rose 0.3%. Tesla stock is a major holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. UiPath also is a big Cathie Wood stock.\n\nSPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) edged higher, with FCX stock in the ETF. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) ascended 0.7%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) stepped up 1.5%, with Lennar stock a key holding. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) rallied 1.6% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) fell 0.4%.\n\nThe Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) gained 0.3%. And the Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) climbed 0.7%.\n\nTime The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy\n\nStocks In Buy Areas\nFreeport-McMoRan stock gapped up 7.6% to 43.41, Wednesday's top S&P 500 performer. The copper and gold miner broke above a double-bottom base buy point of 40.99, closing out of range. However, on a weekly chart, FCX stock just topped a 43.42 cup-with-handle buy point.\n\nSouthern Copper (SCCO) and more-diversified Teck Resources (TECK) also cleared bases Wednesday.\n\n\nPBF Energy stock leapt 9% to 54.96, clearing a 54.52 cup-with-handle buy point. PBF stock is 16% above its 50-day line. Refining peer Phillips 66 (PSX) decisively cleared a short consolidation Wednesday, while several oil and gas machinery and services firms have been actionable.\n\nShockwave Medical stock climbed 1.8% to 269.37, testing the top of a short consolidation following an earnings gap from the 200-day line. SWAV stock already was actionable from breaking a downtrend in this recent action, which could be viewed as a handle to a huge base.\n\n\nDexcom stock fell 2.7% to 131.68, falling just below a 132.03 buy point from a flat base within a much larger consolidation.\n\nRoyal Caribbean stock climbed 1.8% to 132.11, clearing a 130.97 buy point from a messy flat base. Meanwhile, rival cruise line operator Carnival (CCL) cleared an aggressive entry while hotel giant Marriott Worldwide (MAR) is trying to clear a tight pattern.\n\nTesla Stock\nTesla stock skidded 4.5% to 169.50, hitting the lowest levels since last May. Shares have tumbled nearly 32% in 2024, the worst performer on the S&P 500 index. The relative strength line is at a 14-month low, reflecting Tesla's severe underperformance vs. the S&P 500 index in recent months. The RS line is the blue line in the charts provided.\n\n\nBefore Wednesday's open, Wells Fargo downgraded Tesla to underweight and cut its price target to 125 from 200.

Software makers UiPath (PATH) and SentinelOne (S) reported Wednesday night, along with homebuilder Lennar (LEN).\n\nThe stock market rally had a constructive Wednesday. The Nasdaq fell but finished off lows and held the bulk of Tuesday's gains, much like AI rally leader Nvidia (NVDA). Many other big techs had quiet sessions after Tuesday's strong moves.\n\nLaggard Tesla (TSLA), however, broke lower, extending its long run of underperformance amid negative headlines.\n\nMarket breadth was solid.\n\nWhile AI stocks have clearly led the market rally, a number of stocks in the commodity, travel and medical product spaces are in buy areas now.\n\n\nFreeport-McMoRan (FCX), PBF Energy (PBF) and Royal Caribbean (RCL) cleared a buy point. Shockwave Medical (SWAV) and Dexcom (DXCM) remain in buy areas.\n\nHowever, bullish sentiment has reached excessive levels, suggesting a pullback is likely in the coming days. The market rally has refused to take extended breaks, staging \"cat nap\" pullbacks for a day or two before quickly revving higher again and looking extended again.\n\nNvidia and Dexcom stock are on IBD Leaderboard. Nvidia, SentinelOne and Royal Caribbean stock are on the IBD 50. Nvidia stock is on the IBD Big Cap 20.\n\nDexcom was Wednesday's IBD Stock Of The Day.\n\nDow Jones Futures Today\nDow Jones futures were 0.1% above fair value. S&P 500 futures climbed 0.1% and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 0.2%.\n\nRemember that overnight action in Dow futures and elsewhere doesn't necessarily translate into actual trading in the next regular stock market session.\n\nJoin IBD experts as they analyze leading stocks and the market on IBD Live\n\nEarnings\nLennar earnings topped while revenue fell short. LEN stock fell slightly overnight. Shares dipped 0.3% in Wednesday's regular session to 165.50 after hitting a record high intraday. Lennar stock slightly extended from a flat base with a 156.01 buy point, according to MarketSmith analysis.\n\nUiPath earnings topped with the automation software maker guiding lower on Q1 revenue but up for fiscal 2025. PATH stock rose slightly late after initially surging in volatile action. Shares dipped 0.85% to 24.43 on Wednesday, but held onto the recent move above the 50-day following a failed recent breakout. A move above Wednesday's high of 25.33 would offer an early entry.\n\nSentinelOne narrowly beat fiscal Q4 views, but guided slightly lower on fiscal 2025 revenue. Shares tumbled overnight. SentinelOne stock fell 1 cent to 27.94 on Wednesday, briefly testing a downward-sloping trendline. That offered an early entry in an emerging base, but the imminent earnings report made that risky.\n\nStock Market Rally\nThe stock market rally had a mixed session, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq falling modestly, ceding only a portion of Tuesday's gains.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.1% in Wednesday's stock market trading. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index dipped 0.2%. The Nasdaq composite declined 0.5%, but it was an inside day to Tuesday's 1.5% pop. Nvidia fell 1.1% but was off lows in an inside day to Tuesday's 7.2% jump.\n\n\nThe small-cap Russell 2000 edged up 0.3%. Breadth was modestly positive, though decliners narrowly led on the Nasdaq.\n\nWhile Nvidia and many AI hardware plays are clearly extended, there are some software, commodity, medical product, financial, energy and travel names that are actionable or setting up.\n\nU.S. crude oil prices popped 2.8% to $79.72 a barrel. Gasoline futures gained 2.9% \u2014 5.3% this week \u2014 to their highest close in nearly six months.\n\nCopper futures jumped 3.25% to $4.0525 a pound, the highest close since April 2023. It was the biggest percentage gain since late 2022.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield rose 3.5 basis points to 4.19%.\n\nBullish Sentiment Excessive\nThe Investors Intelligence bulls-bears sentiment gauge is reaching euphoric levels. Some 60.9% of investment advisors are bullish, above the 60% level seen as excessive. That suggests a pullback, perhaps a more serious one, is coming. But it doesn't have to happen right away. That's the highest point since mid-2021. Just 14.5% are bearish, also the lowest since 2021.\n\nA modest pause or pullback over several days or even weeks would likely cool sentiment, let more bases form and give the market room for a longer run. But that hasn't been the market's pattern.\n\nETFs\nAmong growth ETFs, the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) fell 0.7%. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) slumped 2%. Nvidia stock is the No. 1 holding in SMH.\n\nReflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) edged up 0.2% and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) rose 0.3%. Tesla stock is a major holding across Ark Invest's ETFs. UiPath also is a big Cathie Wood stock.\n\nSPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) edged higher, with FCX stock in the ETF. U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS) ascended 0.7%. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) stepped up 1.5%, with Lennar stock a key holding. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) rallied 1.6% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) fell 0.4%.\n\nThe Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) gained 0.3%. And the Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) climbed 0.7%.\n\nTime The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy\n\nStocks In Buy Areas\nFreeport-McMoRan stock gapped up 7.6% to 43.41, Wednesday's top S&P 500 performer. The copper and gold miner broke above a double-bottom base buy point of 40.99, closing out of range. However, on a weekly chart, FCX stock just topped a 43.42 cup-with-handle buy point.\n\nSouthern Copper (SCCO) and more-diversified Teck Resources (TECK) also cleared bases Wednesday.\n\n\nPBF Energy stock leapt 9% to 54.96, clearing a 54.52 cup-with-handle buy point. PBF stock is 16% above its 50-day line. Refining peer Phillips 66 (PSX) decisively cleared a short consolidation Wednesday, while several oil and gas machinery and services firms have been actionable.\n\nShockwave Medical stock climbed 1.8% to 269.37, testing the top of a short consolidation following an earnings gap from the 200-day line. SWAV stock already was actionable from breaking a downtrend in this recent action, which could be viewed as a handle to a huge base.\n\n\nDexcom stock fell 2.7% to 131.68, falling just below a 132.03 buy point from a flat base within a much larger consolidation.\n\nRoyal Caribbean stock climbed 1.8% to 132.11, clearing a 130.97 buy point from a messy flat base. Meanwhile, rival cruise line operator Carnival (CCL) cleared an aggressive entry while hotel giant Marriott Worldwide (MAR) is trying to clear a tight pattern.\n\nTesla Stock\nTesla stock skidded 4.5% to 169.50, hitting the lowest levels since last May. Shares have tumbled nearly 32% in 2024, the worst performer on the S&P 500 index. The relative strength line is at a 14-month low, reflecting Tesla's severe underperformance vs. the S&P 500 index in recent months. The RS line is the blue line in the charts provided.\n\n\nBefore Wednesday's open, Wells Fargo downgraded Tesla to underweight and cut its price target to 125 from 200. The analyst joined a recent rush to slash first-quarter delivery targets. He now sees 2024 earnings per share nearly a third below consensus. And he expects deliveries to fall short. Wells Fargo also said a yet-unveiled cheap EV may be not be a boon for Tesla, citing \"likely tough\" economics.\n\nLate Wednesday, UBS cut its Tesla price target to 165 from 225, also slashing its first-quarter delivery targets. TSLA stock fell a fraction overnight.\n\nFisker (FSR) plunged more than 40% late Wednesday, on a report that the U.S. EV startup and would-be Tesla rival is preparing for a possible bankruptcy filing."}

The Mashantucket Pequot Nation, which operates the Foxwoods casino, defaulted in 2009 and completed the restructuring of its debt of $2 billion on July 1, 2013.81 According to recent news reports, Foxwoods remains in a precarious financial position, with outstanding loans of around $1.7 billion.82 The Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority, which refinanced $1.64 billion of long term debt in March 2012, announced layoffs involving hundreds of employees at the Mohegan Sun in several years since then.83 Because tribes are sovereign nations, there are emerging complications for lenders. For example, the Mohegan tribe\u2019s constitution gives its Gaming Disputes Court, made up of a trial court and an appeals court, exclusive jurisdiction over disputes involving gambling. The Mohegan Sun 2015 Annual Report spelled out some of the potential legal issues:\nWe, the Tribe and our wholly-owned subsidiaries may not be subject to, or permitted to seek protection under, the federal bankruptcy laws since an Indian tribe and we, as an instrumentality of the Tribe, may not be a \u201cperson\u201d eligible to be a debtor under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, our creditors may not be able to seek liquidation of our assets or other action under federal bankruptcy laws. Also, the Gaming Disputes Court may lack powers typically associated with a federal bankruptcy court, such as the power to non-consensually alter liabilities, direct the priority of creditors\u2019 payments and liquidate certain assets. The Gaming Disputes Court is a court of limited jurisdiction and may not have jurisdiction over all creditors of ours or our subsidiaries or over all of the territory in which we and our subsidiaries carry on business.84\nAn ongoing dispute between Wells Fargo Bank and Saybrook Investors LLC, and Wisconsin\u2019s Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians could affect gaming financing. Wells Fargo has sued the tribe over its failure to make monthly payments on a $50 million tribal bond to consolidate debt and invest in a riverboat casino operation in Mississippi. The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin in 2010 found that the bond deal was invalid because it had not been reviewed by the National Indian Gaming Commission, as the court said was required under IGRA.85 The complicated and long running dispute has continued after a remand in September 2011 by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.86 It may take more years and possibly afew more appeals for a ruling on the validity of the bond documents other than the bond indenture.87\nPari Mutuel Betting\nLegal in 43 states,88 pari mutuel betting is defined as \u201cplayer banked betting with all the bets pooled and prizes awarded from the pool.\u201d89 The most common examples in the United States are dog and horse racing and jai alai (a game played on a court with a ball and wicker racket), and other sporting events in which participants finish in ranked order.\nIn recent years, the industry has developed an extensive system of Internet and off track wagering. In 2000, Congress approved legislation to amend the definition of \u201cinterstate off track wager\u201d in the Interstate Horseracing Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a73001 3007). Proponents claim the amendment permits tracks to accept bets online from individuals located in states where pari\nmutuel betting is legal (although not necessarily where either off track or online betting is legal); the Department of Justice disagrees.90 A bill introduced in the 114th Congress, H.R. 707, would have clarified that the Wire Act and other laws do not apply to the Interstate Horseracing Act.\nDespite the legal uncertainty, interstate pari mutuel betting with remote devices is growing through the use of advance deposit wagering (ADW). Players first set up accounts with companies such as Twinspires (owned by the Churchill Downs racetrack), Xpressbet, or TV Games Network. They then use the accounts to place bets on races over the phone, on a computer, with mobile devices, or with set top remote control devices linked to television channels that broadcast horse racing. The Oregon Racing Commission, which licenses and audits many of the largest firms taking advance deposit wagers, reports that online wagering via its licensed companies rose to $2.9 billion in 2015, from $962 million in 2005.91\nSports Betting\nCongress in 1992 passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA; P.L. 102\n559) with strong support from the National Basketball Association, the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association, among others. The law generally barred state governments from licensing, sponsoring, operating, advertising, promoting, or engaging in sports gambling.92 It contained exceptions for Nevada, Oregon, Delaware, and Montana, each of which allowed certain types ofsports betting at the time of passage.93 New Jersey failed to pass legislation in time to qualify for the PASPA exemption. Currently, Nevada is the only state to permit wagers on a full complement of sporting events and leagues.94 According to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Center for Gaming Research, casino goers in Nevada wagered about $4.2 billion on sporting events in 2015, a rise from $3.4 billion in 2012.95\nDelaware, which allowed only limited multigame or parlay betting96 on NFL contests at the time the 1992 law was passed, enacted a law in 2009 to create a state sports lottery. The NFL and other sports leagues challenged the law, and the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the state was limited to offering narrow betting, similar to what existed in 1992. The U.S. Supreme Court in May 2010 declined to hear an appeal, effectively ending Delaware\u2019s effort to expand sports betting.97 After its voters authorized sports betting at casinos and racetracks in 2011, New Jersey mounted other court challenges to the constitutionality of PASPA.98 In February 2016, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that New Jersey\u2019s sports wagering law conflicts with PASPA and could not be implemented.99 The Supreme Court may consider whether to hear New Jersey\u2019s appeal of the lower court ruling.100 According to an estimate by AGA, Americans spent around $150 billion on illegal sports betting in 2015.101\nTwo bills have been introduced in the 114th Congress related to sports gambling. The New Jersey Betting and Equal Treatment Act of 2015 (H.R. 457) would expressly exempt New Jersey from PASPA. The Sports Gaming Opportunity Act (H.R. 416) would create an exemption from the PASPA prohibitions for any state that establishes sports gambling through laws enacted on or after January 1, 2015, and that go into effect no later than January 1, 2019.\nRegulation of Internet Gambling\nFederal Internet gambling legislation could benefit some sectors of the gambling industry more than others, depending on how it is crafted. State lottery officials, for example, have expressed concern that proposals that would give existing gambling establishments preference for online poker licenses could give those businesses an advantage in the market.102 By the same token, commercial casinos are worried that under the existing legal framework, online state lottery promotions, such as keno type games, could encroach on their turf. If the United States passes federal online gambling legislation and all states opt in during the next 12 months, H2 Gambling Capital predicts a U.S. online gambling market of $15 billion to $16 billion by 2021.103\nInterest groups and gambling companies are at odds over remote gambling. One of the strongest proponents of legalized online poker is the Poker Players Alliance.104 Caesars Entertainment and MGM are among the large casino operators that have urged Congress to adopt federal legislation to regulate Internet gambling to avoid a patchwork of state regulations and different tax rates. These interests formed the Coalition for Consumer and Online Protection in 2014.105 Aligned against them are others, including most prominently the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling.106 The North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries (NASPL)107 and the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL)108 want individual states to have the right to legalize, license, and tax Internet gambling.109 In 2015, the National Council of Legislators from Gaming States (NCLGS) adopted a list of 10 policy standards for Internet gambling legislation addressing topics such as player protections, taxation, licensing, enforcement, payment processing, and geolocation standards.110 The National Governors Association largely echoes this view, and it has called on lawmakers to include state input before acting on any online gambling legislation.111\nMany Indian tribes have declared their opposition to any federal gambling regime, although some of the larger tribes are now beginning to reverse their previous positions, viewing online gambling as a possible business opportunity.", "full_prompt": "System instruction: [Your answer must solely be derived from the information in the prompt itself.

For example, the Mohegan tribe\u2019s constitution gives its Gaming Disputes Court, made up of a trial court and an appeals court, exclusive jurisdiction over disputes involving gambling. The Mohegan Sun 2015 Annual Report spelled out some of the potential legal issues:\nWe, the Tribe and our wholly-owned subsidiaries may not be subject to, or permitted to seek protection under, the federal bankruptcy laws since an Indian tribe and we, as an instrumentality of the Tribe, may not be a \u201cperson\u201d eligible to be a debtor under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Therefore, our creditors may not be able to seek liquidation of our assets or other action under federal bankruptcy laws. Also, the Gaming Disputes Court may lack powers typically associated with a federal bankruptcy court, such as the power to non-consensually alter liabilities, direct the priority of creditors\u2019 payments and liquidate certain assets. The Gaming Disputes Court is a court of limited jurisdiction and may not have jurisdiction over all creditors of ours or our subsidiaries or over all of the territory in which we and our subsidiaries carry on business.84\nAn ongoing dispute between Wells Fargo Bank and Saybrook Investors LLC, and Wisconsin\u2019s Lac du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians could affect gaming financing. Wells Fargo has sued the tribe over its failure to make monthly payments on a $50 million tribal bond to consolidate debt and invest in a riverboat casino operation in Mississippi. The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin in 2010 found that the bond deal was invalid because it had not been reviewed by the National Indian Gaming Commission, as the court said was required under IGRA.85 The complicated and long running dispute has continued after a remand in September 2011 by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.86 It may take more years and possibly afew more appeals for a ruling on the validity of the bond documents other than the bond indenture.87\nPari Mutuel Betting\nLegal in 43 states,88 pari mutuel betting is defined as \u201cplayer banked betting with all the bets pooled and prizes awarded from the pool.\u201d89 The most common examples in the United States are dog and horse racing and jai alai (a game played on a court with a ball and wicker racket), and other sporting events in which participants finish in ranked order.\nIn recent years, the industry has developed an extensive system of Internet and off track wagering. In 2000, Congress approved legislation to amend the definition of \u201cinterstate off track wager\u201d in the Interstate Horseracing Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a73001 3007). Proponents claim the amendment permits tracks to accept bets online from individuals located in states where pari\nmutuel betting is legal (although not necessarily where either off track or online betting is legal); the Department of Justice disagrees.90 A bill introduced in the 114th Congress, H.R. 707, would have clarified that the Wire Act and other laws do not apply to the Interstate Horseracing Act.\nDespite the legal uncertainty, interstate pari mutuel betting with remote devices is growing through the use of advance deposit wagering (ADW). Players first set up accounts with companies such as Twinspires (owned by the Churchill Downs racetrack), Xpressbet, or TV Games Network. They then use the accounts to place bets on races over the phone, on a computer, with mobile devices, or with set top remote control devices linked to television channels that broadcast horse racing. The Oregon Racing Commission, which licenses and audits many of the largest firms taking advance deposit wagers, reports that online wagering via its licensed companies rose to $2.9 billion in 2015, from $962 million in 2005.91\nSports Betting\nCongress in 1992 passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA; P.L. 102\n559) with strong support from the National Basketball Association, the National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball, the National Hockey League, and the National Collegiate Athletic Association, among others. The law generally barred state governments from licensing, sponsoring, operating, advertising, promoting, or engaging in sports gambling.92 It contained exceptions for Nevada, Oregon, Delaware, and Montana, each of which allowed certain types ofsports betting at the time of passage.93 New Jersey failed to pass legislation in time to qualify for the PASPA exemption. Currently, Nevada is the only state to permit wagers on a full complement of sporting events and leagues.94 According to the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Center for Gaming Research, casino goers in Nevada wagered about $4.2 billion on sporting events in 2015, a rise from $3.4 billion in 2012.95\nDelaware, which allowed only limited multigame or parlay betting96 on NFL contests at the time the 1992 law was passed, enacted a law in 2009 to create a state sports lottery. The NFL and other sports leagues challenged the law, and the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the state was limited to offering narrow betting, similar to what existed in 1992. The U.S. Supreme Court in May 2010 declined to hear an appeal, effectively ending Delaware\u2019s effort to expand sports betting.97 After its voters authorized sports betting at casinos and racetracks in 2011, New Jersey mounted other court challenges to the constitutionality of PASPA.98 In February 2016, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that New Jersey\u2019s sports wagering law conflicts with PASPA and could not be implemented.99 The Supreme Court may consider whether to hear New Jersey\u2019s appeal of the lower court ruling.100 According to an estimate by AGA, Americans spent around $150 billion on illegal sports betting in 2015.101\nTwo bills have been introduced in the 114th Congress related to sports gambling. The New Jersey Betting and Equal Treatment Act of 2015 (H.R. 457) would expressly exempt New Jersey from PASPA. The Sports Gaming Opportunity Act (H.R. 416) would create an exemption from the PASPA prohibitions for any state that establishes sports gambling through laws enacted on or after January 1, 2015, and that go into effect no later than January 1, 2019.\nRegulation of Internet Gambling\nFederal Internet gambling legislation could benefit some sectors of the gambling industry more than others, depending on how it is crafted. State lottery officials, for example, have expressed concern that proposals that would give existing gambling establishments preference for online poker licenses could give those businesses an advantage in the market.102 By the same token, commercial casinos are worried that under the existing legal framework, online state lottery promotions, such as keno type games, could encroach on their turf. If the United States passes federal online gambling legislation and all states opt in during the next 12 months, H2 Gambling Capital predicts a U.S. online gambling market of $15 billion to $16 billion by 2021.103\nInterest groups and gambling companies are at odds over remote gambling. One of the strongest proponents of legalized online poker is the Poker Players Alliance.104 Caesars Entertainment and MGM are among the large casino operators that have urged Congress to adopt federal legislation to regulate Internet gambling to avoid a patchwork of state regulations and different tax rates. These interests formed the Coalition for Consumer and Online Protection in 2014.105 Aligned against them are others, including most prominently the Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling.106 The North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries (NASPL)107 and the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL)108 want individual states to have the right to legalize, license, and tax Internet gambling.109 In 2015, the National Council of Legislators from Gaming States (NCLGS) adopted a list of 10 policy standards for Internet gambling legislation addressing topics such as player protections, taxation, licensing, enforcement, payment processing, and geolocation standards.110 The National Governors Association largely echoes this view, and it has called on lawmakers to include state input before acting on any online gambling legislation.111\nMany Indian tribes have declared their opposition to any federal gambling regime, although some of the larger tribes are now beginning to reverse their previous positions, viewing online gambling as a possible business opportunity.]"}
{"system_instruction": "Use information present in the text to support your response. Do not use outside information.", "user_request": "What does the attached document have to say about the prognosis of someone diagnosed with malignant MS?", "context_document": "**What is multiple sclerosis?**\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common disabling neurological disease of young adults with symptom onset generally occurring between the ages of 20 to 40 years.\n\nIn MS, the immune system cells that normally protect us from viruses, bacteria, and unhealthy cells mistakenly attack myelin in the central nervous system (brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord). Myelin is a substance that makes up the protective sheath (myelin sheath) that coats nerve fibers (axons).\n\nMS is a chronic disease that affects people differently. A small number of people with MS will have a mild course with little to no disability, whereas others will have a steadily worsening disease that leads to increased disability over time. Most people with MS, however, will have short periods of symptoms followed by long stretches of relative quiescence (inactivity or dormancy), with partial or full recovery. The disease is rarely fatal and most people with MS have a normal life expectancy.\n\nMyelin and the immune system\n\nMS attacks axons in the central nervous system protected by myelin, which are commonly called white matter. MS also damages the nerve cell bodies, which are found in the brain's gray matter, as well as the axons themselves in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves that transmit visual information from the eye to the brain. As the disease progresses, the outermost layer of the brain, called the cerebral cortex, shrinks in a process known as cortical atrophy.\n\nThe term multiple sclerosis refers to the distinctive areas of scar tissue (sclerosis\u2014also called plaques or lesions) that result from the attack on myelin by the immune system. These plaques are visible using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Plaques can be as small as a pinhead or as large as a golf ball.\n\nThe symptoms of MS depend on the severity of the inflammatory reaction as well as the location and extent of the plaques, which primarily appear in the brain stem, cerebellum (involved with balance and coordination of movement, among other functions), spinal cord, optic nerves, and the white matter around the brain ventricles (fluid-filled cavaties).\n\nSigns and symptoms of MS\n\nThe natural course of MS is different for each person, which makes it difficult to predict. The onset and duration of MS symptoms usually depend on the specific type but may begin over a few days and go away quickly or develop more slowly and gradually over many years.\n\nThere are four main types of MS, named according to the progression of symptoms over time:\n\nRelapsing-remitting MS\u2014Symptoms in this type come in the form of attacks. In between attacks, people recover or return to their usual level of disability. When symptoms occur in this form of MS, it is called an attack, a relapse, or exacerbation. The periods of disease inactivity between MS attacks are referred to as remission. Weeks, months, or even years may pass before another attack occurs, followed again by a period of inactivity. Most people with MS are initially diagnosed with this form of the disease.\nSecondary-progressive MS\u2014People with this form of MS usually have had a previous history of MS attacks but then start to develop gradual and steady symptoms and deterioration in their function over time. Most individuals with severe relapsing-remitting MS may go on to develop secondary progressive MS if they are untreated.\nPrimary-progressive MS\u2014This type of MS is less common and is characterized by progressively worsening symptoms from the beginning with no noticeable relapses or exacerbations of the disease, although there may be temporary or minor relief from symptoms.\nProgressive-relapsing MS\u2014The rarest form of MS is characterized by a steady worsening of symptoms from the beginning with acute relapses that can occur over time during the disease course.\nThere are some rare and unusual variants of MS, such as:\n\nMarburg variant MS (also known as malignant MS) causes swift and relentless symptoms and decline in function, and may result in significant disability or even death shortly after disease onset.\nBalo's concentric sclerosis causes concentric rings of myelin destruction that can be seen on an MRI and is another variant type of MS that can progress rapidly.\nEarly MS symptoms often include:\n\nVision problems such as blurred or double vision, or optic neuritis, which causes pain with eye movement and rapid vision loss\nMuscle weakness, often in the hands and legs, and muscle stiffness accompanied by painful muscle spasms\nTingling, numbness, or pain in the arms, legs, trunk, or face\nClumsiness, especially difficulty staying balanced when walking\nBladder control problems\nIntermittent or constant dizziness\nMS may also cause later symptoms, such as:\n\nMental or physical fatigue which accompanies the early symptoms during an attack\nMood changes such as depression or difficulty with emotional expression or control\nCognitive dysfunction\u2014problems concentrating, multitasking, thinking, learning, or difficulties with memory or judgment\nMuscle weakness, stiffness, and spasms may be severe enough to affect walking or standing. In some cases, MS leads to partial or complete paralysis and the use of a wheelchair is not uncommon, particularly in individuals who are untreated or have advanced disease. Many people with MS find that weakness and fatigue are worse when they have a fever or when they are exposed to heat. MS exacerbations may occur following common infections.\n\nPain is rarely the first sign of MS but pain often occurs with optic neuritis and trigeminal neuralgia, a disorder that affects one of the nerves that provides sensation to different parts of the face. Painful limb spasms and sharp pain shooting down the legs or around the abdomen can also be symptoms of MS.\n\nGenetic susceptibility\n\nMS itself is not inherited, but susceptibility to MS may be inherited. Studies show that some individuals with MS have one or more family member or relative who also have MS.\n\nCurrent research suggests that dozens of genes and possibly hundreds of variations in the genetic code (gene variants) combine to create vulnerability to MS. Some of these genes have been identified, and most are associated with functions of the immune system. Many of the known genes are similar to those that have been identified in people with other autoimmune diseases as type 1 diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, or lupus.\n\nInfectious factors and viruses\n\nSeveral viruses have been found in people with MS, but the virus most consistently linked to the development of MS is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) which causes infectious mononucleosis.\n\nOnly about five percent of the population has not been infected by EBV. These individuals are at a lower risk for developing MS than those who have been infected. People who were infected with EBV in adolescence or adulthood, and who therefore develop an exaggerated immune response to EBV, are at a significantly higher risk for developing MS than those who were infected in early childhood. This suggests that it may be the type of immune response to EBV that may lead to MS, rather than EBV infection itself. However, there is still no proof that EBV causes MS and the mechanisms that underlie this process are poorly understood.\n\nEnvironmental factors\n\nSeveral studies indicate that people who spend more time in the sun and those with relatively higher levels of vitamin D are less likely to develop MS or have a less severe course of disease and fewer relapses. Bright sunlight helps human skin produce vitamin D. Researchers believe that vitamin D may help regulate the immune system in ways that reduce the risk of MS or autoimmunity in general. People from regions near the equator, where there is a great deal of bright sunlight, generally have a much lower risk of MS than people from temperate areas such as the U.S. and Canada.\n\nStudies have found that people who smoke are more likely to develop MS and have a more aggressive disease course. Indeed, people who smoke tend to have more brain lesions and brain shrinkage than non-smokers. \n\nHow is multiple sclerosis diagnosed and treated?\nDiagnosing MS\n\nThere is no single test used to diagnose MS. The disease is confirmed when symptoms and signs develop and are related to different parts of the nervous system at more than one interval and after other alternative diagnoses have been excluded.\n\nDoctors use different tests to rule out or confirm the diagnosis. In addition to a complete medical history, physical examination, and a detailed neurological examination, a doctor may recommend:\n\nMRI scans of the brain and spinal cord to look for the characteristic lesions of MS. A special dye or contrast agent may be injected into a vein to enhance brain images of the active MS lesions.\nLumbar puncture (sometimes called a spinal tap) to obtain a sample of cerebrospinal fluid and examine it for proteins and inflammatory cells associated with the disease. Spinal tap analysis also can rule out diseases that may look like MS.\nEvoked potential tests, which use electrodes placed on the skin and painless electric signals to measure how quickly and accurately the nervous system responds to stimulation.\nTreating MS\n\nThere is no cure for MS, but there are treatments that can reduce the number and severity of relapses and delay the long-term disability progression of the disease.\n\nCorticosteroids, such as intravenous (infused into a vein) methylprednisolone, are prescribed over the course of three to five days. Intravenous steroids quickly and potently suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. They may be followed by a tapered dose of oral corticosteroids. Clinical trials have shown that these drugs hasten recovery from MS attacks, but do not alter the long-term outcome of the disease.\nPlasma exchange (plasmapheresis) can treat severe flare-ups in people with relapsing forms of MS who do not have a good response to methylprednisolone. Plasma exchange involves taking blood out of the body and removing components in the blood's plasma that are thought to be harmful. The rest of the blood, plus replacement plasma, is then transfused back into the body. This treatment has not been shown to be effective for secondary progressive or chronic progressive MS.\nDisease-modifying treatments\n\nCurrent therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for MS are designed to modulate or suppress the inflammatory reactions of the disease. They are most effective for relapsing-remitting MS at early stages of the disease.", "full_prompt": "[Article]\n==========\n**What is multiple sclerosis?**\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common disabling neurological disease of young adults with symptom onset generally occurring between the ages of 20 to 40 years.\n\nIn MS, the immune system cells that normally protect us from viruses, bacteria, and unhealthy cells mistakenly attack myelin in the central nervous system (brain, optic nerves, and spinal cord).

How should individuals prepare for these changes?", "context_document": "Reference Text:\n Inflation has slowed and the labor market has softened enough to satisfy the Federal Reserve. That means the central bank is about to cut interest rates.\n \n\n On Aug. 23, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, \u201cThe time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\u201d In other words, Americans should prepare to finally catch a break when it comes to borrowing to pay for a home, buy a car or open a new credit card. There are also other implications for the health of the broader economy.\n \n\n Back in March 2022, the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) began to increase the federal funds rate in response to growing inflation. It hiked rates 11 times before finally pausing. The rates, set at 5.25% to 5.50%, haven\u2019t budged since July 2023.\n \n\n The first cut will almost certainly happen at the Fed\u2019s upcoming meeting scheduled for Sept. 17-18. The futures market\u2019s CME FedWatch Tool now predicts a 87% likelihood that the FOMC will cut the current target rate by 25 basis points; it predicts a 13% likelihood of a larger cut of 50 basis points.\n \n\n But even if the Fed trims rates next week as expected, the target will still be a long way from the near-zero rate of early 2020 and immediate effects will be muted. Mortgage rates have already been easing in anticipation of a cut, for example, and most consumer credit and lending products are more dependent on your credit score than on the Fed rate. Still, this is viewed as a significant event and could build expectations for more cuts down the road.\n \n\n So what happens next? NerdWallet writers teamed up to explain how upcoming Fed rate cuts could impact your personal finances and what you can do to prepare. Credit card interest rates are variable, meaning they adjust up or down shortly after the Fed changes the federal funds rate. So if the Fed lowers interest rates, credit card debt will cost slightly less.\n \n\n The operative word here is \u201cslightly.\u201d Credit card debt is expensive no matter what the federal funds rate happens to be. Let\u2019s say you have an average balance of $5,000 on a card charging 25% APR. You\u2019ll spend around $1,250 in interest over the course of a year. If your interest rate was 24% instead, that\u2019s just $50 less in interest for the year. Point being, a rate reduction doesn\u2019t translate to a massive savings in interest when it comes to credit cards.\n \n\n Still, you can use the upcoming Fed news as a reminder to check in on your debt and make a plan to pay it down as aggressively as you can. If you qualify, a balance transfer credit card could give you a year or more without interest. Lower interest rates might make a personal loan a compelling debt consolidation option. Mortgage interest rates have already headed lower ahead of any action by the Fed. In April, the average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate loan was 7.04%. August's average was nearly three-quarters of a percentage point lower, at 6.31%. That 73-basis-point drop is larger than any anticipated rate cut, but rates may push even lower once the central bankers start chopping.\n \n\n Homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages or home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) should see savings right away as their interest rates ratchet downward. But lower mortgage interest rates might also be a boon to homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages. Those who bought when rates were higher could finally see a significant benefit from refinancing, while owners who feel tethered by their current low mortgage rates may feel more confident about making a move. Reducing that rate \"lock in\" effect could put more homes on the market, particularly at the starter-home level. Prospective home buyers likely feel heartened by the prospect of rate cuts, but a quarter or even half of a percentage point cut from the Federal Reserve shouldn't cause a sudden drop in mortgage rates, especially with a downward trend already in progress. So, don't wait on the Fed: Buy when you're ready, not when interest rates are. While you're preparing to buy \u2014 and during your home search \u2014 work on your finances. Continue to pay down high-interest debt, try to build your credit score, don't take out new loans and keep making on-time payments. That way, when you're applying for a mortgage, you'll be in a strong position to get a lender's best possible interest rate regardless of where prevailing rates are. Auto loan interest rates typically follow the path of the Fed rate, but it can take time to see. When car loan rates do begin to fall, will it be a good time to buy or refinance? Here are some considerations to help you decide.\n \n\n Your APR on a car loan is determined by many factors, such as your credit history, credit score, loan term and vehicle age. Taking time to improve your credit, or to find a slightly used car rather than a new one, is likely to affect your loan rate more than a slight drop in the Fed rate.\n \n\n From the car-buying perspective, your interest rate is just one part of your monthly payment, which also includes the amount you borrow to pay for the car. In July, the average transaction price for new cars was $48,401, with an average monthly payment of $753. The average listing price for used cars was $25,415. Car prices have improved compared to a year ago, but they still remain higher than pre-pandemic levels. Even when interest rates drop, you will want to focus on a vehicle\u2019s out-the-door price and whether the resulting monthly payment fits your budget.\n \n\n If you financed a car at a high interest rate, refinancing could be a way to lower the rate and your monthly payment. In general, lenders recommend reducing your rate by 1% or more, without extending the loan term, to get the most out of refinancing. And you\u2019ll want to make sure your savings outweigh any lender or title transfer fees. Since the Fed\u2019s rate decrease is expected to be 50 basis points or less, waiting to refinance after additional rate cuts could be more beneficial.", "full_prompt": "[question]\n Explain the potential effects of the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate cuts on personal finance, particularly focusing on credit card debt, mortgages, and auto loans. How should individuals prepare for these changes?\n \n\n =====================\n \n\n [text]\n Reference Text:\n Inflation has slowed and the labor market has softened enough to satisfy the Federal Reserve. That means the central bank is about to cut interest rates.\n \n\n On Aug. 23, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said, \u201cThe time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.\u201d In other words, Americans should prepare to finally catch a break when it comes to borrowing to pay for a home, buy a car or open a new credit card. There are also other implications for the health of the broader economy.\n \n\n Back in March 2022, the Federal Open Markets Committee (FOMC) began to increase the federal funds rate in response to growing inflation. It hiked rates 11 times before finally pausing. The rates, set at 5.25% to 5.50%, haven\u2019t budged since July 2023.\n \n\n The first cut will almost certainly happen at the Fed\u2019s upcoming meeting scheduled for Sept. 17-18. The futures market\u2019s CME FedWatch Tool now predicts a 87% likelihood that the FOMC will cut the current target rate by 25 basis points; it predicts a 13% likelihood of a larger cut of 50 basis points.\n \n\n But even if the Fed trims rates next week as expected, the target will still be a long way from the near-zero rate of early 2020 and immediate effects will be muted. Mortgage rates have already been easing in anticipation of a cut, for example, and most consumer credit and lending products are more dependent on your credit score than on the Fed rate. Still, this is viewed as a significant event and could build expectations for more cuts down the road.\n \n\n So what happens next? NerdWallet writers teamed up to explain how upcoming Fed rate cuts could impact your personal finances and what you can do to prepare. Credit card interest rates are variable, meaning they adjust up or down shortly after the Fed changes the federal funds rate. So if the Fed lowers interest rates, credit card debt will cost slightly less.\n \n\n The operative word here is \u201cslightly.\u201d Credit card debt is expensive no matter what the federal funds rate happens to be. Let\u2019s say you have an average balance of $5,000 on a card charging 25% APR. You\u2019ll spend around $1,250 in interest over the course of a year. If your interest rate was 24% instead, that\u2019s just $50 less in interest for the year. Point being, a rate reduction doesn\u2019t translate to a massive savings in interest when it comes to credit cards.\n \n\n Still, you can use the upcoming Fed news as a reminder to check in on your debt and make a plan to pay it down as aggressively as you can. If you qualify, a balance transfer credit card could give you a year or more without interest. Lower interest rates might make a personal loan a compelling debt consolidation option. Mortgage interest rates have already headed lower ahead of any action by the Fed. In April, the average interest rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate loan was 7.04%. August's average was nearly three-quarters of a percentage point lower, at 6.31%. That 73-basis-point drop is larger than any anticipated rate cut, but rates may push even lower once the central bankers start chopping.\n \n\n Homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages or home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) should see savings right away as their interest rates ratchet downward. But lower mortgage interest rates might also be a boon to homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages. Those who bought when rates were higher could finally see a significant benefit from refinancing, while owners who feel tethered by their current low mortgage rates may feel more confident about making a move. Reducing that rate \"lock in\" effect could put more homes on the market, particularly at the starter-home level. Prospective home buyers likely feel heartened by the prospect of rate cuts, but a quarter or even half of a percentage point cut from the Federal Reserve shouldn't cause a sudden drop in mortgage rates, especially with a downward trend already in progress. So, don't wait on the Fed: Buy when you're ready, not when interest rates are. While you're preparing to buy \u2014 and during your home search \u2014 work on your finances. Continue to pay down high-interest debt, try to build your credit score, don't take out new loans and keep making on-time payments. That way, when you're applying for a mortgage, you'll be in a strong position to get a lender's best possible interest rate regardless of where prevailing rates are. Auto loan interest rates typically follow the path of the Fed rate, but it can take time to see. When car loan rates do begin to fall, will it be a good time to buy or refinance? Here are some considerations to help you decide.\n \n\n Your APR on a car loan is determined by many factors, such as your credit history, credit score, loan term and vehicle age.

Summarize this article on bronchitis for me and format your response in bullet form.", "context_document": "Cough is the most common illness-related reason for ambulatory care visits in the United States. Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis characterized by cough due to acute inflammation of the trachea and large airways without evidence of pneumonia. Pneumonia should be suspected in patients with tachypnea, tachycardia, dyspnea, or lung findings suggestive of pneumonia, and radiography is warranted. Pertussis should be suspected in patients with cough persisting for more than two weeks that is accompanied by symptoms such as paroxysmal cough, whooping cough, and post-tussive emesis, or recent pertussis exposure. The cough associated with acute bronchitis typically lasts about two to three weeks, and this should be emphasized with patients. Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses, and antibiotics are not indicated in patients without chronic lung disease. Antibiotics have been shown to provide only minimal benefit, reducing the cough or illness by about half a day, and have adverse effects, including allergic reactions, nausea and vomiting, and Clostridium difficile infection. Evaluation and treatment of bronchitis include ruling out secondary causes for cough, such as pneumonia; educating patients about the natural course of the disease; and recommending symptomatic treatment and avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic use.

Acute bronchitis is a clinical diagnosis characterized by cough due to acute inflammation of the trachea and large airways without evidence of pneumonia. Pneumonia should be suspected in patients with tachypnea, tachycardia, dyspnea, or lung findings suggestive of pneumonia, and radiography is warranted. Pertussis should be suspected in patients with cough persisting for more than two weeks that is accompanied by symptoms such as paroxysmal cough, whooping cough, and post-tussive emesis, or recent pertussis exposure. The cough associated with acute bronchitis typically lasts about two to three weeks, and this should be emphasized with patients. Acute bronchitis is usually caused by viruses, and antibiotics are not indicated in patients without chronic lung disease. Antibiotics have been shown to provide only minimal benefit, reducing the cough or illness by about half a day, and have adverse effects, including allergic reactions, nausea and vomiting, and Clostridium difficile infection. Evaluation and treatment of bronchitis include ruling out secondary causes for cough, such as pneumonia; educating patients about the natural course of the disease; and recommending symptomatic treatment and avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic use.

(For Photography)\n \n\n Having more megapixels on your digital camera or smartphone can be useful.\n \n\n However, do megapixels matter when it comes to overall image quality?\n \n\n Photographers love to discuss the merits of more camera megapixels in digital photography.\n \n\n In this guide, I\u2019ll explain why having more megapixels isn\u2019t always necessary\u2026 nor a good thing.\n \n\n You\u2019ll also discover which digital cameras and smartphones have the highest pixel count in 2024.\n \n\n What Do MegaPixels Mean on a Camera?\n \n\n The megapixels on a camera refer to the pixel count present in the sensor. For example, if you have a 24 MP camera, it means that the final image will have 24 million pixels.\n \n\n The total pixel count is what\u2019s known as the camera resolution. You can calculate the resolution by multiplying the number of pixels on the horizontal side of the sensor by the ones on the vertical side.\n \n\n If the camera sensor has a 2:3 aspect ratio \u2013 this means that the 24 megapixels are distributed as 6000 on one side and 4000 in the other.\n How many megapixels can the human eye see?\n \n\n Well, the human eye doesn\u2019t actually have pixels. So, comparing the human eye to a camera\u2019s sensor is not like comparing the resolution of two cameras. What we know is an estimate calculated by photographer and scientist Dr. Roger N. Clark.\n \n\n Using very complex math, he determined that the human eye \u2018resolution\u2019 is 576 megapixels. You can learn more about how he reached this result on his website \u2013 Clarkvision.\n \n\n However, according to an article published by Lasik \u2013 576 MP is the resolution reached when moving. Instead, on a single glance, the human eye has a 5 to 15 MP \u2018resolution\u2019.\n \n\n Are There Any Drawbacks to Having Too Many Megapixels?\n \n\n The first drawback of having more megapixels is that you\u2019ll have bigger files. This means that you\u2019ll fill the memory card faster and you\u2019ll need more storage space either on your hard drive or a cloud service to back them up.\n \n\n This is a fair compromise when you actually need high-resolution images. However, if you have large files because they have more megapixels than you need, then it\u2019s not worth it.\n \n\n Another potential drawback is the slower processing time. This may affect you when shooting, transferring, and editing the files.\n \n\n Large files in-camera take longer to be saved in the memory card. If you shoot in burst mode \u2013 for example, it could diminish the fps.\n \n\n It could also mean slowing the processing to transfer, cull, and edit your photos \u2013 this also depends on how powerful is your computer.\n \n\n Also, when the camera sensors aren\u2019t big enough for the amount of pixels, you\u2019ll have a bigger image resolution but not higher image quality.

The more megapixels you have, the bigger you can print your image.\n \n\n Another situation in which more megapixels are beneficial is when you need to crop your image.\n \n\n This is because even if you lose megapixels by cutting out part of your photo \u2013 the file still has enough resolution to print or zoom on your screen.\n \n\n  How to Choose Photo Resolution & Size for Printing Or Online Use\n \n\n How Many Megapixels Do Photographers Actually Need?\n \n\n If you\u2019re wondering how many megapixels you need to print high-resolution images, you need to multiply the print size by 300 \u2013 which is the standard dpi for photographic printing.\n \n\n So, if you need to print an 8\u2033 x 10\u2033 photo, it needs to have 2,400 x 3,000 pixels. To print a 16\u2033 x 24\u2033 you need a file with 4,800 x 7,200 pixels and so on.\n How many megapixels do professional photographers use?\n \n\n Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t a straight answer to this. The megapixels required by a professional photographer depend on the type of photos they do and how the images are going to be used.\n \n\n To give an approximate number, most professional DSLR and mirrorless cameras have a resolution between 24 and 36 MP. However, some professionals use medium-format digital cameras that range from 50 to 100 MP.\n How many megapixels do you need for wedding photography?\n \n\n Most professional wedding photographers can make do with a resolution ranging from 20 to 24 MP. However, depending on the prints and wedding albums you plan to deliver (and also how much you usually crop your photos), having higher-resolution cameras can be an advantage.\n Does the megapixel count change if you shoot in RAW or JPG?\n \n\n The number of megapixels on the RAW and JPG files may be different depending on the camera settings.\n \n\n Most cameras allow you to choose the size of the RAW and JPG files they save. For example, I can set a Canon 90D to shoot in C-RAW and save a raw file of 32MP (6960 x 4640) and a small file JPG file of 3.8MP (2400 x 1600).\n \n\n Each camera will have different sizes available for each file type \u2013 you\u2019ll need to check yours on the user\u2019s manual or by doing a quick Google search.\n \n\n What About Megapixels and Smartphone Photography?\n \n\n  \n \n\n You\u2019ve probably seen smartphones that advertise enough megapixels to beat any DSLR or mirrorless cameras on the market.\n \n\n This may lead you to wonder why isn\u2019t professional photographers don\u2019t use smartphones to take photos for their jobs.\n \n\n Well, camera lenses, the ability to sync with flashes, and many other features make this impossible.\n \n\n However, it\u2019s not just that, it\u2019s also because of how smartphones get to that pixel count and what that means in resolution and quality.\n \n\n Due to their size, it\u2019s impossible for them to actually fit such a larger sensor inside the device.

Data on safety and efficacy have been limited to small, phase 1 or phase 2 trials.\n Methods\n We conducted a 52-week, phase 3, parallel-design, open-label, treat-to-target trial involving adults with type 2 diabetes who had not previously received insulin. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive efsitora or degludec. The primary end point was the change in the glycated hemoglobin level from baseline to week 52; we hypothesized that efsitora would be noninferior to degludec (noninferiority margin, 0.4 percentage points). Secondary and safety end points included the change in the glycated hemoglobin level in subgroups of participants using and not using glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, the percentage of time that the glucose level was in the target range of 70 to 180 mg per deciliter in weeks 48 through 52, and hypoglycemic episodes.\n Results\n A total of 928 participants underwent randomization (466 to the efsitora group and 462 to the degludec group). The mean glycated hemoglobin level decreased from 8.21% at baseline to 6.97% at week 52 with efsitora (least-squares mean change, -1.26 percentage points) and from 8.24% to 7.05% with degludec (least-squares mean change, -1.17 percentage points) (estimated treatment difference, -0.09 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.22 to 0.04), findings that showed noninferiority. Efsitora was noninferior to degludec with respect to the change in the glycated hemoglobin level in participants using and not using GLP-1 receptor agonists. The percentage of time that the glucose level was within the target range was 64.3% with efsitora and 61.2% with degludec (estimated treatment difference, 3.1 percentage points; 95% CI, 0.1 to 6.1). The rate of combined clinically significant or severe hypoglycemia was 0.58 events per participant-year of exposure with efsitora and 0.45 events per participant-year of exposure with degludec (estimated rate ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.78). No severe hypoglycemia was reported with efsitora; six episodes were reported with degludec. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups.\n Conclusions\n In adults with type 2 diabetes who had not previously received insulin, once-weekly efsitora was noninferior to once-daily degludec in reducing glycated hemoglobin levels.

On January 31, 2012, a federal multidistrict litigation was\n established in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, In re: National Football League Players\u2019 Concussion Injury Litigation, MDL No. 2323. Plaintiffs in MDL No. 2323 filed a Master Administrative Long-Form Complaint and a\n Master Administrative Class Action Complaint for Medical Monitoring on June 7, 2012. Plaintiffs filed an Amended Master Administrative Long-Form Complaint on July 17, 2012. Additional similar lawsuits are pending in various state and federal courts.\n \n\n B. The lawsuits arise from the alleged effects of mild traumatic brain\n injury allegedly caused by the concussive and sub-concussive impacts experienced by former NFL Football players. Plaintiffs seek to hold the NFL Parties responsible for their alleged injuries under various theories of liability, including that the NFL Parties allegedly breached a duty to NFL Football players to warn and protect them from the long-term health problems associated with concussions and that the NFL Parties allegedly concealed and misrepresented the connection between concussions and long term chronic brain injury.\n \n\n C. On August 30, 2012, the NFL Parties filed motions to dismiss the\n Master Administrative Class Action Complaint for Medical Monitoring and the Amended Master Administrative Long-Form Complaint on preemption grounds. Plaintiffs filed their oppositions to the motions on October 31, 2012, the NFL Parties filed reply\n memoranda of law on December 17, 2012, and plaintiffs filed sur reply memoranda of law on January 28, 2013. Oral argument on the NFL Parties\u2019 motions to dismiss on preemption grounds was held on April 9, 2013.\n \n\n D. On July 8, 2013, prior to ruling on the motions to dismiss, the\n Court ordered the plaintiffs and NFL Parties to engage in mediation to determine if consensual resolution was possible and appointed retired United States District Court Judge Layn Phillips of Irell & Manella LLP as mediator.\n \n\n E. Over the course of the following two months, the Parties, by and\n through their respective counsel, engaged in settlement negotiations under the direction of Judge Phillips. On August 29, 2013, the Parties signed a settlement term sheet setting\n forth the material terms of a settlement agreement. On the same day, the Court issued an order deferring a ruling on the NFL Parties\u2019 motions to dismiss and ordering the Parties to submit, as soon as possible, the full documentation relating to the settlement, along\n with a motion seeking preliminary approval of the settlement and notice plan. On December 16, 2013, the Court appointed a special master, Perry Golkin (\u201cSpecial Master Golkin\u201d), to assist the Court in evaluating the financial aspects of the proposed\n settlement.\n \n\n F. On January 6, 2014, Class Counsel moved the Court for an order,\n among other things, granting preliminary approval of the proposed settlement and conditionally certifying a settlement class and subclasses.

In the Class Action Complaint, the Class and Subclass Representatives\n allege claims for equitable, injunctive and declaratory relief pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(a)(1-4) & (b)(2), or, alternatively, for compensatory damages pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), for negligence, negligent hiring,\n negligent retention, negligent misrepresentation, fraud, fraudulent concealment, medical monitoring, wrongful death and survival, and loss of consortium, all under state law.\n \n\n H.

Please list and give detailed descriptions of the steps needed to do this. Also include a list of equipment I'll need.", "context_document": "Digitizing Glass Plate Photography\n Digitization refers to the process of creating digital images of physical items, yet this process requires many steps. And while the equipment needed for digitizing glass photographs exists in a variety of price points, the basic tenets remain the same: imaging, editing, describing (with metadata), archiving, and sharing.\n Imaging\n To image glass photographs, it is necessary to have a camera and a light source, as glass photographs must be backlit to render the images visible. Best practices recommend a flat lightboard for consistent illumination, a camera copy stand, and a camera with focus peaking and aperture priority to achieve the highest quality images. For the lightboard, also known as a light table, it is recommended to use one with a coloring rendering index of 90+ and 5000-5500k light temperature. Cameras should be mounted to the copy stand with overhead mounts to ensure consistent imaging; best practice is to use a level to ensure the camera and light table are parallel to each other.\n Editing\n While editing images for commercial or marketing practices is acceptable, editing photographs of physical items for archival purposes is typically not recommended. To edit the images for archival purposes, it is best practice to make only minimal adjustments, such as converting negatives to positives. For copies of the digitized images to be used for marketing purposes, etc., it is acceptable to edit the contrast, exposure, brightness, etc. or to touchup breaks in the glass or emulsion. It is also acceptable at this phase to add watermarks or logos to copies of the digitized images, however this should again only be done with non-archival copies of the images.\n Description\u2014Metadata\n The metadata for glass photographs may come in the form of supplemental materials; institutional, personal, or expert knowledge; or may even be on the plates themselves, written onto the paper edgings or directly on the glass. Metadata from this information can be created for the entire collection, specific boxes or containers, individual images, or a combination thereof. This information not only helps users in the search and discovery phases of seeking digitized images, but it also helps organize and adds context and provenance to digital images.\n Workflows for adding metadata vary. Some prefer to work with the metadata after the glass photographs are imaged, while others prefer to have the metadata completely organized before imaging. The timing of metadata inclusion must be made by considering the conditions of the glass photographs and their storage facilities, the level of metadata available, and the availability of staff dedicated to the process. The best way to add metadata to digitized images is to use a program that embeds metadata within the image. This guarantees that the metadata is always connected to the image and can be extracted from the EXIF data. Adobe Lightroom and similar programs can perform this function. In addition, it is also helpful to keep local files, software, or databases that detail the metadata associated with the images in the glass photographs.\n Storage\u2014Digital Archives\n To archive the digitized images, it is important to follow the 3-2-1 digital preservation standard by saving three copies of every digital image, in two different file formats, with one copy saved in a different location. RAW or TIFF file types are best for long-term storage because they are less prone to bit-rot and therefore less likely to degrade over time. Uncompressed TIFF files are typically quite large, which allows for printing at considerable scale without pixelating, however they also take up much more storage space. These file formats are typically best saved in rarely used storage locations, as their size slows down most computing processes, and the full-size uncompressed images are not frequently needed for everyday use. In practice, the authors have found it best to take the initial images of the glass plates in RAW format, and then save additional copies in compressed file formats. Commonly used compressed file formats include JPEG and PNG. These files are smaller and load faster on websites and computers, which allows for easier shared use.\n Sharing\n Finally, it is important to share digitized images of glass photographs, both to educate others on the unique existence of these items while also limiting contact and handling. For the authors, sharing digitized images and the standards for doing so are the key additions to the updated literature on best practices for glass photographs. Much of the previous literature was written at least a decade ago, and much has changed in the information and communication technology landscape in that time.\n For glass photograph imaging projects, it is necessary to create multiple points of access to the visual and historical information obtained from these glass plates. Publishing collection information in multimedia form creates a rich resource for researchers and specialists. Images accompanying textual records enhance the collections for audiences of different ages and interests across the world and create a basic resource for interpretative applications to be built on. Work in digital humanities, digital archives, and museum informatics can attest to the audience for and varied applications of these materials.\n Through the digitization of cultural collections, these resources can be used for multiple purposes, including educational and interpretive research. Digitized collections allow viewers to zoom in and examine details of glass photographs which would not otherwise be seen in a display case or by the naked eye. For cultural institutions, digitization offers the ability to display an entire collection, as large parts of it would not typically be on public display, and to reach those who cannot visit in person. Other benefits include the ability to adjust interpretative applications for users with disabilities or special needs.\n While social media sites are a natural place to promote such images, they should be used as a secondary location. Best practices recommend a primary location for all images to be shared with the public, such as a website, digital asset management system (DAMS), database with a strong graphical user interface (GUI), or dedicated photo storage site such as Flickr.

In the course of carrying out their duties, federal law enforcement agencies may use FRT for a variety of purposes. For instance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) uses the technology to aid its investigations, and the bureau provides facial recognition assistance to federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement partners. State, local, and tribal law enforcement have also adopted facial recognition software systems to assist in various phases of investigations. In addition, border officials use facial recognition for identity verification purposes. The use of FRT by law enforcement agencies has spurred questions on a range of topics. Some primary concerns revolve around the accuracy of the technology, including potential race-, gender-, and age-related biases; the collection, retention, and security of images contained in various facial recognition databases; public notification regarding the use of facial recognition and other image capturing technology; and policies or standards governing law enforcement agencies\u2019 use of the technology. Some of these concerns have manifested in actions such as federal, state, and city efforts to prohibit or bound law enforcement agencies\u2019 use of FRT. In addition, some companies producing facial recognition software, such as Microsoft, IBM, and Amazon, have enacted new barriers to law enforcement using their technologies. This report provides an overview of federal law enforcement agencies\u2019 use of FRT, including the current status of scientific standards for its use. The report includes a discussion of how FRT may be used by law enforcement agencies with traditional policing missions as well as by those charged with securing the U.S. borders. It also discusses considerations for policymakers debating whether or how to influence federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies\u2019 use of FRT. \nThe term facial recognition technology can have different meanings for law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and the public, and the process of using facial recognition in a law enforcement context can involve various technologies and actors. Broadly, as technology experts have noted, \u201c[t]here is no one standard system design for facial recognition systems. Not only do organizations build their systems differently, and for different environments, but they also use different terms to describe how their systems work.\u201d 3 The following key terms are provided to help in understanding facial recognition technologies and processes in this report. 4 Face detection technology determines whether a digital image contains a face. Facial classification algorithms analyze a face image to produce an estimate of age, sex, or some other property, but do not identify the individual. An example application of this would be retail stores using facial classification to gather data on the gender and age ranges of people visiting a store, without identifying each shopper individually. Facial comparison and facial identification are often used in the same context. They involve a human manually examining the differences and similarities between facial images, or between a live subject and facial images, for the purpose of determining if they represent the same person. Facial comparison has three broad categories: assessment, review, and examination. Facial assessment is a quick image-to-image or image-to-person comparison, typically carried out in screening or access control situations, and is the least rigorous form of facial comparison. Facial review (often used in investigative, operational, or intelligence gathering applications) and facial examination (often used in a forensic applications) are increasingly rigorous levels of image comparison and should involve verification by an additional reviewer or examiner. They may involve a formal, systematic examination of facial images.\nFacial recognition broadly involves the automated searching of a facial image (a probe) against a known collection or database of photos. Facial recognition algorithms compare identity information from facial features in two face image samples and produce a measure of similarity (sometimes called a match score) between them; this information can be used to determine whether the same person is in both images. Images that have a similarity score above a defined threshold are presented to the user. There are two ways in which facial recognition algorithms work to compare images: \u2022 One-to-one verification algorithms compare a photo of someone claiming a specific identity with a stored image(s) of that known identity to determine if it is the same person. Uses of these algorithms can include unlocking a smartphone and verifying identities at a security checkpoint. \u2022 One-to-many identification search algorithms compare features of a probe photo with all those in a gallery of images. The algorithms can provide either a fixed number of the most similar candidates, or all candidates with a similarity score above a preset threshold, for human review. These algorithms may be used for purposes such as identifying potential suspect leads from a mugshot database. Probe refers to the facial image or template searched against a gallery or database of photos in a facial recognition system. Real-time facial recognition involves facial recognition algorithms that can be used while a video recording is taking place in order to determine in real time whether an individual in a video matches with a list of candidates in a database of photos. Threshold refers to any real number against which similarity scores are compared to produce a verification decision or gallery of images.\nLaw enforcement agencies\u2019 use of FRT has received attention from policymakers and the public over the past several years. There have been heightened concerns following several revelations, including that Clearview AI, a company that developed image-search technology used by law enforcement agencies around the country, had amassed a database of over 3 billion images against which probe photos could be compared. FRT is one of several biometric technologies employed by law enforcement agencies, which also include fingerprint, palm print, DNA and iris scans. FRT can be used by law enforcement for a variety of purposes such as generating investigative leads, identifying victims of crimes, facilitating the examination of forensic evidence, and helping verify the identity of individuals being released from prison. Press releases and statements from the Department of Justice highlight how the technology has been used in the criminal justice system. FRT has been used to help generate suspect leads. In one case, FBI agents used the technology, via the Mississippi Fusion Center, to identify a potential suspect in an interstate stalking case who had allegedly been harassing high school girls through their Twitter accounts.The suspect was later sentenced to 46 months imprisonment and three years of supervised release for this stalking.FRT may also be used to help identify victims. For example, officials have noted FRT was used to help identify \u201can accident victim lying unconscious on the side of the road.\u201dFRT, along with other pieces of evidence, has been used to support probable cause in affidavits in support of criminal complaints. In one case, an FBI agent cited the use of FRT in a criminal complaint against a bank robbery suspect. The agent noted that images from the bank\u2019s surveillance footage were run against facial recognition software, and a photo of the suspect was returned as a possible match. Investigators then interviewed associates of the suspect, who identified him as the man in the bank surveillance footage.\nNotably, the frequency and extent to which FRT is used at various phases of the criminal justice system (from generating leads and helping establish probable cause for an arrest or indictment, to serving as evidence in courtrooms) is unknown. It is most often discussed as being employed during investigations by law enforcement officials. Of note, FRT is generally used by law enforcement in one-to-many searches to produce a gallery of potential suspects ranked by similarity and not to provide a single affirmative match. As such, the technology currently might not be relied upon in the same way that other biometric evidence might. Rather, it is the results of an investigator\u2019s facial review between a probe face and the gallery of images produced from running a probe face through facial recognition software that might be used as evidence contributing to an arrest and prosecution. \n", "full_prompt": "What risks or concerns have been identified regarding the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement agencies?\n\nAnswer the question using only the information provided below.

The report includes a discussion of how FRT may be used by law enforcement agencies with traditional policing missions as well as by those charged with securing the U.S. borders. It also discusses considerations for policymakers debating whether or how to influence federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies\u2019 use of FRT. \nThe term facial recognition technology can have different meanings for law enforcement agencies, policymakers, and the public, and the process of using facial recognition in a law enforcement context can involve various technologies and actors. Broadly, as technology experts have noted, \u201c[t]here is no one standard system design for facial recognition systems. Not only do organizations build their systems differently, and for different environments, but they also use different terms to describe how their systems work.\u201d 3 The following key terms are provided to help in understanding facial recognition technologies and processes in this report. 4 Face detection technology determines whether a digital image contains a face. Facial classification algorithms analyze a face image to produce an estimate of age, sex, or some other property, but do not identify the individual. An example application of this would be retail stores using facial classification to gather data on the gender and age ranges of people visiting a store, without identifying each shopper individually. Facial comparison and facial identification are often used in the same context. They involve a human manually examining the differences and similarities between facial images, or between a live subject and facial images, for the purpose of determining if they represent the same person. Facial comparison has three broad categories: assessment, review, and examination. Facial assessment is a quick image-to-image or image-to-person comparison, typically carried out in screening or access control situations, and is the least rigorous form of facial comparison. Facial review (often used in investigative, operational, or intelligence gathering applications) and facial examination (often used in a forensic applications) are increasingly rigorous levels of image comparison and should involve verification by an additional reviewer or examiner. They may involve a formal, systematic examination of facial images.\nFacial recognition broadly involves the automated searching of a facial image (a probe) against a known collection or database of photos. Facial recognition algorithms compare identity information from facial features in two face image samples and produce a measure of similarity (sometimes called a match score) between them; this information can be used to determine whether the same person is in both images. Images that have a similarity score above a defined threshold are presented to the user. There are two ways in which facial recognition algorithms work to compare images: \u2022 One-to-one verification algorithms compare a photo of someone claiming a specific identity with a stored image(s) of that known identity to determine if it is the same person. Uses of these algorithms can include unlocking a smartphone and verifying identities at a security checkpoint. \u2022 One-to-many identification search algorithms compare features of a probe photo with all those in a gallery of images. The algorithms can provide either a fixed number of the most similar candidates, or all candidates with a similarity score above a preset threshold, for human review. These algorithms may be used for purposes such as identifying potential suspect leads from a mugshot database. Probe refers to the facial image or template searched against a gallery or database of photos in a facial recognition system. Real-time facial recognition involves facial recognition algorithms that can be used while a video recording is taking place in order to determine in real time whether an individual in a video matches with a list of candidates in a database of photos. Threshold refers to any real number against which similarity scores are compared to produce a verification decision or gallery of images.\nLaw enforcement agencies\u2019 use of FRT has received attention from policymakers and the public over the past several years. There have been heightened concerns following several revelations, including that Clearview AI, a company that developed image-search technology used by law enforcement agencies around the country, had amassed a database of over 3 billion images against which probe photos could be compared. FRT is one of several biometric technologies employed by law enforcement agencies, which also include fingerprint, palm print, DNA and iris scans. FRT can be used by law enforcement for a variety of purposes such as generating investigative leads, identifying victims of crimes, facilitating the examination of forensic evidence, and helping verify the identity of individuals being released from prison. Press releases and statements from the Department of Justice highlight how the technology has been used in the criminal justice system. FRT has been used to help generate suspect leads. In one case, FBI agents used the technology, via the Mississippi Fusion Center, to identify a potential suspect in an interstate stalking case who had allegedly been harassing high school girls through their Twitter accounts.The suspect was later sentenced to 46 months imprisonment and three years of supervised release for this stalking.FRT may also be used to help identify victims. For example, officials have noted FRT was used to help identify \u201can accident victim lying unconscious on the side of the road.\u201dFRT, along with other pieces of evidence, has been used to support probable cause in affidavits in support of criminal complaints. In one case, an FBI agent cited the use of FRT in a criminal complaint against a bank robbery suspect. The agent noted that images from the bank\u2019s surveillance footage were run against facial recognition software, and a photo of the suspect was returned as a possible match. Investigators then interviewed associates of the suspect, who identified him as the man in the bank surveillance footage.\nNotably, the frequency and extent to which FRT is used at various phases of the criminal justice system (from generating leads and helping establish probable cause for an arrest or indictment, to serving as evidence in courtrooms) is unknown. It is most often discussed as being employed during investigations by law enforcement officials. Of note, FRT is generally used by law enforcement in one-to-many searches to produce a gallery of potential suspects ranked by similarity and not to provide a single affirmative match. As such, the technology currently might not be relied upon in the same way that other biometric evidence might. Rather, it is the results of an investigator\u2019s facial review between a probe face and the gallery of images produced from running a probe face through facial recognition software that might be used as evidence contributing to an arrest and prosecution.

However, NSAIDs should be prescribed with caution as courses of just a few days, even at\r\ndoses within prescribing recommendations, can be associated with serious adverse effects in susceptible\r\npatients. In primary care, paracetamol is recommended in preference to NSAIDs, where appropriate. If a\r\npatient is likely to benefit from NSAID treatment naproxen or ibuprofen are recommended first-line, at the\r\nlowest effective dose, for the shortest possible time. Patients taking NSAIDs who are at increased risk of\r\ncomplications require regular monitoring.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow NSAIDs work determines their risk and                            How NSAIDs work, the patient\u2019s age and the condition being\r\nguides their use                                                     treated also need to be taken into account when these issues\r\n                                                                     are discussed with patients.\r\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the\r\nmost frequently prescribed medicines for analgesia in\r\nprimary care, after paracetamol.1 However, NSAID use can be          NSAIDs and cyclo-oxygenase (COX) selectivity\r\nassociated with a range of serious adverse effects including:        The cyclo-oxygenase-1 (COX-1) and COX-2 enzymes produce\r\ncardiovascular events, gastrointestinal complications, renal         prostaglandins following the metabolism of omega-6\r\nfailure and hypersensitivity reactions.

You can also talk to industry professionals to learn their daily activities and necessary skills to determine if these aspects inspire you to seek a specific position.\n\nTake advantage of online courses:\nThere are programs online that can help you learn valuable skills that can help you excel in the tech industry, like programming, coding or software development. These self-paced programs allow you to learn at your own pace and develop skills without committing to a single program or course, and many provide certifications that can help differentiate you from other candidates in the application process. Even if you don't possess industry experience, online courses can provide a valuable advantage by developing the essential skills that many tech jobs require.\n\nIdentify your outsider advantage:\nBecause the tech industry is constantly changing, many tech companies advertise nontechnical positions from human resources, product marketing or sales development to gain employees with different viewpoints. Candidates without technical experience can provide unique perspectives on how they communicate with technology. Hiring managers often seek candidates with adept communication skills and the ability to relate strongly to others to promote a collaborative work environment and increase project efficiency, so consider including these skills on your resume while applying for jobs.\n\nResearch tech startup companies:\nStartup companies often forego traditional job requirements to focus more on training and candidate potential, and they usually seek qualified individuals with marketable skills and excellent communication abilities. With these skills and some technical experience, you can be an ideal candidate for many tech startup companies. Consider accepting an internship or finding a mentor so you can apply your technical skills, gain industry experience and become an appealing candidate to startup hiring managers.\n\nFocus on your unique qualities:\nWhen you apply for a job in the tech industry, you can differentiate yourself from other candidates by identifying which skills make you unique. Explaining nontechnical qualities like drive, determination and perseverance can enhance your resume and help you appeal to potential employers. You can also include general soft skills like problem solving, adaptability and quick learning to show hiring managers you're skillful in several areas that can benefit their company."}

There are currently AI tools where the objectives are not clear, making them usable in a vast array of contexts, but also susceptible to manipulation or use in detrimental ways. For example, while Large Language Models (LLMs) are optimized for the narrow task of text prediction, they do not have a single objective in their main end-to-end applications; thus, they can be utilized in content generation for marketing purposes, in translation, and to produce misinformation at scale. In other cases, the objective is known and the AI system is optimized for that objective but the outcome can result in unintended harm. For instance, while some AI systems might aim for higher clicks, they might inadvertently contribute to societal polarization. This is an example of unintended consequence of an AI tool optimized on a known objective. As AI has evolved, especially with the development of Foundation models, numerous strategies have been proposed to integrate safety precautions and protective guardrails during deployment. However, there is substantial evidence indicating that malicious entities can bypass these barriers, leading the Foundation models to breach the safety protocols that were put in place. As such, there is a continued need for research into these safety challenges. Malicious objectives: It is important to protect against the misuse of AI. This is true for both proprietary and open-source AI. Ensuring public access to technology through open-source supports efforts to democratize AI development. However, these open-source models can be utilized by bad actors for malicious objectives such as phishing and scamming. Similarly, close-source models also can pose similar risks if they are misused by bad actors. Circumvention of safety measures: As AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, there is a heightened risk that they may devise means to bypass the very protocols put in place to oversee or limit their actions. This is particularly worrisome because, while humans design these safety measures with specific intentions, an AI might interpret them differently or identify loopholes. As the wave of AI and automation continues its transformative journey across industries, it will have a disruptive impact on employment opportunities. This impact could make jobs better and more accessible to a broader proportion of the population, but also has the potential to increase inequality. On one hand, sectors reliant on routine tasks are confronted with potential impacts on jobs, while on the other hand, the rise of AI-driven enterprises might inadvertently magnify the chasm of economic inequality. However, it should be noted that these studies discuss exposure to AI. Exposure does not necessarily translate to loss of jobs as the market could expand. It is apparent that some jobs will be lost and others will be created, and in some instances lower-performing workers will be boosted by AI, supplementing their capabilities. The concern is that without proactively developing the ability to detect and address changes and disruptions, and without awareness of labor market trends, available educational upskilling programs, and policies such as wage insurance for workers preparing for new roles (especially in the rapidly changing environment), it is possible to witness stark increases in inequality even as productivity rises. But the challenges are not solely economic. Ethical and societal dilemmas are emerging at the forefront, with growing concerns about individual privacy, copyright infringement, and the increasing human dependence on these technologies. Content authenticity verification presents a significant challenge, heightening worries about deepfakes and misinformation, which could undermine democratic processes. As AI systems grow more powerful and potentially gain more sophisticated capabilities, concerns have been raised about the possibility that these technologies will cause significant disruptions. These can manifest in the form of threats to democracy, like meddling in the electoral process, national security threats such as bioweapons or cyberattacks, and societal disruptions via polarizing AI systems used in platforms like social media. It should be noted that there are differing opinions on the feasibility of superhuman capabilities of AI and whether the risks can be categorized as large-scale disruption and catastrophic. In addition, many of these risks are instances of AI used for malicious objectives, unintended consequences of AI systems, or economic and societal risks as mentioned in previous parts taken to their extreme. These risks include: Uncontrolled growth: As AI acquires more sophisticated capabilities, some have raised concerns that it could act unpredictably, making decisions or taking actions not fully understood by its developers. Destabilization of democracy: The improper and malevolent use of AI has the potential to critically destabilize democratic systems. For example, if AI is harnessed to meddle with electoral processes, this could undermine confidence in democratic processes. One of the most prominent concerns is the spread of misinformation and disinformation. Moreover, AI tools can also be employed for more direct manipulation of voter behavior. National security threats: Malicious inputs have the capacity to trick AI systems, leading to operational failures. Furthermore, when AI is integrated into realms like warfare, cyber-attacks, and bioweapons, it can both intensify conflicts and usher in unpredictable combat tactics.  Manipulation and polarization: AI, such as those used in social media platforms, can manipulate information to increase user engagement, inadvertently leading to societal polarization and misinformation. As AI's potential grows, so do the complexities and concerns surrounding its assimilation into diverse societal sectors. Nonetheless, every hurdle also presents a chance to evolve and refine. This is especially true in the AI domain. Delving into potential resolutions and protective measures isn't merely scholarly; it's imperative to ensure AI is utilized ethically, responsibly, and safely for everyone's advantage in the future. It's essential to enforce transparency, ensuring users recognize when they are engaging with an AI rather than a human, especially in scenarios where trust and authenticity are paramount.  Below are some of the mitigation strategies suggested by the experts. Adaptive regulation: There has been emphasis on the importance of regulating AI in a manner that's both agile and adaptive. Given that AI can evolve faster than legislative systems, regulations need to be flexible enough to address current and future risks. Regulations should also be designed based on input from multiple stakeholders: corporations, advocacy groups, academic leaders. It has been further suggested that risk should be associated with AI's uses, not the technology itself. Lastly, in light of the recent declaration about voluntary commitments, it has been suggested to make some of these commitments obligatory. Other possible suggestions include and possibly encompass third-party verification, registration, and licensing of certain AI systems.  Research investment: It is paramount to invest in AI research. It has been suggested that the research should be segmented into public and classified. The public research involves conventional academic research that openly publishes findings on AI risk safety solutions. This research can further delve into the appropriate governance and regulation necessary to ensure public safety, providing valuable insights for policymakers aiming to regulate AI effectively. The classified research pertains to concentrating on counteractions against malevolent users of AI or inadvertent AI control losses with national security consequences.

A cell is chemical system that is able to maintain its structure\r\nand reproduce. Cells are the fundamental unit of life. All living things are cells or composed of\r\ncells. Although different living things may be as unlike as a violet and an octopus, they are all built\r\nin essentially the same way. The most basic similarity is that all living things are composed of one\r\nor more cells. This is known as the Cell Theory.\r\nOur knowledge of cells is built on work done with microscopes. English scientist Robert\r\nHooke in 1665 first described cells from his observations of cork slices. Hooke first used the word\r\n\"cell\". Dutch amateur scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered microscopic animals in\r\nwater. German scientists Schleiden and Schwann in 1830's were first to say that all organisms are\r\nmade of one or more cells. German biologist Virchow in 1858 stated that all cells come from the\r\ndivision of pre-existing cells.\r\nThe Cell Theory can be summarized as:\r\nCells are the fundamental unit of life - nothing less than a cell is alive.\r\nAll organisms are constructed of and by cells.\r\nAll cells arise from preexisting cells. Cells contain the information necessary for their own\r\nreproduction. No new cells are originating spontaneously on earth today.\r\nCells are the functional units of life. All biochemical processes are carried out by cells. \u2022\r\nGroups of cells can be organized and function as multicellular organisms\r\nCells of multicellular organisms can become specialized in form and function to carry out\r\nsubprocesses of the multicellular organism.\r\nCells are common to all living beings, and provide information about all forms of life. Because\r\nall cells come from existing cells, scientists can study cells to learn about growth, reproduction,\r\nand all other functions that living things perform. By learning about cells and how they function,\r\nwe can learn about all types of living things.\r\nClassification of cells:\r\nAll living organisms (bacteria, blue green algae, plants and animals) have cellular organization\r\nand may contain one or many cells. The organisms with only one cell in their body are called\r\nunicellular organisms (bacteria, blue green algae, some algae, Protozoa, etc.). The organisms\r\nhaving many cells in their body are called multicellular organisms (fungi, most plants and\r\nanimals). Any living organism may contain only one type of cell either\r\nA. Prokaryotic cells; B. Eukaryotic cells.\r\nThe terms prokaryotic and eukaryotic were suggested by Hans Ris in the 1960\u2019s. This\r\nclassification is based on their complexity. Further based on the kingdom into which they may fall\r\ni.e the plant or the animal kingdom, plant and animal cells bear many differences. These will be\r\nstudied in detail in the upcoming sections\r\nPROKARYOTIC CELLS\r\nProkaryote comes from the Greek words for pre-nucleus. Prokaryotes:\r\ni. One circular chromosome, not contained in a membrane.\r\nii. No histones or introns are present in Bacteria; both are found in Eukaryotes and Archaea.\r\niii. No membrane-bound organelles. (Only contain non membrane-bound organelles).\r\niv. Bacteria contain peptidoglycan in cell walls; Eukaryotes and Archaea do not.\r\nv. Binary fission.\r\n2\r\nSize, Shape, and Arrangement of Bacterial Cells.\r\ni. Average size of prokaryotic cells: 0.2 -2.0 \u03bcm in diameter 1-10 \u03bcm (0.001 \u2013 0.01 mm) [book\r\nsays 2 \u2013 8 \u03bcm] in length.\r\n1. Typical eukaryote 10-500 \u03bcm in length (0.01 \u2013 0.5 mm).\r\n2. Typical virus 20-1000 nm in length (0.00000002 \u2013 0.000001 m).\r\n3. Thiomargarita is the largest bacterium known. It is about the size of a typed period (0.75\r\nmm).\r\n4. Nanoarchaeum is the smallest cell known. It is at the lower theoretical limit for cell size\r\n(0.4 \u03bcm).\r\nii. Basic bacterial shapes:\r\n1. Coccus (sphere/round).\r\n2. Bacillus (staff/rod-shaped).\r\n3. Spirilla (rigid with a spiral/corkscrew shape).\r\na. Flagella propel these bacteria.\r\n4. Vibrio (curved rod).\r\n5. Spirochetes (flexible with a spiral shape).\r\nAxial filaments (endoflagella) propel these bacteria.\r\niii. Descriptive prefixes:\r\n1. Diplo (two cells).\r\n2.

It can protect against dehydration.\r\nvi. It helps keep nutrients from moving out of the cell.\r\n1. A capsule is a glycocalyx that is neatly organized and is firmly attached to the\r\ncell wall. a. Capsules prevent phagocytosis by the host\u2019s immune system.\r\n2. A slime layer is a glycocalyx that is unorganized and is loosely attached to the\r\ncell wall.\r\nb. Extracellular\r\n polysaccharide (extracellular\r\n polymeric\r\n substance) is\r\n a\r\nglycocalyx made of sugars and allows bacterial cells to attach to various surfaces.Prokaryotic\r\nFlagella.\r\ni.

Phototaxis.\r\nc. Axial Filaments (Endoflagella).\r\ni. In spirochetes:\r\n1. Anchored at one end of a cell.\r\n2. Covered by an outer sheath.\r\n3. Rotation causes cell to move like a corkscrew through a cork.\r\nd. Fimbriae.\r\ni. Shorter, straighter, thinner than flagella.\r\nii. Not used for locomotion.\r\niii. Allow for the attachment of bacteria to surfaces.\r\niv. Can be found at the poles of the cell, or covering the cell\u2019s entire surface.\r\nv. There may be few or many fimbriae on a single bacterium.\r\ne. Pili (sex pili).\r\ni. Longer than fimbriae.\r\nii. Only one or two per cell.\r\niii. Are used to transfer DNA from one bacterial cell to another, and in twitching & gliding\r\nmotility.\r\nIV. The Prokaryotic Cell Wall.\r\na. Chemically and structurally complex, semi-rigid, gives structure to and protects the cell.\r\nb. Surrounds the underlying plasma membrane.\r\n4\r\nc. Prevents osmotic lysis.\r\nd. Contributes to the ability to cause disease in some species, and is the site of action for\r\nsome antibiotics.\r\ne. Made of peptidoglycan (in bacteria).\r\ni. Polymer of a disaccharide. 1. N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) & N-acetylmuramic\r\nacid (NAM). ii. Disaccharides linked by polypeptides to form lattice surrounding\r\nthe cell. Fig.\r\niii. Penicillin inhibits this lattice formation, and leads to cellular lysis.\r\nf. Gram-positive cell walls. Fig.\r\ni. Many layers of peptidoglycan, resulting in a thick, rigid structure.\r\nii. Teichoic acids.\r\n1. May regulate movement of cations (+).\r\n2. May be involved in cell growth, preventing extensive wall breakdown\r\nand lysis.\r\n3. Contribute to antigenic specificity for each Gram-positive bacterial\r\nspecies.\r\n4. Lipoteichoic acid links to plasma membrane.\r\n5. Wall teichoic acid links to peptidoglycan.\r\ng. Gram-negative cell walls.\r\ni. Contains only one or a few layers of peptidoglycan.\r\n1. Peptidoglycan is found in the periplasm, a fluid-filled space between the\r\nouter membrane and plasma membrane.\r\na. Periplasm contains many digestive enzymes and transport\r\nproteins.\r\nii. No teichoic acids are found in Gram-negative cell walls.\r\niii. More susceptible to rupture than Gram-positive cells.\r\niv. Outer membrane:\r\n1. Composed of lipopolysaccharides, lipoproteins, and phospholipids.\r\n2. Protects the cell from phagocytes, complement, antibiotics, lysozyme,\r\ndetergents, heavy metals, bile salts, and certain dyes.\r\n3. Contains transport proteins called porins.\r\n4. Lipopolysaccharide is composed of:\r\na. O polysaccharide (antigen) that can be used to ID certain Gram- negative\r\nbacterial species.\r\nb. Lipid A (endotoxin) can cause shock, fever, and even death if\r\nenough is released into the host\u2019s blood.\r\nh. Gram Stain Mechanism.\r\ni. Crystal Violet-Iodine (CV-I) crystals form within the cell.\r\nii. Gram-positive:\r\n1. Alcohol dehydrates peptidoglycan.\r\n2. CV-I crystals cannot leave.\r\niii. Gram-negative:\r\n1. Alcohol dissolves outer membrane and leaves holes in peptidoglycan.\r\n2. CV-I washes out. 3. Safranin stains the cell pink.\r\niv. Table 1, pg. 94, compares Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.\r\ni. Damage to Prokaryotic Cell Walls.\r\ni. Because prokaryotic cell walls contain substances not normally found in animal\r\n5\r\ncells, drugs or chemicals that disrupt prokaryotic cell wall structures are often used\r\nin medicine, or by the host to combat the bacteria.\r\n1. Lysozyme digests the disaccharides in peptidoglycan.\r\n2. Penicillin inhibits the formation of peptide bridges in peptidoglycan.\r\nii. A protoplast is a Gram-positive cell whose cell wall has been destroyed, but that\r\nis still alive and functional. (Lost its peptidoglycan).\r\niii. A spheroplast is a wall-less Gram-negative cell. (Lost its outer membrane and\r\npeptidoglycan).\r\niv. L forms are wall-less cells that swell into irregular shapes. They can live, divide,\r\nand may return to a walled state.\r\nv. Protoplasts and spheroplasts are susceptible to osmotic lysis.\r\nvi. Gram-negative bacteria are not as susceptible to penicillin due to the outer\r\nmembrane and the small amount of peptidoglycan in their walls.\r\nvii. Gram-negative bacteria are susceptible to antibiotics that can penetrate the\r\nouter membrane (Streptomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline).\r\nV. Structures Internal to the Cell Wall.\r\na. Plasma Membrane (Inner Membrane).\r\na. Phospholipid bilayer lying inside the cell wall.\r\n1. The phospholipid bilayer is the basic framework of the plasma membrane.\r\n2. The bilayer arrangement occurs because the phospholipids are amphipathic molecules.\r\nThey have both polar (charged) and nonpolar\r\n (uncharged) parts with the polar\r\n\u201chead\u201d of the phospholipid pointing out and the nonpolar \u201ctails\u201d pointing toward the center\r\nof the membrane, forming a nonpolar, hydrophobic region in the membrane\u2019s interior.\r\nb. Much of the metabolic machinery is located on the plasma membrane.\r\nPhotosynthesis, aerobic cellular respiration, and anaerobic cellular respiration\r\nreactions occur here. This means that there is a surface area to volume ratio at\r\nwhich bacteria reach a critical size threshold, beyond which bacteria can\u2019t survive.\r\ni. Thiomargarita (0.75 mm) is the largest known bacterium and is larger\r\nthan most eukaryotic cells. It has many invaginations of the plasma\r\nmembrane, which increases it surface area relative to its volume.\r\nc. Peripheral proteins.\r\ni. Enzymes.\r\nii. Structural proteins.\r\niii. Some assist the cell in changing membrane shape.\r\nd. Integral proteins and transmembrane proteins.\r\ni. Provide channels for movement of materials into and out of the cell.\r\ne. Fluid Mosaic Model.\r\ni. Membrane is as viscous as olive oil.\r\nii. Proteins move to function.\r\niii. Phospholipids rotate and move laterally.\r\nf. Selective permeability allows the passage of some molecules but not others\r\nacross the plasma membrane.\r\ni. Large molecules cannot pass through.\r\nii. Ions pass through very slowly or not at all.\r\niii. Lipid soluble molecules pass through easily.\r\niv.Smaller molecules (water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, some simple sugars)\r\n6\r\nusually pass through easily.\r\ng. The plasma membrane contains enzymes for ATP production.\r\nh. Photosynthetic pigments are found on in-foldings of the plasma membrane\r\ncalled chromatophores or thylakoids. Fig. 15.\r\ni. Damage to the plasma membrane by alcohols, quaternary ammonium\r\ncompounds (a class of disinfectants) and polymyxin antibiotics causes leakage of\r\ncell contents.\r\nj. Movement of Materials Across Membranes.\r\n1. Passive Processes:\r\na. Simple diffusion: Movement of a solute from an area of high concentration to an area of\r\nlow concentration (down its concentration gradient) until equilibrium is reached.\r\nb. Facilitated diffusion: Solute combines with a transport protein in the membrane, to pass\r\nfrom one side of the membrane to the other. The molecule is still moving down its\r\nconcentration gradient. The transport proteins are specific.\r\nc. Osmosis.\r\ni. Movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane from an area of\r\nhigher water concentration to an area of lower water concentration.\r\nii. Osmotic pressure.\r\nThe pressure needed to stop the movement of water across the membrane.\r\niii. Isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic solutions.\r\n2. Active Processes:\r\na. Active transport of substances requires a transporter protein and ATP. The solute\r\nmolecule is pumped against its concentration gradient. Transport proteins are specific. i. In\r\ngroup translocation (a special form of active transport found only in prokaryotes)\r\nmovement of a substance requires a specific transport protein. 1. The substance is\r\nchemically altered during transport, preventing it from escaping the cell after it is\r\ntransported inside. 2. This process requires high-energy phosphate compounds like\r\nphosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) to phosphorylate the transported molecule, preventing its\r\nmovement out of the cell.\r\nb. Cytoplasm.\r\ni. Cytoplasm is the substance inside the plasma membrane.\r\nii. It is about 80% water.\r\niii. Contains proteins, enzymes, carbohydrates, lipids, inorganic ions, various compounds,\r\na nuclear area, ribosomes, and inclusions.\r\nc. Nuclear Area (Nucleoid).\r\ni. Contains a single circular chromosome made of DNA.\r\n1. No histones or introns in bacteria.\r\n2. The chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at a point along its length,\r\nwhere proteins synthesize and partition new DNA for division during binary fission.\r\nii. Is not surrounded by a nuclear envelope the way eukaryotic chromosomes are.\r\niii. Also contains small circular DNA molecules called plasmids.\r\n1. Plasmids can be gained or lost without harming the cell.\r\n2. Usually contain less than 100 genes.\r\n3. Can be beneficial if they contain genes for antibiotic resistance, tolerance to\r\ntoxic metals, production of toxins, or synthesis of enzymes.\r\n4. They can be transferred from one bacterium to another.\r\n7\r\n5. Plasmids are used in genetic engineering.\r\nd. Ribosomes.\r\ni. Site of protein synthesis.\r\nii. Composed of a large and small subunit, both made of protein and rRNA. iii. Prokaryotic\r\nribosomes are 70S ribosomes.\r\n1. Made of a small 30S subunit and a larger 50S subunit.\r\niv. Eukaryotic ribosomes are 80S ribosomes.\r\n1. Made of a small 40S subunit and a larger 60S subunit.\r\nv. Certain antibiotics target only prokaryotic ribosomal subunits without targeting\r\neukaryotic ribosomal subunits.\r\ne. Inclusions.\r\ni. Reserve deposits of nutrients that can be used in times of low resource availability. ii.\r\nInclude:\r\n1. Metachromatic granules (volutin). Reserve of inorganic phosphate for ATP.\r\n2. Polysaccharide granules. Glycogen and starch.\r\n3. Lipid inclusions.\r\n4. Sulfur granules. Energy reserve for \u201csulfur bacteria\u201d that derive energy by\r\noxidizing sulfur and sulfur compounds.\r\n5. Carboxysomes. Contain an enzyme necessary for bacteria that use carbon\r\ndioxide as their only source of carbon for carbon dioxide fixation.\r\n6. Gas vacuoles. Help bacteria maintain buoyancy.\r\n7. Magnetosomes. Made of iron oxide, they serve as ballast to help some bacteria\r\nsink until reaching an appropriate attachment site. They also decompose hydrogen peroxide.\r\nf. Endospores.\r\ni. Resting Gram-positive bacterial cells that form when essential nutrients can no longer\r\nbe obtained.\r\nii. Resistant to desiccation, heat, chemicals, radiation.\r\niii. Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), Clostridium spp. (gangrene, tetanus, botulism, food\r\npoisoning).\r\niv. Sporulation (sporogenesis): the process of endospore formation within the vegetative\r\n(functional) cell. This takes several hours.\r\n1. Spore septum (invagination of plasma membrane) begins to isolate the newly\r\nreplicated DNA and a small portion of cytoplasm. This results in the formation of\r\ntwo separate membrane bound structures.\r\n2. The plasma membrane starts to surround the DNA, cytoplasm, and the new\r\nmembrane encircling the material isolated in step 1, forming a double-layered\r\nmembrane-bound structure called a forespore.\r\n3. Thick peptidoglycan layers are laid down between the two membranes of the\r\nforespore.\r\n4. Then a thick spore coat of protein forms around the outer membrane of the\r\nforespore, which is responsible for the durability of the endospore.\r\n5. When the endospore matures, the vegetative cell wall ruptures, killing the cell,\r\nand freeing the endospore.\r\na. The endospore is metabolically inert, and contains the chromosome,\r\n8\r\nsome RNA, ribosomes, enzymes, other molecules, and very little water.\r\nb. Endospores can remain dormant for millions of years.\r\nv. Germination: the return to the vegetative state.\r\n1. Triggered by damage to the endospore coat. The enzymes activate, breaking\r\ndown the protective layers. Water then can enter, and metabolism resumes.\r\nvi. Endospores can survive conditions that vegetative cells cannot: boiling, freezing,\r\ndesiccation, chemical exposure, radiation, etc.\r\n\r\nEUKARYOTES:\r\na. Make up algae, protozoa, fungi, higher plants, and animals.\r\nFlagella and Cilia. Rotate Cilia are numerous, short, hair-like projections extending from the surface of a\r\ncell. They function to move materials across the surface of the cell, or move the cell around in its\r\nenvironment.\r\ni. Flagella are similar to cilia but are much longer, usually moving an entire cell. The only\r\nexample of a flagellum in the human body is the sperm cell tail.\r\n1. Eukaryotic flagella move in a whip-like manner, while prokaryotic flagella\r\n9\r\nb. Cell Wall.\r\ni. Simple compared to prokaryotes.\r\n1. No peptidoglycan in eukaryotes.\r\na. Antibiotics that target peptidoglycan (penicillins and cephalosporins) do\r\nnot harm us.\r\nii. Cell walls are found in plants, algae, and fungi.\r\niii. Made of carbohydrates.\r\n1. Cellulose in algae, plants, and some fungi.\r\n2. Chitin in most fungi. 3. Glucan and mannan in yeasts (unicellular fungi).\r\nc. Glycocalyx.\r\ni. Sticky carbohydrates extending from an animal cell\u2019s plasma membrane.\r\nii. Glycoproteins and glycolipids form a sugary coat around the cell\u2014the glycocalyx\u2014\r\nwhich helps cells recognize one another, adhere to one another in some tissues, and protects\r\nthe cell\r\n from digestion by enzymes in the extracellular fluid.\r\n1. The glycocalyx also attracts a film of fluid to the surface of many cells, such as\r\nRBC\u2019s, making them slippery so they can pass through narrow vessels.\r\nd. Plasma Membrane.\r\ni. The plasma membrane is a flexible, sturdy barrier that surrounds and contains the\r\ncytoplasm of the cell.\r\n1. The fluid mosaic model describes its structure.\r\n2. The membrane consists of proteins in a sea of phospholipids.\r\na. Some proteins float freely while others are anchored at specific\r\nlocations.\r\nb. The membrane lipids allow passage of several types of lipid-soluble\r\nmolecules but act as a barrier to the passage of charged or polar substances.\r\nc. Channel and transport proteins allow movement of polar molecules and\r\nions across the membrane.\r\nii. Phospholipid bilayer.\r\n1. Has the same basic arrangement as the prokaryotic plasma membrane.\r\niii. Arrangement of Membrane Proteins.\r\n1. The membrane proteins are divided into integral and peripheral proteins.\r\na. Integral proteins extend into or across the entire lipid bilayer among the fatty acid tails\r\nof the phospholipid molecules, and are firmly anchored in place.\r\ni. Most are transmembrane proteins, which span the entire lipid bilayer and protrude into\r\nboth the cytosol and extracellular fluid.\r\nb. Peripheral proteins associate loosely with the polar heads of membrane lipids,\r\nand are found at the inner or outer surface of the membrane.\r\n10\r\n2. Many membrane proteins are glycoproteins (proteins with carbohydrate groups\r\nattached to the ends that protrude into the extracellular fluid).\r\niv. Functions of Membrane Proteins.\r\n1. Membrane proteins vary in different cells and function as:\r\na. Ion channels (pores): Allow ions such as sodium or potassium to cross the cell\r\nmembrane; (they can't diffuse through the bilayer). Most are selective\u2014they allow only a\r\nsingle type of ion to pass. Some ion channels open and close.\r\nb. Transporters: selectively move a polar substance from one side of the membrane to\r\nthe other.\r\nc. Receptors: recognize and bind a specific molecule. The chemical binding to the receptor\r\nis called a ligand.\r\nd. Enzymes: catalyze specific chemical reactions at the inside or outside surface of the\r\ncell.\r\ne. Cell-identity markers (often glycoproteins and glycolipids), such as human leukocyte\r\nantigens.\r\nf. Linkers: anchor proteins in the plasma membrane of neighboring cells to each other or\r\nto protein filaments inside and outside the cell.\r\n2. The different proteins help to determine many of the functions of the plasma membrane.\r\nv. Selective permeability of the plasma membrane allows passage of some molecules.\r\n1. Transport mechanisms:\r\na. Simple diffusion. b. Facilitated diffusion. c. Osmosis. d. Active transport. (No\r\ngroup translocation in Eukaryotes). e. Vesicular Transport.\r\ni. A vesicle is a small membranous sac formed by budding off from an existing membrane.\r\nii. Two types of vesicular transport are endocytosis and exocytosis.\r\n1. Endocytosis.\r\na. In endocytosis, materials move into a cell in a vesicle formed from the plasma\r\nmembrane.\r\nb. Viruses can take advantage of this mechanism to enter cells.\r\nc. Phagocytosis is the ingestion of solid particles, such as worn out cells, bacteria, or viruses.\r\nPseudopods extend and engulf particles.\r\nd. Pinocytosis is the ingestion of extracellular fluid. The membrane folds inward bringing in fluid\r\nand dissolved substances.\r\n2. In exocytosis, membrane-enclosed structures called secretory\r\nvesicles that form inside the cell fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents into\r\nthe extracellular fluid.\r\nf. Cytoplasm.\r\ni. Substance inside the plasma membrane and outside nucleus.\r\nii. Cytosol is the fluid portion of cytoplasm.\r\niii. Cytoskeleton.\r\n1. The cytoskeleton is a network of several kinds of protein filaments that extend\r\nthroughout the cytoplasm, and provides a structural framework for the cell.\r\n2. It consists of microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules.\r\n11\r\na. Most microfilaments (the smallest cytoskeletal elements) are composed\r\nof actin and function in movement (muscle contraction and cell division) and mechanical support\r\nfor the cell itself and for microvilli.\r\nb. Intermediate filaments are composed of several different proteins and\r\nfunction in support and to help anchor organelles such as the nucleus.\r\nc. Microtubules (the largest cytoskeletal elements) are composed of a\r\nprotein called tubulin and help\r\n determine cell shape; they function in the intracellular\r\ntransport of organelles and the migration of chromosome during cell division. They also\r\nfunction in the movement of cilia and flagella.\r\niv. Cytoplasmic streaming.\r\n1. Movement of cytoplasm and nutrients throughout cells.\r\n2. Moves the cell over surfaces.\r\ng. Organelles.\r\ni. Organelles are specialized structures that have characteristic shapes and perform\r\nspecific functions in eukaryotic cellular growth, maintenance, reproduction.\r\n2.1.RIBOSOMES.\r\nNucleus.\r\nThe nucleus is usually the most prominent feature of a eukaryotic cell.\r\nb. Most have a single nucleus; some cells (human red blood cells) have none, whereas\r\nothers (human skeletal muscle fibers) have several in each cell.\r\nc. The parts of the nucleus include the:\r\ni. Nuclear envelope (a double membrane), which is perforated by channels called nuclear\r\npores, that control the movement of substances between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.\r\n1. Small molecules and ions diffuse passively, while movement of most large molecules\r\nout of the nucleus involves active transport.\r\nii. Nucleoli function in producing ribosomes. d. Genetic material (DNA). Within the\r\nnucleus are the cell\u2019s hereditary units, called genes, which are arranged in single file along\r\nchromosomes. Each chromosome is a long molecule of DNA that is coiled together with\r\nseveral proteins (including histones).\r\na. Sites of protein synthesis.\r\nb. 80S in eukaryotes.\r\ni. Membrane-bound ribosomes found on rough ER.\r\nii. Free ribosomes found in cytoplasm.\r\nc. 70S in prokaryotes.\r\ni. Also found in chloroplasts and mitochondria.\r\n3. Endoplasmic Reticulum.\r\na. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network of membranes extending from the nuclear\r\nmembrane that form flattened sacs or tubules.\r\nb. Rough ER is continuous with the nuclear membrane and has its outer surface studded\r\nwith ribosomes, which synthesize proteins. The proteins then enter the space inside the ER\r\nfor processing (into glycoproteins or for attachment to phospholipids) and sorting,\r\n12\r\nand are then either incorporated into organelle membranes, inserted into the plasma\r\nmembrane, or secreted via exocytosis.\r\nc. Smooth ER extends from the rough ER to form a network of membrane tubules, but it\r\ndoes not contain ribosomes on its membrane surface. In humans, it synthesizes fatty acids\r\nand steroids, detoxifies drugs, removes phosphate from glucose 6-phosphate (allowing free\r\nglucose to enter the blood), and stores and releases calcium ions involved in muscle\r\ncontraction.\r\n4. Golgi Complex.\r\nThe Golgi complex consists of four to six stacked, flattened membranous sacs (cisterns).\r\nThe cis (entry) face faces the rough ER, and trans (exit) face faces the cell\u2019s plasma\r\nmembrane. Between the cis and trans faces are the medial cisternae.\r\nb. The cis, medial, and trans cisternae each contain different enzymes that permit each to\r\nmodify, sort, and package proteins received from the rough ER for transport to different\r\ndestinations (such as the plasma membrane, to other organelles, or for export out of the\r\ncell).\r\n5. Lysosomes.\r\na. Lysosomes are membrane-enclosed vesicles that form from the Golgi complex and\r\ncontain powerful digestive enzymes.\r\nb. Lysosomes function in digestion of substances that enter the cell by endocytosis, and\r\ntransport the final products of digestion into the cytosol.\r\nc. They digest worn-out organelles (autophagy).\r\nd. They digest their own cellular contents (autolysis).\r\ne. They carry out extracellular digestion (as happens when sperm release lysosomal\r\nenzymes to aid in penetrating an oocyte).\r\n6. Vacuoles.\r\na. Space in the cytoplasm enclosed by a membrane called a tonoplast.\r\nb. Derived from the Golgi complex.\r\nc. They serve in the following ways:\r\ni. Temporary storage for biological molecules and ions.\r\nii. Bring food into cells.\r\niii. Provide structural support.\r\niv. Store metabolic wastes.\r\n7. Peroxisomes.\r\na. Peroxisomes are similar in structure to lysosomes, but are smaller.\r\nb. They contain enzymes (oxidases) that use molecular oxygen to oxidize (remove\r\nhydrogen atoms from) various organic substances.\r\n13\r\nc. They take part in normal metabolic reactions such as the oxidation of amino and fatty\r\nacids.\r\nd. New peroxisomes form by budding off from preexisting ones.\r\ne. They produce and then destroy H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) in the process of their\r\nmetabolic activities.\r\n8. Centrosomes.\r\na. Centrosomes are dense areas of cytoplasm containing the centrioles, which are paired\r\ncylinders arranged at right angles to one another, and serve as centers for organizing\r\nmicrotubules and the mitotic spindle during mitosis.\r\n9. Mitochondria.\r\na. Found in nearly all eukaryotic cells.\r\nb. A mitochondrion is bound by a double membrane, with a fluid-filled space between\r\ncalled the intermembranous space. The outer membrane is smooth, while the inner\r\nmembrane is arranged in folds called cristae. The mitochondrial matrix is found inside the\r\ninner mitochondrial membrane.\r\nc. The folds of the cristae provide a large surface area for the chemical reactions that are\r\npart of the aerobic phase of cellular respiration. These reactions produce most of a\r\neukaryotic cell\u2019s ATP, and the enzymes that catalyze them are located on the cristae and\r\nin the matrix.\r\nd. Mitochondria self-replicate using their own DNA and contain 70S ribosomes. They\r\ngrow and reproduce on their own in a way that is similar to binary fission. Mitochondrial\r\nDNA (genes) is inherited only from the mother, since sperm normally lack most organelles\r\nsuch as mitochondria, ribosomes, ER, and the Golgi complex. Any sperm mitochondria\r\nthat do enter the oocyte are soon destroyed.\r\n10. Chloroplasts.\r\na. Found only in algae and green plants.\r\nb. Contain the pigment chlorophyll and enzymes necessary for photosynthesis.\r\nc. Chloroplasts self-replicate using their own DNA and contain 70S ribosomes. They grow\r\nand reproduce on their own in a way that is similar to binary fission.\r\nVII. Endosymbiotic Theory.\r\na. Large bacterial cells lost their cell walls and engulfed smaller bacteria.\r\nb. A symbiotic (mutualistic) relationship developed.\r\ni. The host cell supplied the nutrients.\r\nii. The engulfed cell produced excess energy that the host could use.\r\niii. The relationship evolved.\r\nc. Evidence:\r\n14\r\ni. Mitochondria and chloroplasts resemble bacteria in size and shape.\r\n1. They divide on their own\u2014independently of the host, and contain their own DNA\r\n(single circular chromosome). This process is nearly identical to binary fission seen in\r\nbacteria.\r\n2. They contain 70S ribosomes.\r\n3. Their method of protein synthesis is more like that of prokaryotes (no RNA processing).\r\n4. Antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis on ribosomes in bacteria also inhibit protein\r\nDifference among eukaryotic cells\r\nThere are many different types of eukaryotic cells, though animals and plants are the most\r\nfamiliar eukaryotes, and thus provide an excellent starting point for understanding\r\neukaryotic structure. Fungi and many protists have some substantial differences, however.\r\nAnimal cell\r\nAn animal cell is a form of eukaryotic cell that makes up many tissues in animals. Animal\r\ncells are distinct from other eukaryotes, most notably plant cells, as they lack cell walls and\r\nchloroplasts. They also have smaller vacuoles. Due to the lack of a cell wall, animal cells\r\ncan adopt a variety of shapes. A phagocytic cell can even engulf other structures.\r\nThere are many different types of cell. For instance, there are approximately 210 distinct\r\ncell types in the adult human body.\r\nPlant cell\r\nPlant cells are quite different from the cells of the other eukaryotic organisms. Their\r\ndistinctive features are:\r\nA large central vacuole (enclosed by a membrane, the tonoplast), which maintains the cell's\r\nturgor and controls movement ofmolecules between the cytosol and sap\r\nA primary cell wall containing cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin, deposited by the\r\nprotoplast on the outside of the cell membrane; this contrasts with the cell walls of fungi, which\r\ncontain chitin, and the cell envelopes of prokaryotes, in which peptidoglycans are the main\r\nstructural molecules\r\nThe plasmodesmata, linking pores in the cell wall that allow each plant cell to communicate\r\nwith other adjacent cells; this is different from the functionally analogous system of gap\r\njunctions between animal cells.\r\n15\r\nPlastids, especially chloroplasts that contain chlorophyll, the pigment that gives\r\nplants their green color and allows them to perform photosynthesis\r\nBryophytes and seedless vascular plants lack flagellae and centrioles except in the sperm\r\ncells.[16] Sperm of cycads and Ginkgoare large, complex cells that swim with hundreds to\r\nthousands of flagellae.\r\nConifers (Pinophyta)\r\n and flowering\r\n plants (Angiospermae)\r\n lack\r\nthe flagellae and centrioles that are present in animal cells.\r\n\r\n", "full_prompt": "You can only respond using information from the context provided. Arrange the answers in numbered list with headers.\n\nWhat are the differences between the types of cells described and some life forms they make up.\n\nCELL STRUCTURE\r\nCells are the building blocks of life. A cell is chemical system that is able to maintain its structure\r\nand reproduce. Cells are the fundamental unit of life. All living things are cells or composed of\r\ncells. Although different living things may be as unlike as a violet and an octopus, they are all built\r\nin essentially the same way. The most basic similarity is that all living things are composed of one\r\nor more cells. This is known as the Cell Theory.\r\nOur knowledge of cells is built on work done with microscopes. English scientist Robert\r\nHooke in 1665 first described cells from his observations of cork slices. Hooke first used the word\r\n\"cell\". Dutch amateur scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek discovered microscopic animals in\r\nwater. German scientists Schleiden and Schwann in 1830's were first to say that all organisms are\r\nmade of one or more cells. German biologist Virchow in 1858 stated that all cells come from the\r\ndivision of pre-existing cells.\r\nThe Cell Theory can be summarized as:\r\nCells are the fundamental unit of life - nothing less than a cell is alive.\r\nAll organisms are constructed of and by cells.\r\nAll cells arise from preexisting cells. Cells contain the information necessary for their own\r\nreproduction. No new cells are originating spontaneously on earth today.\r\nCells are the functional units of life. All biochemical processes are carried out by cells. \u2022\r\nGroups of cells can be organized and function as multicellular organisms\r\nCells of multicellular organisms can become specialized in form and function to carry out\r\nsubprocesses of the multicellular organism.\r\nCells are common to all living beings, and provide information about all forms of life. Because\r\nall cells come from existing cells, scientists can study cells to learn about growth, reproduction,\r\nand all other functions that living things perform. By learning about cells and how they function,\r\nwe can learn about all types of living things.\r\nClassification of cells:\r\nAll living organisms (bacteria, blue green algae, plants and animals) have cellular organization\r\nand may contain one or many cells. The organisms with only one cell in their body are called\r\nunicellular organisms (bacteria, blue green algae, some algae, Protozoa, etc.). The organisms\r\nhaving many cells in their body are called multicellular organisms (fungi, most plants and\r\nanimals). Any living organism may contain only one type of cell either\r\nA. Prokaryotic cells; B. Eukaryotic cells.\r\nThe terms prokaryotic and eukaryotic were suggested by Hans Ris in the 1960\u2019s. This\r\nclassification is based on their complexity. Further based on the kingdom into which they may fall\r\ni.e the plant or the animal kingdom, plant and animal cells bear many differences. These will be\r\nstudied in detail in the upcoming sections\r\nPROKARYOTIC CELLS\r\nProkaryote comes from the Greek words for pre-nucleus. Prokaryotes:\r\ni. One circular chromosome, not contained in a membrane.\r\nii. No histones or introns are present in Bacteria; both are found in Eukaryotes and Archaea.\r\niii. No membrane-bound organelles.

Table 1, pg. 94, compares Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.\r\ni. Damage to Prokaryotic Cell Walls.\r\ni. Because prokaryotic cell walls contain substances not normally found in animal\r\n5\r\ncells, drugs or chemicals that disrupt prokaryotic cell wall structures are often used\r\nin medicine, or by the host to combat the bacteria.\r\n1. Lysozyme digests the disaccharides in peptidoglycan.\r\n2. Penicillin inhibits the formation of peptide bridges in peptidoglycan.\r\nii. A protoplast is a Gram-positive cell whose cell wall has been destroyed, but that\r\nis still alive and functional. (Lost its peptidoglycan).\r\niii. A spheroplast is a wall-less Gram-negative cell. (Lost its outer membrane and\r\npeptidoglycan).\r\niv. L forms are wall-less cells that swell into irregular shapes. They can live, divide,\r\nand may return to a walled state.\r\nv. Protoplasts and spheroplasts are susceptible to osmotic lysis.\r\nvi. Gram-negative bacteria are not as susceptible to penicillin due to the outer\r\nmembrane and the small amount of peptidoglycan in their walls.\r\nvii. Gram-negative bacteria are susceptible to antibiotics that can penetrate the\r\nouter membrane (Streptomycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline).\r\nV. Structures Internal to the Cell Wall.\r\na. Plasma Membrane (Inner Membrane).\r\na. Phospholipid bilayer lying inside the cell wall.\r\n1. The phospholipid bilayer is the basic framework of the plasma membrane.\r\n2. The bilayer arrangement occurs because the phospholipids are amphipathic molecules.\r\nThey have both polar (charged) and nonpolar\r\n (uncharged) parts with the polar\r\n\u201chead\u201d of the phospholipid pointing out and the nonpolar \u201ctails\u201d pointing toward the center\r\nof the membrane, forming a nonpolar, hydrophobic region in the membrane\u2019s interior.\r\nb. Much of the metabolic machinery is located on the plasma membrane.\r\nPhotosynthesis, aerobic cellular respiration, and anaerobic cellular respiration\r\nreactions occur here. This means that there is a surface area to volume ratio at\r\nwhich bacteria reach a critical size threshold, beyond which bacteria can\u2019t survive.\r\ni. Thiomargarita (0.75 mm) is the largest known bacterium and is larger\r\nthan most eukaryotic cells. It has many invaginations of the plasma\r\nmembrane, which increases it surface area relative to its volume.\r\nc. Peripheral proteins.\r\ni. Enzymes.\r\nii. Structural proteins.\r\niii. Some assist the cell in changing membrane shape.\r\nd. Integral proteins and transmembrane proteins.\r\ni. Provide channels for movement of materials into and out of the cell.\r\ne. Fluid Mosaic Model.\r\ni. Membrane is as viscous as olive oil.\r\nii. Proteins move to function.\r\niii. Phospholipids rotate and move laterally.\r\nf. Selective permeability allows the passage of some molecules but not others\r\nacross the plasma membrane.\r\ni. Large molecules cannot pass through.\r\nii. Ions pass through very slowly or not at all.\r\niii. Lipid soluble molecules pass through easily.\r\niv.Smaller molecules (water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, some simple sugars)\r\n6\r\nusually pass through easily.\r\ng. The plasma membrane contains enzymes for ATP production.\r\nh. Photosynthetic pigments are found on in-foldings of the plasma membrane\r\ncalled chromatophores or thylakoids. Fig. 15.\r\ni. Damage to the plasma membrane by alcohols, quaternary ammonium\r\ncompounds (a class of disinfectants) and polymyxin antibiotics causes leakage of\r\ncell contents.\r\nj. Movement of Materials Across Membranes.\r\n1. Passive Processes:\r\na. Simple diffusion: Movement of a solute from an area of high concentration to an area of\r\nlow concentration (down its concentration gradient) until equilibrium is reached.\r\nb. Facilitated diffusion: Solute combines with a transport protein in the membrane, to pass\r\nfrom one side of the membrane to the other. The molecule is still moving down its\r\nconcentration gradient. The transport proteins are specific.\r\nc. Osmosis.\r\ni. Movement of water across a selectively permeable membrane from an area of\r\nhigher water concentration to an area of lower water concentration.\r\nii. Osmotic pressure.\r\nThe pressure needed to stop the movement of water across the membrane.\r\niii. Isotonic, hypotonic, and hypertonic solutions.\r\n2. Active Processes:\r\na. Active transport of substances requires a transporter protein and ATP. The solute\r\nmolecule is pumped against its concentration gradient. Transport proteins are specific. i. In\r\ngroup translocation (a special form of active transport found only in prokaryotes)\r\nmovement of a substance requires a specific transport protein. 1. The substance is\r\nchemically altered during transport, preventing it from escaping the cell after it is\r\ntransported inside. 2. This process requires high-energy phosphate compounds like\r\nphosphoenolpyruvic acid (PEP) to phosphorylate the transported molecule, preventing its\r\nmovement out of the cell.\r\nb. Cytoplasm.\r\ni. Cytoplasm is the substance inside the plasma membrane.\r\nii. It is about 80% water.\r\niii. Contains proteins, enzymes, carbohydrates, lipids, inorganic ions, various compounds,\r\na nuclear area, ribosomes, and inclusions.\r\nc. Nuclear Area (Nucleoid).\r\ni. Contains a single circular chromosome made of DNA.\r\n1. No histones or introns in bacteria.\r\n2. The chromosome is attached to the plasma membrane at a point along its length,\r\nwhere proteins synthesize and partition new DNA for division during binary fission.\r\nii. Is not surrounded by a nuclear envelope the way eukaryotic chromosomes are.\r\niii. Also contains small circular DNA molecules called plasmids.\r\n1. Plasmids can be gained or lost without harming the cell.\r\n2. Usually contain less than 100 genes.\r\n3. Can be beneficial if they contain genes for antibiotic resistance, tolerance to\r\ntoxic metals, production of toxins, or synthesis of enzymes.\r\n4. They can be transferred from one bacterium to another.\r\n7\r\n5. Plasmids are used in genetic engineering.\r\nd. Ribosomes.\r\ni. Site of protein synthesis.\r\nii. Composed of a large and small subunit, both made of protein and rRNA. iii. Prokaryotic\r\nribosomes are 70S ribosomes.\r\n1. Made of a small 30S subunit and a larger 50S subunit.\r\niv. Eukaryotic ribosomes are 80S ribosomes.\r\n1. Made of a small 40S subunit and a larger 60S subunit.\r\nv. Certain antibiotics target only prokaryotic ribosomal subunits without targeting\r\neukaryotic ribosomal subunits.\r\ne. Inclusions.\r\ni. Reserve deposits of nutrients that can be used in times of low resource availability. ii.\r\nInclude:\r\n1. Metachromatic granules (volutin). Reserve of inorganic phosphate for ATP.\r\n2. Polysaccharide granules. Glycogen and starch.\r\n3. Lipid inclusions.\r\n4. Sulfur granules. Energy reserve for \u201csulfur bacteria\u201d that derive energy by\r\noxidizing sulfur and sulfur compounds.\r\n5. Carboxysomes. Contain an enzyme necessary for bacteria that use carbon\r\ndioxide as their only source of carbon for carbon dioxide fixation.\r\n6. Gas vacuoles. Help bacteria maintain buoyancy.\r\n7. Magnetosomes. Made of iron oxide, they serve as ballast to help some bacteria\r\nsink until reaching an appropriate attachment site. They also decompose hydrogen peroxide.\r\nf. Endospores.\r\ni. Resting Gram-positive bacterial cells that form when essential nutrients can no longer\r\nbe obtained.\r\nii. Resistant to desiccation, heat, chemicals, radiation.\r\niii. Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), Clostridium spp. (gangrene, tetanus, botulism, food\r\npoisoning).\r\niv. Sporulation (sporogenesis): the process of endospore formation within the vegetative\r\n(functional) cell. This takes several hours.\r\n1. Spore septum (invagination of plasma membrane) begins to isolate the newly\r\nreplicated DNA and a small portion of cytoplasm. This results in the formation of\r\ntwo separate membrane bound structures.\r\n2. The plasma membrane starts to surround the DNA, cytoplasm, and the new\r\nmembrane encircling the material isolated in step 1, forming a double-layered\r\nmembrane-bound structure called a forespore.\r\n3. Thick peptidoglycan layers are laid down between the two membranes of the\r\nforespore.\r\n4. Then a thick spore coat of protein forms around the outer membrane of the\r\nforespore, which is responsible for the durability of the endospore.\r\n5. When the endospore matures, the vegetative cell wall ruptures, killing the cell,\r\nand freeing the endospore.\r\na. The endospore is metabolically inert, and contains the chromosome,\r\n8\r\nsome RNA, ribosomes, enzymes, other molecules, and very little water.\r\nb. Endospores can remain dormant for millions of years.\r\nv. Germination: the return to the vegetative state.\r\n1. Triggered by damage to the endospore coat. The enzymes activate, breaking\r\ndown the protective layers. Water then can enter, and metabolism resumes.\r\nvi. Endospores can survive conditions that vegetative cells cannot: boiling, freezing,\r\ndesiccation, chemical exposure, radiation, etc.\r\n\r\nEUKARYOTES:\r\na. Make up algae, protozoa, fungi, higher plants, and animals.\r\nFlagella and Cilia. Rotate Cilia are numerous, short, hair-like projections extending from the surface of a\r\ncell. They function to move materials across the surface of the cell, or move the cell around in its\r\nenvironment.\r\ni. Flagella are similar to cilia but are much longer, usually moving an entire cell. The only\r\nexample of a flagellum in the human body is the sperm cell tail.\r\n1. Eukaryotic flagella move in a whip-like manner, while prokaryotic flagella\r\n9\r\nb. Cell Wall.\r\ni. Simple compared to prokaryotes.\r\n1. No peptidoglycan in eukaryotes.\r\na. Antibiotics that target peptidoglycan (penicillins and cephalosporins) do\r\nnot harm us.\r\nii. Cell walls are found in plants, algae, and fungi.\r\niii. Made of carbohydrates.\r\n1. Cellulose in algae, plants, and some fungi.\r\n2. Chitin in most fungi. 3. Glucan and mannan in yeasts (unicellular fungi).\r\nc. Glycocalyx.\r\ni. Sticky carbohydrates extending from an animal cell\u2019s plasma membrane.\r\nii. Glycoproteins and glycolipids form a sugary coat around the cell\u2014the glycocalyx\u2014\r\nwhich helps cells recognize one another, adhere to one another in some tissues, and protects\r\nthe cell\r\n from digestion by enzymes in the extracellular fluid.\r\n1. The glycocalyx also attracts a film of fluid to the surface of many cells, such as\r\nRBC\u2019s, making them slippery so they can pass through narrow vessels.\r\nd. Plasma Membrane.\r\ni. The plasma membrane is a flexible, sturdy barrier that surrounds and contains the\r\ncytoplasm of the cell.\r\n1. The fluid mosaic model describes its structure.\r\n2. The membrane consists of proteins in a sea of phospholipids.\r\na. Some proteins float freely while others are anchored at specific\r\nlocations.\r\nb. The membrane lipids allow passage of several types of lipid-soluble\r\nmolecules but act as a barrier to the passage of charged or polar substances.\r\nc. Channel and transport proteins allow movement of polar molecules and\r\nions across the membrane.\r\nii. Phospholipid bilayer.\r\n1. Has the same basic arrangement as the prokaryotic plasma membrane.\r\niii. Arrangement of Membrane Proteins.\r\n1. The membrane proteins are divided into integral and peripheral proteins.\r\na. Integral proteins extend into or across the entire lipid bilayer among the fatty acid tails\r\nof the phospholipid molecules, and are firmly anchored in place.\r\ni. Most are transmembrane proteins, which span the entire lipid bilayer and protrude into\r\nboth the cytosol and extracellular fluid.\r\nb. Peripheral proteins associate loosely with the polar heads of membrane lipids,\r\nand are found at the inner or outer surface of the membrane.\r\n10\r\n2. Many membrane proteins are glycoproteins (proteins with carbohydrate groups\r\nattached to the ends that protrude into the extracellular fluid).\r\niv. Functions of Membrane Proteins.\r\n1. Membrane proteins vary in different cells and function as:\r\na. Ion channels (pores): Allow ions such as sodium or potassium to cross the cell\r\nmembrane; (they can't diffuse through the bilayer). Most are selective\u2014they allow only a\r\nsingle type of ion to pass. Some ion channels open and close.\r\nb. Transporters: selectively move a polar substance from one side of the membrane to\r\nthe other.\r\nc. Receptors: recognize and bind a specific molecule. The chemical binding to the receptor\r\nis called a ligand.\r\nd. Enzymes: catalyze specific chemical reactions at the inside or outside surface of the\r\ncell.\r\ne. Cell-identity markers (often glycoproteins and glycolipids), such as human leukocyte\r\nantigens.\r\nf. Linkers: anchor proteins in the plasma membrane of neighboring cells to each other or\r\nto protein filaments inside and outside the cell.\r\n2. The different proteins help to determine many of the functions of the plasma membrane.\r\nv. Selective permeability of the plasma membrane allows passage of some molecules.\r\n1. Transport mechanisms:\r\na. Simple diffusion. b. Facilitated diffusion. c. Osmosis. d. Active transport. (No\r\ngroup translocation in Eukaryotes). e. Vesicular Transport.\r\ni. A vesicle is a small membranous sac formed by budding off from an existing membrane.\r\nii. Two types of vesicular transport are endocytosis and exocytosis.\r\n1. Endocytosis.\r\na. In endocytosis, materials move into a cell in a vesicle formed from the plasma\r\nmembrane.\r\nb. Viruses can take advantage of this mechanism to enter cells.\r\nc. Phagocytosis is the ingestion of solid particles, such as worn out cells, bacteria, or viruses.\r\nPseudopods extend and engulf particles.\r\nd. Pinocytosis is the ingestion of extracellular fluid. The membrane folds inward bringing in fluid\r\nand dissolved substances.\r\n2. In exocytosis, membrane-enclosed structures called secretory\r\nvesicles that form inside the cell fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents into\r\nthe extracellular fluid.\r\nf. Cytoplasm.\r\ni. Substance inside the plasma membrane and outside nucleus.\r\nii. Cytosol is the fluid portion of cytoplasm.\r\niii. Cytoskeleton.\r\n1. The cytoskeleton is a network of several kinds of protein filaments that extend\r\nthroughout the cytoplasm, and provides a structural framework for the cell.\r\n2. It consists of microfilaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules.\r\n11\r\na. Most microfilaments (the smallest cytoskeletal elements) are composed\r\nof actin and function in movement (muscle contraction and cell division) and mechanical support\r\nfor the cell itself and for microvilli.\r\nb. Intermediate filaments are composed of several different proteins and\r\nfunction in support and to help anchor organelles such as the nucleus.\r\nc. Microtubules (the largest cytoskeletal elements) are composed of a\r\nprotein called tubulin and help\r\n determine cell shape; they function in the intracellular\r\ntransport of organelles and the migration of chromosome during cell division. They also\r\nfunction in the movement of cilia and flagella.\r\niv. Cytoplasmic streaming.\r\n1. Movement of cytoplasm and nutrients throughout cells.\r\n2. Moves the cell over surfaces.\r\ng. Organelles.\r\ni. Organelles are specialized structures that have characteristic shapes and perform\r\nspecific functions in eukaryotic cellular growth, maintenance, reproduction.\r\n2.1.RIBOSOMES.\r\nNucleus.\r\nThe nucleus is usually the most prominent feature of a eukaryotic cell.\r\nb. Most have a single nucleus; some cells (human red blood cells) have none, whereas\r\nothers (human skeletal muscle fibers) have several in each cell.\r\nc. The parts of the nucleus include the:\r\ni. Nuclear envelope (a double membrane), which is perforated by channels called nuclear\r\npores, that control the movement of substances between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.\r\n1. Small molecules and ions diffuse passively, while movement of most large molecules\r\nout of the nucleus involves active transport.\r\nii. Nucleoli function in producing ribosomes. d. Genetic material (DNA). Within the\r\nnucleus are the cell\u2019s hereditary units, called genes, which are arranged in single file along\r\nchromosomes. Each chromosome is a long molecule of DNA that is coiled together with\r\nseveral proteins (including histones).\r\na. Sites of protein synthesis.\r\nb. 80S in eukaryotes.\r\ni. Membrane-bound ribosomes found on rough ER.\r\nii. Free ribosomes found in cytoplasm.\r\nc. 70S in prokaryotes.\r\ni. Also found in chloroplasts and mitochondria.\r\n3. Endoplasmic Reticulum.\r\na. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a network of membranes extending from the nuclear\r\nmembrane that form flattened sacs or tubules.\r\nb. Rough ER is continuous with the nuclear membrane and has its outer surface studded\r\nwith ribosomes, which synthesize proteins. The proteins then enter the space inside the ER\r\nfor processing (into glycoproteins or for attachment to phospholipids) and sorting,\r\n12\r\nand are then either incorporated into organelle membranes, inserted into the plasma\r\nmembrane, or secreted via exocytosis.\r\nc. Smooth ER extends from the rough ER to form a network of membrane tubules, but it\r\ndoes not contain ribosomes on its membrane surface. In humans, it synthesizes fatty acids\r\nand steroids, detoxifies drugs, removes phosphate from glucose 6-phosphate (allowing free\r\nglucose to enter the blood), and stores and releases calcium ions involved in muscle\r\ncontraction.\r\n4. Golgi Complex.\r\nThe Golgi complex consists of four to six stacked, flattened membranous sacs (cisterns).\r\nThe cis (entry) face faces the rough ER, and trans (exit) face faces the cell\u2019s plasma\r\nmembrane. Between the cis and trans faces are the medial cisternae.\r\nb. The cis, medial, and trans cisternae each contain different enzymes that permit each to\r\nmodify, sort, and package proteins received from the rough ER for transport to different\r\ndestinations (such as the plasma membrane, to other organelles, or for export out of the\r\ncell).\r\n5. Lysosomes.\r\na. Lysosomes are membrane-enclosed vesicles that form from the Golgi complex and\r\ncontain powerful digestive enzymes.\r\nb. Lysosomes function in digestion of substances that enter the cell by endocytosis, and\r\ntransport the final products of digestion into the cytosol.\r\nc. They digest worn-out organelles (autophagy).\r\nd. They digest their own cellular contents (autolysis).\r\ne. They carry out extracellular digestion (as happens when sperm release lysosomal\r\nenzymes to aid in penetrating an oocyte).\r\n6. Vacuoles.\r\na. Space in the cytoplasm enclosed by a membrane called a tonoplast.\r\nb. Derived from the Golgi complex.\r\nc. They serve in the following ways:\r\ni. Temporary storage for biological molecules and ions.\r\nii. Bring food into cells.\r\niii. Provide structural support.\r\niv. Store metabolic wastes.\r\n7. Peroxisomes.\r\na. Peroxisomes are similar in structure to lysosomes, but are smaller.\r\nb. They contain enzymes (oxidases) that use molecular oxygen to oxidize (remove\r\nhydrogen atoms from) various organic substances.\r\n13\r\nc. They take part in normal metabolic reactions such as the oxidation of amino and fatty\r\nacids.\r\nd. New peroxisomes form by budding off from preexisting ones.\r\ne. They produce and then destroy H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) in the process of their\r\nmetabolic activities.\r\n8. Centrosomes.\r\na. Centrosomes are dense areas of cytoplasm containing the centrioles, which are paired\r\ncylinders arranged at right angles to one another, and serve as centers for organizing\r\nmicrotubules and the mitotic spindle during mitosis.\r\n9. Mitochondria.\r\na. Found in nearly all eukaryotic cells.\r\nb. A mitochondrion is bound by a double membrane, with a fluid-filled space between\r\ncalled the intermembranous space. The outer membrane is smooth, while the inner\r\nmembrane is arranged in folds called cristae. The mitochondrial matrix is found inside the\r\ninner mitochondrial membrane.\r\nc. The folds of the cristae provide a large surface area for the chemical reactions that are\r\npart of the aerobic phase of cellular respiration. These reactions produce most of a\r\neukaryotic cell\u2019s ATP, and the enzymes that catalyze them are located on the cristae and\r\nin the matrix.\r\nd. Mitochondria self-replicate using their own DNA and contain 70S ribosomes. They\r\ngrow and reproduce on their own in a way that is similar to binary fission. Mitochondrial\r\nDNA (genes) is inherited only from the mother, since sperm normally lack most organelles\r\nsuch as mitochondria, ribosomes, ER, and the Golgi complex. Any sperm mitochondria\r\nthat do enter the oocyte are soon destroyed.\r\n10. Chloroplasts.\r\na. Found only in algae and green plants.\r\nb. Contain the pigment chlorophyll and enzymes necessary for photosynthesis.\r\nc. Chloroplasts self-replicate using their own DNA and contain 70S ribosomes. They grow\r\nand reproduce on their own in a way that is similar to binary fission.\r\nVII. Endosymbiotic Theory.\r\na. Large bacterial cells lost their cell walls and engulfed smaller bacteria.\r\nb. A symbiotic (mutualistic) relationship developed.\r\ni. The host cell supplied the nutrients.\r\nii. The engulfed cell produced excess energy that the host could use.\r\niii. The relationship evolved.\r\nc. Evidence:\r\n14\r\ni. Mitochondria and chloroplasts resemble bacteria in size and shape.\r\n1. They divide on their own\u2014independently of the host, and contain their own DNA\r\n(single circular chromosome). This process is nearly identical to binary fission seen in\r\nbacteria.\r\n2. They contain 70S ribosomes.\r\n3. Their method of protein synthesis is more like that of prokaryotes (no RNA processing).\r\n4. Antibiotics that inhibit protein synthesis on ribosomes in bacteria also inhibit protein\r\nDifference among eukaryotic cells\r\nThere are many different types of eukaryotic cells, though animals and plants are the most\r\nfamiliar eukaryotes, and thus provide an excellent starting point for understanding\r\neukaryotic structure. Fungi and many protists have some substantial differences, however.\r\nAnimal cell\r\nAn animal cell is a form of eukaryotic cell that makes up many tissues in animals. Animal\r\ncells are distinct from other eukaryotes, most notably plant cells, as they lack cell walls and\r\nchloroplasts. They also have smaller vacuoles. Due to the lack of a cell wall, animal cells\r\ncan adopt a variety of shapes. A phagocytic cell can even engulf other structures.\r\nThere are many different types of cell. For instance, there are approximately 210 distinct\r\ncell types in the adult human body.\r\nPlant cell\r\nPlant cells are quite different from the cells of the other eukaryotic organisms. Their\r\ndistinctive features are:\r\nA large central vacuole (enclosed by a membrane, the tonoplast), which maintains the cell's\r\nturgor and controls movement ofmolecules between the cytosol and sap\r\nA primary cell wall containing cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin, deposited by the\r\nprotoplast on the outside of the cell membrane; this contrasts with the cell walls of fungi, which\r\ncontain chitin, and the cell envelopes of prokaryotes, in which peptidoglycans are the main\r\nstructural molecules\r\nThe plasmodesmata, linking pores in the cell wall that allow each plant cell to communicate\r\nwith other adjacent cells; this is different from the functionally analogous system of gap\r\njunctions between animal cells.\r\n15\r\nPlastids, especially chloroplasts that contain chlorophyll, the pigment that gives\r\nplants their green color and allows them to perform photosynthesis\r\nBryophytes and seedless vascular plants lack flagellae and centrioles except in the sperm\r\ncells.[16] Sperm of cycads and Ginkgoare large, complex cells that swim with hundreds to\r\nthousands of flagellae.\r\nConifers (Pinophyta)\r\n and flowering\r\n plants (Angiospermae)\r\n lack\r\nthe flagellae and centrioles that are present in animal cells.\r\n\r\n"}
{"system_instruction": "Formulate your answer using only the provided text; do not draw from any outside sources.", "user_request": "What is HR 4319?", "context_document": "Background on the 2024 Farmworker Protection Rule\nDOL indicates that the purpose of the Farmworker Protection Rule is to strengthen \u201cprotections for\nagricultural workers,\u201d enhance the agency\u2019s \u201ccapabilities to monitor H-2A program compliance and take\nnecessary enforcement actions against program violators,\u201d and ensure that \u201chiring H-2A workers does not\nadversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed workers\u201d in the United States.\nThe rule amends existing regulations and includes provisions that encompass six areas: (1) \u201cprotections\nfor worker voice and empowerment,\u201d (2) \u201cclarification of termination for cause,\u201d (3) \u201cimmediate effective\ndate for updated adverse effect wage rate,\u201d (4) \u201cenhanced transparency for job opportunity and foreign\nlabor recruitment,\u201d (5) \u201cenhanced transparency and protections for agricultural workers,\u201d and (6)\n\u201cenhanced integrity and enforcement capabilities.\u201d\nIn the pending litigation, the first set of provisions, i.e., \u201cprotections for worker voice and empowerment\u201d\nis most relevant. This set revises 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 655.135(h) and adds two new subsections, (m) and (n). DOL\nhas stated that these provisions aim to protect H-2A workers by \u201cexplicitly protecting certain activities all\nworkers must be able to engage in without fear of intimidation, threats, and other forms of retaliation\u201d;\nsafeguarding \u201ccollective action and concerted activity for mutual aid and protection\u201d; allowing workers to\ndecline to listen to \u201cemployer speech regarding protected activities without fear of retaliation\u201d; permitting\nworkers to \u201cdesignate a representative of their choosing in certain interviews\u201d; and authorizing workers to\n\u201cinvite or accept guests to worker housing.\u201d The rule states that it \u201cdoes not require employers to\nrecognize labor organizations or to engage in any collective bargaining activities such as those that may\nbe required by the [National Labor Relations Act].\u201d The National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) is a law\nthat gives collective bargaining rights to workers who qualify as \u201cemployees\u201d under the definition in the\nstatute. The NLRA explicitly excludes agricultural workers from the definition of \u201cemployee.\u201d\nKansas v. U.S. Department of Labor\nOn June 10, 2024, Kansas and 16 other states, a trade association of growers, and a private farm filed a\ncomplaint against DOL in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, arguing, among\nother things, that the Farmworker Protection Rule violates the NLRA because it gives H-2A agricultural\nworkers collective bargaining rights when the NLRA explicitly excludes agricultural workers from having\nthose rights. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for a preliminary injunction and temporary\nrestraining order seeking a stay of the effective date of the Farmworker Protection Rule or, in the\nalternative, a temporary restraining order until the court grants an injunction. The court held a hearing on\nthe motion on August 2, 2024, and on August 26, 2024, the federal district court judge granted the\nplaintiffs\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction.\nPlaintiffs\u2019 Arguments\nThe arguments below were raised in the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction. This Sidebar does\nnot cover every argument the plaintiffs advanced.\nThe Rule Violates the NLRA\nThe plaintiffs argued that the rule is not in accordance with existing law and that DOL is providing\ncollective bargaining protection to H-2A workers. According to the plaintiffs, parts of the rule are almost\na direct copy of certain provisions in the NLRA, such as those regarding unfair labor practices and\nrepresentatives and elections. The plaintiffs acknowledged that the rule does not expressly declare that H2A workers have a right to unionize and collectively bargain, but they claim that the protections conferred\nby the rule effectively confer such rights in contravention of the NLRA.\nThe Rule Exceeds DOL\u2019s Authority Under the INA\nThe plaintiffs also argued that DOL has very limited authority to issue regulations under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1188.\nSpecifically, the plaintiffs state that Section 1188(a), which is the part of the statute DOL relied on to\npromulgate the rule, is being misinterpreted by the agency. According to the plaintiffs, DOL is supposed\nto neutralize any adverse effects from an influx of H-2A workers and not necessarily take affirmative\nsteps to improve the working conditions for H-2A workers. In addition, according to the plaintiffs,\nSection 1188(a) does not explicitly give DOL rulemaking authority.\nThe plaintiffs filed this lawsuit before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Loper Bright Enterprises v.\nRaimondo, which overturned the Chevron doctrine. The Chevron doctrine directed courts to defer to an\nagency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of ambiguous statutes the agency administers. The plaintiffs argued\nthat because Congress\u2019s intent was clear in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1188, DOL was not entitled to Chevron deference.\nRelatedly, the plaintiffs pointed out that DOL relies on caselaw that existed before the Supreme Court\noverruled the Chevron doctrine rather than on the statute itself.\nDOL\u2019s Arguments\nThe arguments below were raised in DOL\u2019s response to the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for preliminary injunction.\nThis Sidebar does not cover every argument DOL advanced.\nThe Rule Does Not Violate the NLRA\nIn summary, DOL argued that the rule does not require employers to recognize unions or engage in\ncollective bargaining and is therefore not in violation of the NLRA. According to DOL, the rule expands\non existing H-2A anti-discrimination provisions, and individuals who fall outside the NLRA\u2019s definition\nof \u201cemployee\u201d can still be protected by other statutes and regulations. DOL states that the rule does just\nthat by granting protections to those not covered by the NLRA. Finally, DOL argues that the rule and the\nNLRA do not conflict with one another.\nThe Rule Is a Proper Exercise of DOL\u2019s Statutory Obligation\nDOL responded to the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the rule exceeded its authority by stating that the INA\ngrants it rulemaking authority. DOL pointed out that provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1188 expressly reference\nDOL regulations and that Congress authorized it to implement the mission of the statute through\nregulation. Further, DOL argued that H-2A workers will become more attractive to U.S. employers if they\nreceive fewer protections than U.S. workers and that this in turn will \u201cadversely affect\u201d U.S. workers. The\ngoal of the rule, according to DOL, is to place H-2A workers on similar footing as U.S. workers to prevent an adverse effect in the long run. Lastly, DOL maintained that it has historically understood the\n\u201cadverse effect\u201d requirement \u201cas requiring parity between the terms and conditions of employment\nprovided to H-2A workers ... and as establishing a baseline \u2018acceptable\u2019 standard for working conditions\nbelow which [U.S. workers] would be adversely affected.\u201d\nDOL filed its response after the Supreme Court announced the overruling of Chevron in Loper Bright\nEnterprises. Citing Loper Bright Enterprises in a footnote, DOL argued that the best reading of Section\n1188 was that Congress had delegated to DOL broad, discretionary authority to take action to prevent\nadverse effects to workers in the United States. The agency claimed that the rule is an appropriate\nexercise of this discretionary authority, including because the rule \u201censures that agricultural employers\ncannot use the H-2A workforce to undermine workers in the United States who seek better wages and\nworking conditions.\u201d", "full_prompt": "Formulate your answer using only the provided text; do not draw from any outside sources.\n\nProvided text:\nThe Court\u2019s Order on the Motion for Preliminary Injunction\nOn August 26, 2024, a federal district court judge granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for preliminary\ninjunction. The judge found that the plaintiffs met their burden to show that they were entitled to\npreliminary relief. First, the judge held that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their\ncase. The judge initially determined that the rule falls within DOL\u2019s rulemaking authority under 8 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1188 but found that the rule conflicts with the NLRA. Specifically, the judge stated that DOL had \u201cnot\nshown a consequential difference between the rights protected by the [rule] and those given to\nnonagricultural workers by the NLRA,\u201d that the rule \u201ccreates a right not previously bestowed by\nCongress,\u201d and that DOL failed to show that Congress intended to give agricultural workers a right to\nparticipate in collective bargaining. The judge further found that just because DOL has rulemaking\nauthority does not mean it can \u201ccreate law or protect newly-created rights of agricultural workers.\u201d\nTherefore, the court held that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim. The judge\nfurther held that the plaintiffs met their burden with regard to the other factors needed to support a\npreliminary injunction.\nThe judge also found that, although the plaintiffs were entitled to preliminary relief, that relief should be\nnarrowly tailored and party-specific. According to the court, nationwide relief is generally disfavored, as\n\u201cnational uniformity is not a proper consideration,\u201d and a nationwide injunction in this case is\nunwarranted. The judge determined that the court is able to provide a tailored preliminary injunction that\naddresses the plaintiffs\u2019 harms and can offer relief \u201cwithout issuing a nationwide injunction.\u201d DOL filed a\nmotion for reconsideration of the scope of the judge\u2019s order, but the motion was denied.\nConsiderations for Congress\nMembers of Congress have taken differing views on the Farmworker Protection Rule. Before the rule was\nfinalized, several Members of Congress wrote a letter in November 2023 to Acting DOL Secretary Su and\nDHS Secretary Mayorkas in support of the rule, stating that the rule represents an opportunity to improve\nworking conditions for H-2A workers and \u201cimprove enforcement capabilities of agencies against abusive\nemployers.\u201d Following the rule\u2019s publication in April 2024, Representative Scott Franklin introduced a\nresolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to rescind the rule, H.J. Res. 135. This\nresolution would prohibit DOL from any future similar rulemaking. He and the co-sponsors maintain that\nthe rule will increase costs for agricultural producers and allow H-2A workers to unionize.\nThere are other options if Congress chooses to respond to DOL\u2019s Farmworker Protection Rule. First,\nCongress may consider amending the NLRA\u2019s definition of \u201cemployee\u201d to include agricultural workers,\nthereby allowing H-2A agricultural workers to receive collective bargaining rights. Alternatively,\nCongress could amend the NLRA and other laws to authorize or prohibit different labor requirements\ncontained in the Farmworker Protection Rule that are not expressly addressed under existing statutes.\nCongress could also consider making changes to the H-2A visa program itself. For example, the\nAffordable and Secure Food Act (S. 4069) in the 118th Congress would, among other things, reform the\nH-2A visa program by adding worker protections and by providing visas for year-round jobs. A similar\nbill, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2023 (H.R. 4319), has been introduced in the House\nduring this Congress. Earlier versions of this bill introduced in the 116th and 117th Congresses passed the\nHouse.\n\nWhat is HR 4319?"}

PROBLEMS WITH SALARY ARBITRATION\n \n\n The requirements laid out by the collective bargaining agreement still leave much room for problems between the players and the teams. The first problem stems from the final offer or high/low format of arbitration procedure. In requiring the arbitrator to chose one amount or the other makes the final offer format unique. The arbitrator cannot reach a compromise between the two parties' offers.

According to the CBA criteria for salary arbitration, a team can essentially introduce evidence that may degrade a player and his accomplishments in the arbitration hearings. However, since the player will likely be returning to the same team the following year, the team may tend to hold back sensitive information which may offend the player. An arbitrator from a prominent New York law firm that handles some of the arbitration proceedings for the New York Yankees stated in a phone conversation on March 4, 2002, that most teams tend to hold back degrading and malicious information about some of their players because they are afraid of the repercussions in the following year.

If this information is negative, it will not be a comfortable situation for that player if he remains with the team during the following season.\n \n\n Some teams are afraid of introducing the degrading and detrimental evidence of a player and his conduct to prevent the player from being offended and taking those feelings of betrayal with him\n to the field the following season. The arbitrator gave an example of a player being affected by an arbitration hearing in the National Hockey League (\"NHL\"). The case involved the owner of the\n New York Islanders who went into a salary arbitration hearing with their then goalie.

The goalie felt so\n  betrayed by his team and the whole process, he refused to return to the Islanders the following season.

The fast fashion business model relies on the exploitation of resources\r\nand human labor to deliver garments following the latest trends to its consumers at\r\nan unprecedented rate. This quick output of garments demands a sizeable volume of\r\nraw materials fed into the fast fashion industry, creating a significant amount of waste,\r\npollution and degradation to air, water and wildlife habitat. The pollution introduced\r\nby the fast fashion industry results in devastating impacts to both terrestrial and\r\naquatic environments, with harmful effects linked to habitat degradation, proliferation\r\nof chemicals and microplastics in waterways, and the increasing impact of climate\r\nchange from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.\r\nDespite the increased demand and consumption of fast fashion garments and\r\npeople\u2019s apparent growing interest in fashion, they are buying more while wearing\r\nfewer of the items they own. The poor quality of fast fashion clothing contributes to\r\nthe limited lifespans of garments, which often end up decomposing slowly in landfills\r\nor being incinerated. In addition to degrading in landfills or being incinerated, fast\r\nfashion clothing has also become a notorious source of microplastics in marine\r\nenvironments as the cheap, plastic-based materials shed fibers that make their way to\r\nthe oceans.\r\nOn top of the environmental exploitation that allows for fast fashion\u2019s cheap prices,\r\nthe other contributing factor is worker exploitation in low-income countries where\r\nfactories are based. Workers \u2014 primarily young women \u2014 are subjected to hazardous\r\nworking conditions while earning unlivable wages, despite the companies pulling in\r\nmassive profits.\r\nAlthough both the fashion industry and consumers have indicated that sustainability\r\nis a priority, fast fashion is an increasingly unsustainable market that continues to\r\ngrow, relatively unchecked. And the scale of this industry is enormous: For a company\r\nsuch as Shein, an estimated 1,000 new styles are uploaded daily \u2014 though there has\r\nbeen speculation that this figure may be a gross underestimate (Zhou, 2022). With the\r\naverage number of each garment manufactured ranging from 50-100, according to\r\nthe Shein website, this results in a minimum of 50,000 new garments created every\r\nday.\r\nChanging these practices requires drawing attention to the harms of fast fashion and\r\nshifting the narrative from the glamour that has been assigned to overconsumption\r\ntoward fashion that embraces sustainability and justice.\r\nAT WHAT COST? 4\r\nBehind the glamour of the fashion industry hides a steep environmental price. The\r\nfashion industry as a whole is responsible for consuming 79 trillion liters of water per\r\nyear, producing over 92 million tons of solid waste per year, and contributing up to an\r\nestimated 20% of global wastewater and 10% of CO2 emissions (Niinimaki et al., 2020;\r\nUN Climate Change, 2018).\r\nThis output of CO2 exceeds that of the international aviation and shipping industries\r\ncombined (UN Climate Change, 2018). Concern continues to rise as, over a span of\r\nroughly 20 years, the number of new garments made per year has nearly doubled and\r\nglobal consumption of fashion has increased by 400% (World Bank, 2019; Collective\r\nFashion Justice). If this trend continues, industry greenhouse gas emissions could also\r\nincrease significantly, possibly by over 50% by the year 2030 (World Bank, 2019). One of\r\nthe most notorious sectors driving these harms has also become one of the fastest\r\ngrowing: the fast fashion industry.\r\nFast fashion is an exploitative, growing industry based on the replication and mass\r\nproduction of garments following current trends \u2014 a business model that has\r\nrevolutionized the industry, simplifying consumers\u2019 purchasing process and\r\nexpediting the turnover of both garments and trends.\r\nThis transformation, however, comes at a price. Every day fast fashion companies are\r\ncapable of producing a shocking 10,000 new garment styles (Williams, 2022). These\r\nitems are produced quickly and with an excess of waste: As much as 15% of the fabric\r\nused during manufacturing is discarded during the garment production process\r\n(Shukla, 2022). Unethical generation of waste has become a pivotal element of\r\ntransforming the fashion industry into the polluting behemoth it is today.\r\nIn addition to the waste produced during quick manufacturing, businesses are\r\ngenerating yet more pollution to protect their business models (Lieber, 2018). Brands\r\nat all levels, from Shein to Nike to Burberry, have been found to destroy new,\r\nundamaged products (Mayo, 2021). This has often been carried out by burning, which\r\nintroduces additional CO2 and toxic gases on top of the industry\u2019s already large\r\ncontribution. For companies like Shein, production costs are so low that returned\r\nitems are often destined for landfills because it costs less to simply dispose of items\r\nthan put them back into circulation (Williams, 2022).\r\nThe low costs set by the fast fashion industry have been praised by some for making\r\nnew clothing more accessible to people with lower incomes, yet the largest\r\nconsumers of fast fashion include customers of relatively substantial income, while\r\nlow-income communities bear the brunt of the industry\u2019s waste and pollution. This\r\nfurther demonstrates that the goal of this industry is not inclusivity but enormous\r\nAT WHAT COST? 5\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nprofit based on environmental and worker exploitation (Williams, 2022). Fast fashion\r\nhas changed society\u2019s perception of what clothing is worth. The enticing low costs in\r\nfast fashion push poorly made garments on people, promoting excess purchasing of\r\ncheap items destined for the landfill rather than the purchasing of higher-quality\r\ngarments that will ultimately last longer\r\n\r\nClothing production adversely affects the environment at every stage. Land is cleared\r\nor degraded to produce fossil fuels for fibers, raise animals, or grow commodity crops.\r\nToxic chemicals are used in processing. Greenhouse gas emissions are produced in\r\nmanufacturing and transportation, and waste is generated by factories.\r\nPolyester, a synthetic material obtained from oil, is one of the most widely used fabrics\r\nin the fast fashion industry. It is also one of the most environmentally harmful fabrics.\r\nThis material alone was reported to consume 70 million barrels of oil in 2015; the\r\nproduction of all synthetic fibers uses approximately 342 million barrels of oil each\r\nyear (Conca, 2015; Ellen Macarthur Foundation and Circular Fibres Initiative, 2017).\r\nPetrochemicals, in fact, were estimated to be responsible for 62% of global textile\r\nfibers (Textile Exchange, 2021). The extraction of fossil fuels requires destroying\r\nwildlands to develop facilities and drilling sites, affecting the habitability of land and\r\ncausing habitat fragmentation, which disrupts essential animal behaviors (The\r\nWilderness Society, 2021). Producing synthetics also contributes greenhouse gases to\r\nthe atmosphere due to their origin in petrochemicals.\r\nFossil-fuel-based fabrics, however, are not the only materials of concern in the fast\r\nfashion industry. Producing animal-based textiles such as wool involves the breeding\r\nof farmed animals, which often results in widespread habitat loss from deforestation\r\nand grassland conversion to create the necessary room for grazing or to produce feed\r\n(McKinsey & Company 2020). Animal-based fibers used in fast fashion are also\r\nresponsible for a large portion of the industry\u2019s massive water consumption. Sheep\r\nbred for wool require significant amounts of water for hydration and feed crops that\r\nfrequently rely on additional, chemical-intensive processes (Center for Biological\r\nDiversity, 2021).\r\nThe wool industry degrades wildlife habitat, with sheep displacing native wildlife and\r\neating the vegetation they need. It also produces large amounts of wastewater,\r\nwith fecal waste polluting waterways and slaughterhouses expelling additional\r\nAT WHAT COST? 6\r\nwastewater. This water often contains contaminants including pathogens, proteins,\r\nfibers, and contamination from antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals (Center for\r\nBiological Diversity, 2021).\r\nSince 35% to 60% of the weight of shorn wool is contaminated with grease, dirt, feces,\r\nvegetable matter and other impurities, wool must go through a scouring process\r\nusing hot water and chemicals before it can be turned into a usable fiber. A typical\r\nwool scour creates an effluent load similar to the sewage from a town of 30,000\r\npeople (Center for Biological Diversity, 2021). A more detailed accounting of the full\r\nscope of environmental harms of animal-based textiles such as wool can be found in\r\nShear Destruction: Wool, Fashion and the Biodiversity Crisis (Center for Biological\r\nDiversity).\r\nCotton is one of the most widely used materials worldwide due to its versatility and\r\neasy care. But despite only occupying 2.4% of the world\u2019s cropland, cotton uses\r\ntremendous amounts of pesticides; it is responsible for roughly one-fifth of global\r\ninsecticide use (McKinsey & Company 2020). This results in serious harm to nontarget\r\ninsects such as endangered rusty patched bumble bees and monarch butterflies. On\r\ntop of its enormous pesticide use, conventional cotton, which accounts for most\r\ncotton grown, requires a significant amount of water during the growing process. The\r\ncotton used in a single pair of denim jeans requires roughly 10,000 liters of water, an\r\namount equal to what the average person would drink over the course of ten years\r\n(UN Climate Change, 2018). And the water that runs off cotton fields carries a heavy\r\npesticide load.\r\nUnlike conventional cotton, organic cotton is not produced with synthetic pesticides.\r\nIt\u2019s also estimated that organic cotton production uses 91% less water than\r\nconventional cotton, in large part because genetically engineered crops generally\r\nrequire more water (Chan, 2019). Organic cotton, however, is seldom used over\r\nconventional cotton in fast fashion due to the heightened costs associated with\r\nproduction.\r\nEven fibers associated with fewer environmental harms than those reliant on oil\r\nproduction and animal agriculture can cause severe damage when produced\r\nirresponsibly and at scale to meet the demands of fast fashion. More than 150 million\r\ntrees are cut down annually to produce man-made cellulose fibers (Canopy, 2020). Of\r\nthe man-made cellulose fibers produced, up to an estimated 30% originate from\r\nprimary or endangered forests (McCullough, 2014). Additional habitat loss can result\r\nfrom the soil degradation or pollution of waterways from chemicals used in\r\nprocessing or at plantations (McKinsey & Company 2020).\r\nFast fashion also requires a significant amount of water at the factory level, which\r\nresults in roughly 93 billion cubic meters of wastewater just from textile dyeing (Lai,\r\n2021). In low-income countries that produce a large portion of the world\u2019s fast\r\nfashion, such as Bangladesh, the toxic wastewater from textile factories has\r\nhistorically been dumped directly into rivers or streams to reduce production costs\r\n(Regan, 2020). This action has resulted in bodies of water changing colors from the\r\nAT WHAT COST? 7\r\ndye used or turning black and thick with sludge (Regan, 2020).\r\nThis polluted water introduces harms to both marine environments and humans. At\r\nleast 72 of the chemicals used in the dyeing process have been identified as toxic\r\n(World Bank, 2014). Once these chemicals accumulate in waterways, they begin to\r\nproduce a film on the surface, blocking the entrance of light and preventing\r\norganisms\u2019 abilities to photosynthesize (World Bank, 2014). Reduced ability to\r\nphotosynthesize results in lower oxygen levels, or hypoxia, in the water, impacting the\r\necosystem\u2019s survivability for aquatic plants and animals. In addition to increased\r\nprevalence of hypoxia in aquatic environments, the presence of certain chemicals\r\nused in the dyeing process can also increase the buildup of heavy metals (World Bank,\r\n2014).\r\nPolluted water is often used to irrigate crops and studies have found textile dyes\r\npresent in fruits and vegetables grown around Savar in Bangladesh (Sakamoto et al.,\r\n2019). Areas closer to industrial hubs are disproportionately impacted by the harms of\r\nfast fashion, with costs to livelihoods due to impacted agriculture or fishing, increased\r\nincidence of disease including jaundice or diarrhea, and decreased accessibility to safe\r\ndrinking water during the dry season, as contaminated surface water may be unable\r\nto be effectively treated (World Bank, 2014; Ullah et al., 2006).\r\nPesticides used in the growing of cotton and other crops have also been found to\r\nhave harmful effects on biodiversity. The textile industry is estimated to account for\r\nbetween 10-20% of global pesticide use (McKinsey & Company, 2021).\r\nOrganisms can be exposed to chemicals either directly through application or\r\nindirectly through runoff, contamination, or secondary poisoning (Beyond Pesticides).\r\nExposure to pesticides is linked to a wide array of health concerns in various species\r\nincluding birds, small mammals, insects, fish and humans. These health concerns\r\nconsist of reproductive effects, neurotoxicity, endocrine effects and liver and kidney\r\ndamage (Beyond Pesticides). Such harmful effects can occur after minimal exposure,\r\nas reproductive abnormalities have been observed in multiple species following \u201csafe\u201d\r\nlevels of exposure as classified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency\r\n(Beyond Pesticides).\r\nThe environmental impacts of fast fashion are not limited to the direct impacts from\r\nthe manufacturing process. Fast fashion churns out poorly made clothes with limited\r\nlifespans because of the low quality of materials used and the industry thriving off the\r\nconstant business from a quick turnover of garments. The quick turnover coupled\r\nwith poor quality resulted in 60% of the items manufactured in 2012 being discarded\r\nonly a few years after purchase (Shukla, 2022). One survey in Britain found that 1 in 3\r\nyoung women believed clothes to be \u201cold\u201d following as few as one or two wears\r\n(McKinsey & Company, 2018).\r\nOn average consumers are keeping purchased items about half as long as they did at\r\nthe turn of the 21st century and purchasing 60% more clothing per year (Remy et\r\nal., 2016). Based on this trend and the low prevalence of clothing recycling, over 50%\r\nAT WHAT COST? 8\r\nAT WHAT COST? 9\r\nof these garments end up in landfills (Shukla, 2022).\r\nIn 2018, 11.3 million tons of textiles entered landfills\r\nas municipal solid waste in the United States,\r\naveraging out to roughly 70 pounds of discarded\r\ngarments per person (EPA).\r\nEven for the clothing that continues to be worn and\r\nwashed, an environmental toll is paid. Synthetic\r\nfabrics release microfibers at alarming rates of\r\nroughly 700,000 fibers per load of laundry, which\r\noften end up in the ocean and other environments\r\n(Ocean Clean Wash, 2019). This adds up to\r\napproximately 500,000 tons of microfibers per year\r\nentering the ocean (Ellen MacArthur Foundation,\r\n2017). An IUCN report estimated that between\r\n15%-31% of plastic pollution in the ocean could\r\ncome from household or industrial products\r\nexpelling these microplastics, with 35% of that\r\nmicroplastic coming from the washing of synthetic\r\nfabrics (Boucher and Friot, 2017).\r\nFibers such as polyester are slow to degrade in the ocean, taking potentially up to 200\r\nyears to decompose, then producing toxic substances when they do that pose\r\ndangers for marine ecosystems (Brewer, 2019; Shukla, 2022). Microplastics pose the\r\nadditional danger of being consumed by marine organisms, then entering the food\r\nchain and being consumed eventually by humans. For marine organisms that\r\nconsume microplastics, impacts may include delayed growth, abnormal behavior, or\r\nreduced intake of food (Li et al., 2021). For humans, microplastics that have made their\r\nway up the food chain pose risks of allergic reactions or cell death (Parker, 2022).\r\nDespite the majority of fiber production being attributed to synthetic fabrics, a 2020\r\nstudy found that most microfibers were actually from cellulosic and plant-based\r\nfibers, followed by animal fibers (Suaria et al., 2020). While such natural fibers are often\r\nassumed to be biodegradable, modifications made during textile production often\r\ninclude alterations with chemicals, dyes, or coatings that in turn impact the\r\nbiodegradability of the material (Henry et al., 2019). Additional modifications that occur\r\nduring manufacturing are seen with wool, where natural fibers are often blended with\r\nsynthetics for fast fashion, impacting the biodegradability of the fabric (Center for\r\nBiological Diversity, 2021).\r\nAs much of the research on the biodegradability and risks of microfibers is new or still\r\ndeveloping, the problem of microfiber introduction from the fast fashion industry\r\ncannot yet be limited to the impacts from synthetics, as the full scope of risks of all\r\nmicrofibers is still being realized. This brings the issue of fast fashion back to the\r\nimmense scale of production, as there is not one specific fiber to blame for the\r\nenvironmental degradation but the business model as a whole.\r\nPhoto Source: Canva\r\nAT WHAT COST? 10\r\nThe introduction of chemicals to the environment is not the only harm associated\r\nwith the fast fashion industry. The harsh chemicals used in manufacturing create\r\npotential health hazards for workers and consumers. These risks can be felt in a wide\r\nrange of communities, as fast fashion garments are usually produced in low-income\r\ncountries but purchased in high-income countries.\r\nAt the beginning of the production process, pesticides can cause harm to workers as\r\nthey have been linked to acute and chronic health issues including reproductive\r\ndisorders, neurological disorders, respiratory conditions, certain cancers and death\r\n(Farmworker Justice, 2013). In garment factories, workers are exposed to occupational\r\nhazards including respiratory harms from chemicals and musculoskeletal harms from\r\nrepeated motions (Islam, 2022).\r\nThe harmful effects can even be experienced by the consumer of fast fashion.\r\nGarments contain a variety of harmful chemicals including PFAS, azo dyes, phthalates,\r\nand formaldehyde (Fashinnovation, 2022). These chemicals come with risks of\r\nirritation; respiratory, developmental, and reproductive problems; and certain cancers.\r\nOn top of that, the spillover of cheaply made fast fashion can also affect the\r\neconomies of low-income countries, even if they are not involved directly in the\r\nproduction of garments.\r\nEvery year the United States exports roughly 500,000 tons of secondhand clothing to\r\nlow- and middle-income countries that do not always possess the infrastructure to\r\nhandle it (Brooks, 2019). Reports from various African communities note how these\r\nimports can decimate local textile businesses, as they are unable to compete with the\r\ncompetitive costs of these used garments (Brooks, 2019). While this opens a new\r\nmarket for secondhand clothing, it increases reliance on foreign countries and\r\nsuppresses local industries, resulting in a loss of culture and traditional styles (Porter,\r\n2019).\r\nThe continuing desire around the world for these garments at low costs also\r\ncontributes to the ongoing injustice related to low wages and working conditions in\r\nthe low-income countries where most factories are based. In April 2013 the Rana Plaza\r\nbuilding in Dhaka, Bangladesh collapsed, resulting in more than 1,100 textile-worker\r\nfatalities and bringing to light the subpar conditions in which fast fashion industries\r\noperate. Between 2006 and 2012, more than 500 workers in Bangladesh garment\r\nfactories died in factory fires, usually due to faulty wiring (Thomas, 2018).\r\nFollowing these tragic events, the Accord on Fire and Building Safety was signed by\r\nvarious fast fashion companies, including American Eagle, H&M, and Inditex. This\r\nagreement resulted in 97,000 hazards being repaired in 1,600 factories, and 900\r\nfactories being shut down for not meeting compliance standards (Thomas, 2018).\r\nHARMS TO HUMANS\r\nFollowing the expiration of the Accord in 2018, the 2018 Transition Accord was signed\r\nto extend similar protections until 2021 (Clean Clothes Campaign). Most recently, the\r\nInternational Accord took effect in September 2021 (International Accord, 2021). This\r\nlegally binding agreement promises to ensure factory structural safety for 26 months\r\nby the brands that have signed, which can be found here.\r\nThough a small step toward remedying the worker injustices in the fast fashion\r\nindustry, these pacts have yet to address low wages or health hazards associated with\r\nthis type of factory work. Beyond historical structure-related tragedies, textile workers\r\nare exposed to various occupational hazards, including respiratory and\r\nmusculoskeletal harms (Islam, 2022). Reported health conditions that have been\r\ndocumented include endocrine damage and reproductive harms, along with\r\naccidental injuries and death (Sant\u2019Ana and Kovalechen, 2012).\r\nThese effects are spread disproportionately across genders, as most workers in these\r\nfactories are young women (Thomas, 2018). An estimated 80% of global workers in the\r\ngarment industry are women, and despite this workplace majority, discrimination,\r\ngender pay gaps, and sexual harassment continue to be reported (Baptist World Aid\r\nAustralia, 2019).\r\nWhile many companies have \u2014 or are working to establish \u2014 systems to remedy this,\r\ninequalities continue to exist in many of these garment manufacturing environments\r\n(Baptist World Aid Australia, 2019). A reported 9 out of 10 garment workers in\r\nBangladesh are paid so unfairly for their labor that they cannot afford food for\r\nthemselves or their families (Oxfam). Yet to provide workers with a livable wage would\r\ncost some companies as little as an estimated 1% of the retail price of garments\r\n(Oxfam).\r\nThe gross injustices occurring within the fast fashion industry stand against the\r\nnarrative that fast fashion benefits low-income people. Rather, it exploits workers and\r\nconsumers alike.\r\nAT WHAT COST? 11\r\nPhoto Source: Rio Lecatompessy - Unsplash\r\nDespite the various claims made by companies showcasing their sustainable efforts\r\nthrough partial recycling or \u201cconscious\u201d collections, overall efforts are still relatively\r\nlow. Even the actions of companies that are following through on their pledges to be\r\nmore sustainable are not necessarily having a significant positive impact.\r\nOne of the most common recycled materials to substitute the creation of new\r\nsynthetics are polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. In a survey of roughly 50\r\nfashion brands, 85% claimed that they were working toward using recycled polyester\r\nsourced from plastic bottles (Circular). Using recycled polyester has the potential\r\nimpact of reducing carbon emissions by 32% (Federal Office for the Environment,\r\n2017). But while recycling sounds green in theory, there are several logistical\r\ndrawbacks.\r\nRecycling synthetic materials does not fix the emerging problem of microplastics, as\r\nrecycled materials will expel just as many fibers as new materials (Bryce, 2021).\r\nAdditionally, removing plastic bottles from their established, closed-loop system may\r\nactually harm their overall recyclable potential. These bottles can be recycled at least\r\n10 times in the current system. Feeding them into the fashion industry decreases\r\ntheir likelihood and potential to be recycled as most garments end up in landfills\r\n(Bryce, 2021). Despite the potential that exists with recycling plastic bottles, the\r\nactual rate at which PET bottles are recycled remains relatively low, with only 29.1%\r\nbeing recycled in 2018 (EPA). Textile recycling involves a similar shortcoming, as it\u2019s\r\nestimated that less than 1% of textile waste is recycled into new fibers due to\r\nlogistical issues including the collecting, sorting, and processing of garments\r\n(McKinsey & Company, 2022).\r\nMany claims made by fast fashion companies hint at sustainability but fall short, and\r\na lack of transparency contributes to the problem of greenwashing. Greenwashing is\r\ninfamous in the fast fashion industry, and multiple companies having had attention\r\ndrawn to their misleading claims in the past. Companies like Boohoo, SHEIN, H&M,\r\nASOS, and Zara have all released claims on their efforts to improve their\r\nsustainability, but there\u2019s little evidence they are realizing those claims (Rauturier,\r\n2022; Igini, 2022).\r\nThe popular brand H&M released environmental scorecards informing consumers\r\nabout how environmentally friendly their garments were. In an investigation by\r\nQuartz, more than half of the scorecards claimed pieces to be more\r\nenvironmentally friendly than they actually were, and in some instances the\r\nstatements were described as being \u201cthe exact opposite of reality\u201d (Quartz, 2022).\r\nThe garments included in the controversial claims were those labeled as\r\n\u201cConscious Choice.\u201d This specific label was described by H&M to mean \u201cpieces\r\nAT WHAT COST? 12\r\nGREENWASHING\r\n\r\nWhile many companies have environmentally harmful business models, there are\r\nothers that are taking a more meaningful approach to sustainability. These companies\r\nare actively encouraging people to extend the life of their clothing, providing\r\ncustomers with the resources to do so, and using data to back up their sustainability\r\nclaims. These claims have been published by the companies and their accuracies have\r\nnot been evaluated by this report.\r\nLevi\u2019s, for example, urges customers to wash their jeans less: after about 10 wears. This\r\nnot only lengthens the lifespan of jeans but saves water from washing machines and\r\nreduces the expelling of microfibers in the wash. Data published on Levi\u2019s website\r\nstates that taking care of your jeans and wearing them for 10 months or longer will\r\nreduce their carbon footprint by 18% and water footprint by 23%.\r\nLevi\u2019s also offers solutions for old or damaged clothing, like opening Levi\u2019s Tailor Shops\r\nwhere clothes can be altered or repaired, offering tutorials on how to perform various\r\nDIY projects on jeans, and suggesting that you donate unwanted clothing to\r\nsecondhand shops or pass items along as hand-me-downs.\r\nOther ways that brands are trying to lessen the waste in fashion is through product\r\nguarantees and resale initiatives. Patagonia includes a guarantee that if clothing\r\ndevelops damage due to wear, the company will repair it at a \u201creasonable charge.\u201d\r\nLike Levi\u2019s, Patagonia offers DIY repair guides to extend the life of products. It also\r\nhosts Worn Wear, a site where you can trade in used clothing so it can be washed and\r\nresold, lengthening the garment\u2019s lifespan. As an incentive, trading in a garment will\r\nget you credit that can be used to purchase new or used from the brand. Worn Wear\r\nalso has the additional bonus that the used articles are sold at a reduced cost\r\ncompared to new items. This increases accessibility of quality, long-lasting products to\r\nindividuals who might not be able to afford them otherwise and resort to fast fashion\r\nfor financial reasons.\r\nA PUSH TOWARD SUSTAINABILITY\r\nAT WHAT COST? 13\r\ncreated with a little extra consideration for the planet,\u201d with products containing at\r\nleast 50% of \u201cmore sustainable materials\u201d (H&M).

But simultaneously\r\nproducing and promoting the purchase of billions of garments per year, many of\r\nwhich get discarded and replaced quickly, reduces the potential positive impacts of\r\nso-called \u201cconscious collections\u201d and falsely reassures consumers.\r\nA different approach can be seen with MUD Jeans, which in 2013 introduced a\r\nprogram called Lease a Jeans, where customers can pay a monthly fee to lease jeans\r\nfor a year, after which the payments stop and the customer can either keep the jeans\r\nor return them to be recycled. In 2021, 11,512 pairs of jeans were recycled, with a\r\ndonation to plant one tree with the nonprofit Justdiggit with every pair. By promoting\r\na circular economy through jeans recycling, MUD Jeans states, it\u2019s producing no\r\nadditional end-of-life waste for those articles and using 92% less water than the\r\naverage jeans.\r\nIn addition to creative solutions to extend the lifespans of garments and reduce waste,\r\nefforts are being made by some companies to use more sustainable materials and\r\nmanufacturing processes. For plant-based fibers like cotton, organic and recycled\r\nmaterials tend to be more sustainable than conventional and virgin materials,\r\nrespectively.\r\nTo grow cotton \u2014 one of the most commonly used fabrics in the world \u2014 a substantial\r\namount of pesticides are conventionally used. Certified organic cotton, especially\r\ngrown in countries like the United States that have strict organic standards, does not\r\ncontain the dangerous pesticide load of conventional cotton. And recycled cotton\r\ndoes not take any additional pesticides to produce, reduces water consumption, and\r\nprevents garments from being sent to landfills.\r\nFlax (linen) and hemp are two additional, versatile crops that can be used for textiles.\r\nBoth are relatively environmentally friendly alternatives as they require minimal water\r\nand are often grown with little to no pesticides. Hemp grows so densely that it can\r\nreduce competition, and it also naturally deters pests (Hymann, 2020). Linen uses less\r\nwater and fewer pesticides than conventional cotton and has the benefit that the\r\nplant it\u2019s derived from is typically used in its entirety, reducing overall waste during\r\nproduction (Newman, 2020). Linen\u2019s natural hues come in a variety of colors including\r\nivory, tan, and grays, reducing the amount of dyes necessary (Newman, 2020). When\r\nuntreated, linen is entirely biodegradable.\r\nIn a push for more sustainable options, new materials are being derived from various\r\ntypes of plants. Bananatex is a relatively new fabric made from Abac\u00e1 banana plants\r\nthat is fully biodegradable and circular. This plant has many environmental\r\nadvantages, including that it does not require the use of pesticides, fertilizers, or\r\nadditional water (Bananatex). These characteristics have helped to contribute to\r\nreforestation in certain areas, strengthening biodiversity (Bananatex).\r\nOn top of using more sustainable fabrics, environmentally conscientious companies\r\nare taking additional steps to reduce waste in their supply chains. Efforts include\r\nusing recycled, plastic-free, or compostable packaging, using less harmful chemicals,\r\nand getting energy from cleaner sources such as solar power. While there is room for\r\nadditional reform in the fashion industry, a few examples of brands working towards\r\nmore sustainable practices can be seen here.\r\nNecessary reform of the fast fashion industry must involve voices from all levels. This\r\nAT WHAT COST? 14\r\nincludes individuals pushing for change, governments enacting policies that can\r\noversee change, and companies committing to make the change. Fast fashion\r\ncompanies need to be held accountable for their destructive practices, including the\r\nwaste they produce and the worker injustice that their business models are built\r\naround. Companies\u2019 flimsy claims of future reform are no longer enough.\r\nPolicy efforts to improve the fashion industry have involved the health and safety of\r\ngarment workers, unfair wages, and transparency of environmental impacts. U.S.\r\npolicies of note include The Fashioning Accountability and Building Real Institutional\r\nChange (FABRIC) Act, The Fashion and Sustainability and Social Accountability Act,\r\nand the SWEAT Bill.\r\nThe FABRIC Act is a federal bill that was introduced in May 2022. This legislature would\r\nprotect nearly 100,000 American garment workers, improving working conditions and\r\nwages, revitalizing the U.S. garment industry and investing in domestic apparel\r\nproduction (The FABRIC Act).\r\nThe Fashion and Sustainability and Social Accountability Act was referred to the\r\nConsumer Protection Committee in early 2022 and requires fashion manufacturers\r\nand retail sellers to disclose environmental policies along with social due diligence\r\npolicies. This state bill would also establish a community benefit fund that would help\r\nimplement projects that directly benefit environmental justice communities (New\r\nYork Senate).\r\nThe SWEAT Bill passed assembly in March 2022. This state bill involves ensuring the\r\npayment of wages for work that was already performed. It also \u201ccreates a lien remedy\r\nfor all employees; provides grounds for attachment; relates to procedures where\r\nemployees may hold shareholders of non-publicly traded corporations personally\r\nliable for wage theft; relates to rights for victims of wage theft to hold the ten\r\nmembers with the largest ownership interests in a company personally liable for wage\r\ntheft\u201d (New York Senate).\r\nIf companies are required or incentivized to pursue more sustainable practices, the\r\nscale of destruction caused by the fashion industry could be significantly lessened.\r\nAdditional work that could help to reform the fashion industry includes making\r\nsustainable fashion more affordable, so people of limited means are not forced to buy\r\nfast fashion, along with making fast fashion companies internalize the environmental\r\ncosts of their production and waste.\r\n", "full_prompt": "Answer in 3-5 paragraphs and use ONLY the text provided. \n\nWhat are the hidden costs of fast fashion?\n\nFast fashion has revolutionized the fashion industry at a cost to the environment and\r\nhuman rights. The fast fashion business model relies on the exploitation of resources\r\nand human labor to deliver garments following the latest trends to its consumers at\r\nan unprecedented rate. This quick output of garments demands a sizeable volume of\r\nraw materials fed into the fast fashion industry, creating a significant amount of waste,\r\npollution and degradation to air, water and wildlife habitat. The pollution introduced\r\nby the fast fashion industry results in devastating impacts to both terrestrial and\r\naquatic environments, with harmful effects linked to habitat degradation, proliferation\r\nof chemicals and microplastics in waterways, and the increasing impact of climate\r\nchange from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions.\r\nDespite the increased demand and consumption of fast fashion garments and\r\npeople\u2019s apparent growing interest in fashion, they are buying more while wearing\r\nfewer of the items they own. The poor quality of fast fashion clothing contributes to\r\nthe limited lifespans of garments, which often end up decomposing slowly in landfills\r\nor being incinerated. In addition to degrading in landfills or being incinerated, fast\r\nfashion clothing has also become a notorious source of microplastics in marine\r\nenvironments as the cheap, plastic-based materials shed fibers that make their way to\r\nthe oceans.\r\nOn top of the environmental exploitation that allows for fast fashion\u2019s cheap prices,\r\nthe other contributing factor is worker exploitation in low-income countries where\r\nfactories are based. Workers \u2014 primarily young women \u2014 are subjected to hazardous\r\nworking conditions while earning unlivable wages, despite the companies pulling in\r\nmassive profits.\r\nAlthough both the fashion industry and consumers have indicated that sustainability\r\nis a priority, fast fashion is an increasingly unsustainable market that continues to\r\ngrow, relatively unchecked. And the scale of this industry is enormous: For a company\r\nsuch as Shein, an estimated 1,000 new styles are uploaded daily \u2014 though there has\r\nbeen speculation that this figure may be a gross underestimate (Zhou, 2022). With the\r\naverage number of each garment manufactured ranging from 50-100, according to\r\nthe Shein website, this results in a minimum of 50,000 new garments created every\r\nday.\r\nChanging these practices requires drawing attention to the harms of fast fashion and\r\nshifting the narrative from the glamour that has been assigned to overconsumption\r\ntoward fashion that embraces sustainability and justice.\r\nAT WHAT COST? 4\r\nBehind the glamour of the fashion industry hides a steep environmental price. The\r\nfashion industry as a whole is responsible for consuming 79 trillion liters of water per\r\nyear, producing over 92 million tons of solid waste per year, and contributing up to an\r\nestimated 20% of global wastewater and 10% of CO2 emissions (Niinimaki et al., 2020;\r\nUN Climate Change, 2018).\r\nThis output of CO2 exceeds that of the international aviation and shipping industries\r\ncombined (UN Climate Change, 2018). Concern continues to rise as, over a span of\r\nroughly 20 years, the number of new garments made per year has nearly doubled and\r\nglobal consumption of fashion has increased by 400% (World Bank, 2019; Collective\r\nFashion Justice). If this trend continues, industry greenhouse gas emissions could also\r\nincrease significantly, possibly by over 50% by the year 2030 (World Bank, 2019). One of\r\nthe most notorious sectors driving these harms has also become one of the fastest\r\ngrowing: the fast fashion industry.\r\nFast fashion is an exploitative, growing industry based on the replication and mass\r\nproduction of garments following current trends \u2014 a business model that has\r\nrevolutionized the industry, simplifying consumers\u2019 purchasing process and\r\nexpediting the turnover of both garments and trends.\r\nThis transformation, however, comes at a price. Every day fast fashion companies are\r\ncapable of producing a shocking 10,000 new garment styles (Williams, 2022). These\r\nitems are produced quickly and with an excess of waste: As much as 15% of the fabric\r\nused during manufacturing is discarded during the garment production process\r\n(Shukla, 2022). Unethical generation of waste has become a pivotal element of\r\ntransforming the fashion industry into the polluting behemoth it is today.\r\nIn addition to the waste produced during quick manufacturing, businesses are\r\ngenerating yet more pollution to protect their business models (Lieber, 2018). Brands\r\nat all levels, from Shein to Nike to Burberry, have been found to destroy new,\r\nundamaged products (Mayo, 2021). This has often been carried out by burning, which\r\nintroduces additional CO2 and toxic gases on top of the industry\u2019s already large\r\ncontribution. For companies like Shein, production costs are so low that returned\r\nitems are often destined for landfills because it costs less to simply dispose of items\r\nthan put them back into circulation (Williams, 2022).\r\nThe low costs set by the fast fashion industry have been praised by some for making\r\nnew clothing more accessible to people with lower incomes, yet the largest\r\nconsumers of fast fashion include customers of relatively substantial income, while\r\nlow-income communities bear the brunt of the industry\u2019s waste and pollution. This\r\nfurther demonstrates that the goal of this industry is not inclusivity but enormous\r\nAT WHAT COST? 5\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nprofit based on environmental and worker exploitation (Williams, 2022). Fast fashion\r\nhas changed society\u2019s perception of what clothing is worth. The enticing low costs in\r\nfast fashion push poorly made garments on people, promoting excess purchasing of\r\ncheap items destined for the landfill rather than the purchasing of higher-quality\r\ngarments that will ultimately last longer\r\n\r\nClothing production adversely affects the environment at every stage. Land is cleared\r\nor degraded to produce fossil fuels for fibers, raise animals, or grow commodity crops.\r\nToxic chemicals are used in processing. Greenhouse gas emissions are produced in\r\nmanufacturing and transportation, and waste is generated by factories.\r\nPolyester, a synthetic material obtained from oil, is one of the most widely used fabrics\r\nin the fast fashion industry. It is also one of the most environmentally harmful fabrics.\r\nThis material alone was reported to consume 70 million barrels of oil in 2015; the\r\nproduction of all synthetic fibers uses approximately 342 million barrels of oil each\r\nyear (Conca, 2015; Ellen Macarthur Foundation and Circular Fibres Initiative, 2017).\r\nPetrochemicals, in fact, were estimated to be responsible for 62% of global textile\r\nfibers (Textile Exchange, 2021). The extraction of fossil fuels requires destroying\r\nwildlands to develop facilities and drilling sites, affecting the habitability of land and\r\ncausing habitat fragmentation, which disrupts essential animal behaviors (The\r\nWilderness Society, 2021). Producing synthetics also contributes greenhouse gases to\r\nthe atmosphere due to their origin in petrochemicals.\r\nFossil-fuel-based fabrics, however, are not the only materials of concern in the fast\r\nfashion industry. Producing animal-based textiles such as wool involves the breeding\r\nof farmed animals, which often results in widespread habitat loss from deforestation\r\nand grassland conversion to create the necessary room for grazing or to produce feed\r\n(McKinsey & Company 2020). Animal-based fibers used in fast fashion are also\r\nresponsible for a large portion of the industry\u2019s massive water consumption. Sheep\r\nbred for wool require significant amounts of water for hydration and feed crops that\r\nfrequently rely on additional, chemical-intensive processes (Center for Biological\r\nDiversity, 2021).\r\nThe wool industry degrades wildlife habitat, with sheep displacing native wildlife and\r\neating the vegetation they need. It also produces large amounts of wastewater,\r\nwith fecal waste polluting waterways and slaughterhouses expelling additional\r\nAT WHAT COST? 6\r\nwastewater. This water often contains contaminants including pathogens, proteins,\r\nfibers, and contamination from antibiotics and other pharmaceuticals (Center for\r\nBiological Diversity, 2021).\r\nSince 35% to 60% of the weight of shorn wool is contaminated with grease, dirt, feces,\r\nvegetable matter and other impurities, wool must go through a scouring process\r\nusing hot water and chemicals before it can be turned into a usable fiber. A typical\r\nwool scour creates an effluent load similar to the sewage from a town of 30,000\r\npeople (Center for Biological Diversity, 2021). A more detailed accounting of the full\r\nscope of environmental harms of animal-based textiles such as wool can be found in\r\nShear Destruction: Wool, Fashion and the Biodiversity Crisis (Center for Biological\r\nDiversity).\r\nCotton is one of the most widely used materials worldwide due to its versatility and\r\neasy care. But despite only occupying 2.4% of the world\u2019s cropland, cotton uses\r\ntremendous amounts of pesticides; it is responsible for roughly one-fifth of global\r\ninsecticide use (McKinsey & Company 2020). This results in serious harm to nontarget\r\ninsects such as endangered rusty patched bumble bees and monarch butterflies. On\r\ntop of its enormous pesticide use, conventional cotton, which accounts for most\r\ncotton grown, requires a significant amount of water during the growing process. The\r\ncotton used in a single pair of denim jeans requires roughly 10,000 liters of water, an\r\namount equal to what the average person would drink over the course of ten years\r\n(UN Climate Change, 2018). And the water that runs off cotton fields carries a heavy\r\npesticide load.\r\nUnlike conventional cotton, organic cotton is not produced with synthetic pesticides.\r\nIt\u2019s also estimated that organic cotton production uses 91% less water than\r\nconventional cotton, in large part because genetically engineered crops generally\r\nrequire more water (Chan, 2019). Organic cotton, however, is seldom used over\r\nconventional cotton in fast fashion due to the heightened costs associated with\r\nproduction.\r\nEven fibers associated with fewer environmental harms than those reliant on oil\r\nproduction and animal agriculture can cause severe damage when produced\r\nirresponsibly and at scale to meet the demands of fast fashion. More than 150 million\r\ntrees are cut down annually to produce man-made cellulose fibers (Canopy, 2020). Of\r\nthe man-made cellulose fibers produced, up to an estimated 30% originate from\r\nprimary or endangered forests (McCullough, 2014). Additional habitat loss can result\r\nfrom the soil degradation or pollution of waterways from chemicals used in\r\nprocessing or at plantations (McKinsey & Company 2020).\r\nFast fashion also requires a significant amount of water at the factory level, which\r\nresults in roughly 93 billion cubic meters of wastewater just from textile dyeing (Lai,\r\n2021). In low-income countries that produce a large portion of the world\u2019s fast\r\nfashion, such as Bangladesh, the toxic wastewater from textile factories has\r\nhistorically been dumped directly into rivers or streams to reduce production costs\r\n(Regan, 2020). This action has resulted in bodies of water changing colors from the\r\nAT WHAT COST? 7\r\ndye used or turning black and thick with sludge (Regan, 2020).\r\nThis polluted water introduces harms to both marine environments and humans. At\r\nleast 72 of the chemicals used in the dyeing process have been identified as toxic\r\n(World Bank, 2014). Once these chemicals accumulate in waterways, they begin to\r\nproduce a film on the surface, blocking the entrance of light and preventing\r\norganisms\u2019 abilities to photosynthesize (World Bank, 2014). Reduced ability to\r\nphotosynthesize results in lower oxygen levels, or hypoxia, in the water, impacting the\r\necosystem\u2019s survivability for aquatic plants and animals. In addition to increased\r\nprevalence of hypoxia in aquatic environments, the presence of certain chemicals\r\nused in the dyeing process can also increase the buildup of heavy metals (World Bank,\r\n2014).\r\nPolluted water is often used to irrigate crops and studies have found textile dyes\r\npresent in fruits and vegetables grown around Savar in Bangladesh (Sakamoto et al.,\r\n2019). Areas closer to industrial hubs are disproportionately impacted by the harms of\r\nfast fashion, with costs to livelihoods due to impacted agriculture or fishing, increased\r\nincidence of disease including jaundice or diarrhea, and decreased accessibility to safe\r\ndrinking water during the dry season, as contaminated surface water may be unable\r\nto be effectively treated (World Bank, 2014; Ullah et al., 2006).\r\nPesticides used in the growing of cotton and other crops have also been found to\r\nhave harmful effects on biodiversity. The textile industry is estimated to account for\r\nbetween 10-20% of global pesticide use (McKinsey & Company, 2021).\r\nOrganisms can be exposed to chemicals either directly through application or\r\nindirectly through runoff, contamination, or secondary poisoning (Beyond Pesticides).\r\nExposure to pesticides is linked to a wide array of health concerns in various species\r\nincluding birds, small mammals, insects, fish and humans. These health concerns\r\nconsist of reproductive effects, neurotoxicity, endocrine effects and liver and kidney\r\ndamage (Beyond Pesticides). Such harmful effects can occur after minimal exposure,\r\nas reproductive abnormalities have been observed in multiple species following \u201csafe\u201d\r\nlevels of exposure as classified by the United States Environmental Protection Agency\r\n(Beyond Pesticides).\r\nThe environmental impacts of fast fashion are not limited to the direct impacts from\r\nthe manufacturing process. Fast fashion churns out poorly made clothes with limited\r\nlifespans because of the low quality of materials used and the industry thriving off the\r\nconstant business from a quick turnover of garments. The quick turnover coupled\r\nwith poor quality resulted in 60% of the items manufactured in 2012 being discarded\r\nonly a few years after purchase (Shukla, 2022). One survey in Britain found that 1 in 3\r\nyoung women believed clothes to be \u201cold\u201d following as few as one or two wears\r\n(McKinsey & Company, 2018).\r\nOn average consumers are keeping purchased items about half as long as they did at\r\nthe turn of the 21st century and purchasing 60% more clothing per year (Remy et\r\nal., 2016). Based on this trend and the low prevalence of clothing recycling, over 50%\r\nAT WHAT COST? 8\r\nAT WHAT COST? 9\r\nof these garments end up in landfills (Shukla, 2022).\r\nIn 2018, 11.3 million tons of textiles entered landfills\r\nas municipal solid waste in the United States,\r\naveraging out to roughly 70 pounds of discarded\r\ngarments per person (EPA).\r\nEven for the clothing that continues to be worn and\r\nwashed, an environmental toll is paid. Synthetic\r\nfabrics release microfibers at alarming rates of\r\nroughly 700,000 fibers per load of laundry, which\r\noften end up in the ocean and other environments\r\n(Ocean Clean Wash, 2019). This adds up to\r\napproximately 500,000 tons of microfibers per year\r\nentering the ocean (Ellen MacArthur Foundation,\r\n2017). An IUCN report estimated that between\r\n15%-31% of plastic pollution in the ocean could\r\ncome from household or industrial products\r\nexpelling these microplastics, with 35% of that\r\nmicroplastic coming from the washing of synthetic\r\nfabrics (Boucher and Friot, 2017).\r\nFibers such as polyester are slow to degrade in the ocean, taking potentially up to 200\r\nyears to decompose, then producing toxic substances when they do that pose\r\ndangers for marine ecosystems (Brewer, 2019; Shukla, 2022). Microplastics pose the\r\nadditional danger of being consumed by marine organisms, then entering the food\r\nchain and being consumed eventually by humans. For marine organisms that\r\nconsume microplastics, impacts may include delayed growth, abnormal behavior, or\r\nreduced intake of food (Li et al., 2021). For humans, microplastics that have made their\r\nway up the food chain pose risks of allergic reactions or cell death (Parker, 2022).\r\nDespite the majority of fiber production being attributed to synthetic fabrics, a 2020\r\nstudy found that most microfibers were actually from cellulosic and plant-based\r\nfibers, followed by animal fibers (Suaria et al., 2020). While such natural fibers are often\r\nassumed to be biodegradable, modifications made during textile production often\r\ninclude alterations with chemicals, dyes, or coatings that in turn impact the\r\nbiodegradability of the material (Henry et al., 2019). Additional modifications that occur\r\nduring manufacturing are seen with wool, where natural fibers are often blended with\r\nsynthetics for fast fashion, impacting the biodegradability of the fabric (Center for\r\nBiological Diversity, 2021).\r\nAs much of the research on the biodegradability and risks of microfibers is new or still\r\ndeveloping, the problem of microfiber introduction from the fast fashion industry\r\ncannot yet be limited to the impacts from synthetics, as the full scope of risks of all\r\nmicrofibers is still being realized. This brings the issue of fast fashion back to the\r\nimmense scale of production, as there is not one specific fiber to blame for the\r\nenvironmental degradation but the business model as a whole.\r\nPhoto Source: Canva\r\nAT WHAT COST? 10\r\nThe introduction of chemicals to the environment is not the only harm associated\r\nwith the fast fashion industry. The harsh chemicals used in manufacturing create\r\npotential health hazards for workers and consumers. These risks can be felt in a wide\r\nrange of communities, as fast fashion garments are usually produced in low-income\r\ncountries but purchased in high-income countries.\r\nAt the beginning of the production process, pesticides can cause harm to workers as\r\nthey have been linked to acute and chronic health issues including reproductive\r\ndisorders, neurological disorders, respiratory conditions, certain cancers and death\r\n(Farmworker Justice, 2013). In garment factories, workers are exposed to occupational\r\nhazards including respiratory harms from chemicals and musculoskeletal harms from\r\nrepeated motions (Islam, 2022).\r\nThe harmful effects can even be experienced by the consumer of fast fashion.\r\nGarments contain a variety of harmful chemicals including PFAS, azo dyes, phthalates,\r\nand formaldehyde (Fashinnovation, 2022). These chemicals come with risks of\r\nirritation; respiratory, developmental, and reproductive problems; and certain cancers.\r\nOn top of that, the spillover of cheaply made fast fashion can also affect the\r\neconomies of low-income countries, even if they are not involved directly in the\r\nproduction of garments.\r\nEvery year the United States exports roughly 500,000 tons of secondhand clothing to\r\nlow- and middle-income countries that do not always possess the infrastructure to\r\nhandle it (Brooks, 2019). Reports from various African communities note how these\r\nimports can decimate local textile businesses, as they are unable to compete with the\r\ncompetitive costs of these used garments (Brooks, 2019). While this opens a new\r\nmarket for secondhand clothing, it increases reliance on foreign countries and\r\nsuppresses local industries, resulting in a loss of culture and traditional styles (Porter,\r\n2019).\r\nThe continuing desire around the world for these garments at low costs also\r\ncontributes to the ongoing injustice related to low wages and working conditions in\r\nthe low-income countries where most factories are based. In April 2013 the Rana Plaza\r\nbuilding in Dhaka, Bangladesh collapsed, resulting in more than 1,100 textile-worker\r\nfatalities and bringing to light the subpar conditions in which fast fashion industries\r\noperate. Between 2006 and 2012, more than 500 workers in Bangladesh garment\r\nfactories died in factory fires, usually due to faulty wiring (Thomas, 2018).\r\nFollowing these tragic events, the Accord on Fire and Building Safety was signed by\r\nvarious fast fashion companies, including American Eagle, H&M, and Inditex. This\r\nagreement resulted in 97,000 hazards being repaired in 1,600 factories, and 900\r\nfactories being shut down for not meeting compliance standards (Thomas, 2018).\r\nHARMS TO HUMANS\r\nFollowing the expiration of the Accord in 2018, the 2018 Transition Accord was signed\r\nto extend similar protections until 2021 (Clean Clothes Campaign). Most recently, the\r\nInternational Accord took effect in September 2021 (International Accord, 2021). This\r\nlegally binding agreement promises to ensure factory structural safety for 26 months\r\nby the brands that have signed, which can be found here.\r\nThough a small step toward remedying the worker injustices in the fast fashion\r\nindustry, these pacts have yet to address low wages or health hazards associated with\r\nthis type of factory work. Beyond historical structure-related tragedies, textile workers\r\nare exposed to various occupational hazards, including respiratory and\r\nmusculoskeletal harms (Islam, 2022). Reported health conditions that have been\r\ndocumented include endocrine damage and reproductive harms, along with\r\naccidental injuries and death (Sant\u2019Ana and Kovalechen, 2012).\r\nThese effects are spread disproportionately across genders, as most workers in these\r\nfactories are young women (Thomas, 2018). An estimated 80% of global workers in the\r\ngarment industry are women, and despite this workplace majority, discrimination,\r\ngender pay gaps, and sexual harassment continue to be reported (Baptist World Aid\r\nAustralia, 2019).\r\nWhile many companies have \u2014 or are working to establish \u2014 systems to remedy this,\r\ninequalities continue to exist in many of these garment manufacturing environments\r\n(Baptist World Aid Australia, 2019). A reported 9 out of 10 garment workers in\r\nBangladesh are paid so unfairly for their labor that they cannot afford food for\r\nthemselves or their families (Oxfam). Yet to provide workers with a livable wage would\r\ncost some companies as little as an estimated 1% of the retail price of garments\r\n(Oxfam).\r\nThe gross injustices occurring within the fast fashion industry stand against the\r\nnarrative that fast fashion benefits low-income people. Rather, it exploits workers and\r\nconsumers alike.\r\nAT WHAT COST? 11\r\nPhoto Source: Rio Lecatompessy - Unsplash\r\nDespite the various claims made by companies showcasing their sustainable efforts\r\nthrough partial recycling or \u201cconscious\u201d collections, overall efforts are still relatively\r\nlow. Even the actions of companies that are following through on their pledges to be\r\nmore sustainable are not necessarily having a significant positive impact.\r\nOne of the most common recycled materials to substitute the creation of new\r\nsynthetics are polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles. In a survey of roughly 50\r\nfashion brands, 85% claimed that they were working toward using recycled polyester\r\nsourced from plastic bottles (Circular). Using recycled polyester has the potential\r\nimpact of reducing carbon emissions by 32% (Federal Office for the Environment,\r\n2017). But while recycling sounds green in theory, there are several logistical\r\ndrawbacks.\r\nRecycling synthetic materials does not fix the emerging problem of microplastics, as\r\nrecycled materials will expel just as many fibers as new materials (Bryce, 2021).\r\nAdditionally, removing plastic bottles from their established, closed-loop system may\r\nactually harm their overall recyclable potential. These bottles can be recycled at least\r\n10 times in the current system. Feeding them into the fashion industry decreases\r\ntheir likelihood and potential to be recycled as most garments end up in landfills\r\n(Bryce, 2021). Despite the potential that exists with recycling plastic bottles, the\r\nactual rate at which PET bottles are recycled remains relatively low, with only 29.1%\r\nbeing recycled in 2018 (EPA). Textile recycling involves a similar shortcoming, as it\u2019s\r\nestimated that less than 1% of textile waste is recycled into new fibers due to\r\nlogistical issues including the collecting, sorting, and processing of garments\r\n(McKinsey & Company, 2022).\r\nMany claims made by fast fashion companies hint at sustainability but fall short, and\r\na lack of transparency contributes to the problem of greenwashing. Greenwashing is\r\ninfamous in the fast fashion industry, and multiple companies having had attention\r\ndrawn to their misleading claims in the past. Companies like Boohoo, SHEIN, H&M,\r\nASOS, and Zara have all released claims on their efforts to improve their\r\nsustainability, but there\u2019s little evidence they are realizing those claims (Rauturier,\r\n2022; Igini, 2022).\r\nThe popular brand H&M released environmental scorecards informing consumers\r\nabout how environmentally friendly their garments were. In an investigation by\r\nQuartz, more than half of the scorecards claimed pieces to be more\r\nenvironmentally friendly than they actually were, and in some instances the\r\nstatements were described as being \u201cthe exact opposite of reality\u201d (Quartz, 2022).\r\nThe garments included in the controversial claims were those labeled as\r\n\u201cConscious Choice.\u201d This specific label was described by H&M to mean \u201cpieces\r\nAT WHAT COST? 12\r\nGREENWASHING\r\n\r\nWhile many companies have environmentally harmful business models, there are\r\nothers that are taking a more meaningful approach to sustainability. These companies\r\nare actively encouraging people to extend the life of their clothing, providing\r\ncustomers with the resources to do so, and using data to back up their sustainability\r\nclaims. These claims have been published by the companies and their accuracies have\r\nnot been evaluated by this report.\r\nLevi\u2019s, for example, urges customers to wash their jeans less: after about 10 wears. This\r\nnot only lengthens the lifespan of jeans but saves water from washing machines and\r\nreduces the expelling of microfibers in the wash. Data published on Levi\u2019s website\r\nstates that taking care of your jeans and wearing them for 10 months or longer will\r\nreduce their carbon footprint by 18% and water footprint by 23%.\r\nLevi\u2019s also offers solutions for old or damaged clothing, like opening Levi\u2019s Tailor Shops\r\nwhere clothes can be altered or repaired, offering tutorials on how to perform various\r\nDIY projects on jeans, and suggesting that you donate unwanted clothing to\r\nsecondhand shops or pass items along as hand-me-downs.\r\nOther ways that brands are trying to lessen the waste in fashion is through product\r\nguarantees and resale initiatives. Patagonia includes a guarantee that if clothing\r\ndevelops damage due to wear, the company will repair it at a \u201creasonable charge.\u201d\r\nLike Levi\u2019s, Patagonia offers DIY repair guides to extend the life of products. It also\r\nhosts Worn Wear, a site where you can trade in used clothing so it can be washed and\r\nresold, lengthening the garment\u2019s lifespan. As an incentive, trading in a garment will\r\nget you credit that can be used to purchase new or used from the brand. Worn Wear\r\nalso has the additional bonus that the used articles are sold at a reduced cost\r\ncompared to new items. This increases accessibility of quality, long-lasting products to\r\nindividuals who might not be able to afford them otherwise and resort to fast fashion\r\nfor financial reasons.\r\nA PUSH TOWARD SUSTAINABILITY\r\nAT WHAT COST? 13\r\ncreated with a little extra consideration for the planet,\u201d with products containing at\r\nleast 50% of \u201cmore sustainable materials\u201d (H&M). These vaguely defined \u201ceco-friendly\u201d\r\nlabels are another popular industry greenwashing technique. But simultaneously\r\nproducing and promoting the purchase of billions of garments per year, many of\r\nwhich get discarded and replaced quickly, reduces the potential positive impacts of\r\nso-called \u201cconscious collections\u201d and falsely reassures consumers.\r\nA different approach can be seen with MUD Jeans, which in 2013 introduced a\r\nprogram called Lease a Jeans, where customers can pay a monthly fee to lease jeans\r\nfor a year, after which the payments stop and the customer can either keep the jeans\r\nor return them to be recycled. In 2021, 11,512 pairs of jeans were recycled, with a\r\ndonation to plant one tree with the nonprofit Justdiggit with every pair. By promoting\r\na circular economy through jeans recycling, MUD Jeans states, it\u2019s producing no\r\nadditional end-of-life waste for those articles and using 92% less water than the\r\naverage jeans.\r\nIn addition to creative solutions to extend the lifespans of garments and reduce waste,\r\nefforts are being made by some companies to use more sustainable materials and\r\nmanufacturing processes. For plant-based fibers like cotton, organic and recycled\r\nmaterials tend to be more sustainable than conventional and virgin materials,\r\nrespectively.\r\nTo grow cotton \u2014 one of the most commonly used fabrics in the world \u2014 a substantial\r\namount of pesticides are conventionally used. Certified organic cotton, especially\r\ngrown in countries like the United States that have strict organic standards, does not\r\ncontain the dangerous pesticide load of conventional cotton. And recycled cotton\r\ndoes not take any additional pesticides to produce, reduces water consumption, and\r\nprevents garments from being sent to landfills.\r\nFlax (linen) and hemp are two additional, versatile crops that can be used for textiles.\r\nBoth are relatively environmentally friendly alternatives as they require minimal water\r\nand are often grown with little to no pesticides. Hemp grows so densely that it can\r\nreduce competition, and it also naturally deters pests (Hymann, 2020). Linen uses less\r\nwater and fewer pesticides than conventional cotton and has the benefit that the\r\nplant it\u2019s derived from is typically used in its entirety, reducing overall waste during\r\nproduction (Newman, 2020). Linen\u2019s natural hues come in a variety of colors including\r\nivory, tan, and grays, reducing the amount of dyes necessary (Newman, 2020). When\r\nuntreated, linen is entirely biodegradable.\r\nIn a push for more sustainable options, new materials are being derived from various\r\ntypes of plants. Bananatex is a relatively new fabric made from Abac\u00e1 banana plants\r\nthat is fully biodegradable and circular. This plant has many environmental\r\nadvantages, including that it does not require the use of pesticides, fertilizers, or\r\nadditional water (Bananatex). These characteristics have helped to contribute to\r\nreforestation in certain areas, strengthening biodiversity (Bananatex).\r\nOn top of using more sustainable fabrics, environmentally conscientious companies\r\nare taking additional steps to reduce waste in their supply chains. Efforts include\r\nusing recycled, plastic-free, or compostable packaging, using less harmful chemicals,\r\nand getting energy from cleaner sources such as solar power. While there is room for\r\nadditional reform in the fashion industry, a few examples of brands working towards\r\nmore sustainable practices can be seen here.\r\nNecessary reform of the fast fashion industry must involve voices from all levels. This\r\nAT WHAT COST? 14\r\nincludes individuals pushing for change, governments enacting policies that can\r\noversee change, and companies committing to make the change. Fast fashion\r\ncompanies need to be held accountable for their destructive practices, including the\r\nwaste they produce and the worker injustice that their business models are built\r\naround. Companies\u2019 flimsy claims of future reform are no longer enough.\r\nPolicy efforts to improve the fashion industry have involved the health and safety of\r\ngarment workers, unfair wages, and transparency of environmental impacts. U.S.\r\npolicies of note include The Fashioning Accountability and Building Real Institutional\r\nChange (FABRIC) Act, The Fashion and Sustainability and Social Accountability Act,\r\nand the SWEAT Bill.\r\nThe FABRIC Act is a federal bill that was introduced in May 2022. This legislature would\r\nprotect nearly 100,000 American garment workers, improving working conditions and\r\nwages, revitalizing the U.S. garment industry and investing in domestic apparel\r\nproduction (The FABRIC Act).\r\nThe Fashion and Sustainability and Social Accountability Act was referred to the\r\nConsumer Protection Committee in early 2022 and requires fashion manufacturers\r\nand retail sellers to disclose environmental policies along with social due diligence\r\npolicies. This state bill would also establish a community benefit fund that would help\r\nimplement projects that directly benefit environmental justice communities (New\r\nYork Senate).\r\nThe SWEAT Bill passed assembly in March 2022. This state bill involves ensuring the\r\npayment of wages for work that was already performed. It also \u201ccreates a lien remedy\r\nfor all employees; provides grounds for attachment; relates to procedures where\r\nemployees may hold shareholders of non-publicly traded corporations personally\r\nliable for wage theft; relates to rights for victims of wage theft to hold the ten\r\nmembers with the largest ownership interests in a company personally liable for wage\r\ntheft\u201d (New York Senate).\r\nIf companies are required or incentivized to pursue more sustainable practices, the\r\nscale of destruction caused by the fashion industry could be significantly lessened.\r\nAdditional work that could help to reform the fashion industry includes making\r\nsustainable fashion more affordable, so people of limited means are not forced to buy\r\nfast fashion, along with making fast fashion companies internalize the environmental\r\ncosts of their production and waste.\r\n"}

To effect the latter, then-AAG Makan Delrahim devised a divestiture that would reposition satellite-TV provider DISH as Sprint\u2019s replacement. \nHere was his plan: Sprint would sell its prepaid-wireless assets to DISH. These assets included Sprint\u2019s 9.3 million prepaid subscribers, its Boost brand, its 800 MHz spectrum licenses, and the Sprint stores and cell towers that the new T-Mobile did not want. DISH would then use these cell sites and its pre-existing spectrum, augmented from the divestiture, to build its own wireless network using never-before-deployed technology. While DISH worked on its complex nationwide build, it could serve its customers by paying for them to roam on the new T-Mobile\u2019s infrastructure for seven years. \nNot even two years later, Delrahim\u2019s plan is already falling apart.\nThe prepaid customers DISH inherited from Sprint disproportionately buy cheap wireless service, which runs on the old CDMA standard used in 3G networks. In the latest turn of events, T-Mobile announced last month that it would discontinue its CDMA service in January 2022, nearly two years ahead of schedule. With T-Mobile\u2019s shutdown, DISH\u2019s customers will have to \u201cget new devices, new SIMs, or upgrade via software.\u201d DISH now has to take on an unexpected upgrade that will cost hundreds of millions of dollars. \nT-Mobile\u2019s announcement led DISH CEO Charlie Ergen to denounce the unexpected shutdown as \u201canticompetitive.\u201d DISH has already warned investors that with the shutdown, its trend of bleeding hundreds of thousands of subscribers may soon turn into a hemorrhage. \nFor T-Mobile, this is great news, since many of the subscribers ditching DISH are bound to turn to T-Mobile\u2019s own cheap wireless plan. But for price-sensitive consumers, the forecast is grim: while they could choose between T-Mobile and Sprint before the merger, these dissatisfied customers now effectively face a monopoly provider. \nIt should come as no surprise that DISH is struggling in the wireless market, and price-conscious consumers are bearing the brunt of harm from the merger\u2019s fallout. We knew back in 2011 that T-Mobile and Sprint competed particularly closely in low-cost wireless services. We also knew from DOJ\u2019s longstanding Merger Remedies Policy that remedies should not require an entrant like DISH to depend on an incumbent who is a direct rival; it makes perfect sense that T-Mobile would rebel against helping DISH grow into a firm that can compete against T-Mobile itself.\nNot only was the DISH divestiture ill-devised, but the T-Mobile/Sprint merger never did pass muster under basic logic. If it was really critical to keep four players in the wireless market\u2014so important that DISH needed to enter\u2014why even let T-Mobile buy Sprint in the first place? Why not just keep the existing fourth player, instead of designing a Rube Goldberg settlement in the hopes that a new player will grow to have the competitive force of Sprint in seven years\u2019 time? \nThese frustrations have fueled heated criticism of the merger. Such critiques are well-placed, as the merger has already produced harm and threatens to wreak more damage. Besides hobbling DISH, T-Mobile will degrade the quality of its service this April by automatically enrolling its subscribers into an aggressive, personalized ad-targeting program. T-Mobile has also signaled to investors that it has become more like its rivals Verizon and AT&T. On an investor call in February, CEO Mike Sievert said, \u201cWe\u2019ve competed mostly on price in the past, if we\u2019re honest. Now, we have a premium product.\u201d \nTranslation: the era of aggressive price competition in wireless is over. Looking forward, we can expect T-Mobile, AT&T, and Verizon to nestle into a cozy triopoly that returns immense profits to their shareholders. T-Mobile is already prepared to deliver on this prospect. On March 11, it predicted to investors that its free cash flow will be flush enough to support a $60 billion stock buyback within five years. \nStock buybacks benefit the investor class, whose members are disproportionately the wealthiest people in America; recent surveys show that the top 10 percent of households own approximately 80 percent of all stocks. In contrast, nearly all households across the income distribution buy wireless services, and low-income households particularly favor prepaid plans, a segment where T-Mobile and Sprint had competed vigorously pre-merger. With its latest proclamations to investors, T-Mobile celebrates the fact that its merger will transfer billions of wealth from average Americans to the rich, further widening the chasm between the haves and have-nots. For this reason and many others, the T-Mobile/Sprint deal will go down as one of the worst merger-enforcement decisions in decades. \n\u201cTHE T-MOBILE/SPRINT DEAL WILL GO DOWN AS ONE OF THE WORST MERGER-ENFORCEMENT DECISIONS IN DECADES.\u201d \nIn this postmortem, we examine how the deal came to close, and what we might learn from the mistakes made along the way.\nThe Prosecutor: Dealmaker Delrahim Helming DOJ\nDOJ should never have approved the deal in the first place. The T-Mobile/Sprint merger presented a harmful 4-to-3 combination in the critical and well-defined market of mobile wireless services. Four-to-three mergers deservedly raise eyebrows, and evidence from other countries showed that 4-3 mergers in the wireless market would increase prices. Further, the post-merger market shares blasted through the HHI thresholds in the Horizontal Merger Guidelines, making the transaction presumptively anticompetitive. As such, a settlement should never have been on the table. \nBut after many years of trying to merge, the parties finally found a receptive agency head in Delrahim, the \u201cveteran lobbyist\u201d tapped to be head of the Trump Administration\u2019s Antitrust Division. When presented with the deal, Delrahim was eager to refashion the telecom market and less eager to deliver on his charge of protecting consumer welfare.  \nDelrahim took a series of unorthodox steps. He became a mediator between the parties, helping hold the deal together when tensions between the CEOs ran high. He exchanged text messages with Ergen and advised him on how to secure regulatory approval from the Federal Communications Commission, which also needed to approve the deal. And when the parties closed their transaction in July 2020, Delrahim issued a press release to \u201ccongratulate\u201d T-Mobile and Sprint for merging. \nNot only did his conduct conflict with his role as the nation\u2019s head antitrust enforcer, but the behavioral remedy Delrahim reached in T-Mobile/Sprint contradicted his 2017 statements. Then, with an eye toward signaling his unwillingness to settle in AT&T/Time Warner, he inveighed against behavioral remedies. \u201c[A]t times antitrust enforcers have experimented with allowing illegal mergers to proceed subject to certain behavioral commitments. That approach is fundamentally regulatory, imposing ongoing government oversight on what should preferably be a free market.\u201d He added, \u201c[I]f a merger is illegal, we should only accept a clean and complete solution.\u201d Perhaps Delrahim was conscious of his hypocrisy when he later announced the settlement he had reached in the T-Mobile/Sprint merger, as he was careful to cast it as \u201cstructural\u201d and not \u201cbehavioral.\u201d But because the crux of the settlement is to have DISH roam on T-Mobile\u2019s network for seven years, the settlement is behavioral at its core.\nStudying the divestiture against the Trump-era DOJ\u2019s handling of other antitrust cases sheds additional light. Compare Delrahim\u2019s adamant refusal to accept behavioral conditions when the parties proposed them in AT&T/Time Warner\u2014which presented a weaker merits case\u2014with his enthusiasm to strike behavioral conditions in the T-Mobile/Sprint divestiture to DISH\u2014even though this 4-3 merger was presumptively illegal and raised nearly every red flag in the Horizontal Merger Guidelines. Taken together, these two decisions cannot be reconciled on principle. \nThe Court: Judge Marrero Fails as \u201cFortuneteller\u201d\nBecause the Delrahim-led DOJ was derelict in policing the T-Mobile/Sprint deal, a group of states challenged the merger in federal court. In presenting their case, they pointed out flaws in the DISH settlement\u2014chiefly that the divestiture relied on T-Mobile to help DISH grow to scale in wireless, but T-Mobile would have the ability and incentive to cripple DISH. \nAt trial in the Southern District of New York, Ergen testified that he was confident DISH would receive adequate service from T-Mobile through the roaming agreement, even though new T-Mobile and DISH would compete for wireless subscribers. He offered that DISH had never had a problem with buying services from AT&T, despite AT&T\u2019s DirecTV competing head-to-head with DISH\u2019s satellite-television offering. \nErgen, however, conveniently omitted the fact that AT&T, after merging with Time Warner, had blacked out HBO and Cinemax for DISH\u2019s satellite and Sling TV subscribers. The loss of AT&T\u2019s content contributed to DISH\u2019s loss of more than 330,000 subscribers that quarter. Despite this recent experience, Ergen maintained in court that there would be no problem with DISH relying on a direct competitor for a critical input in the mobile-wireless industry it was preparing to enter.\nJudge Victor Marrero did pick up on this danger during his questioning at trial, but he ultimately believed the DOJ-appointed monitor and wholesale-price formula would be enough to rein in T-Mobile\u2019s incentives. We have now seen that those checks were inadequate. This is no surprise, as economic theory predicts that companies\u2019 profit incentives are strong enough to overcome inevitably incomplete contractual restraints.\nMore generally, Judge Marrero underestimated the strength of the parties\u2019 incentives in his assessment of the merger. Instead of accounting for how the merger would facilitate collusion by creating three symmetrical players, for instance, he decided it would be easier to assess witness credibility. Judge Marrero purported to study the executives\u2019 behavior and glean \u201ctelltale\u201d patterns of truthfulness, concluding that the new T-Mobile would continue to compete vigorously against AT&T and Verizon. In so doing, he placed his faith in the self-serving testimony of executives rather than in decades of enforcement experience, economic evidence, and jurisprudence.\n", "full_prompt": "{Query}\n=======\nAccording to the text, why is the T-Mobile/Sprint merger considered a disaster?\n\n\n{Task}\n=======\nProvide your answer in full sentences, referencing the document using quotations.\n\n\n{Document}\n=======\nThe Real Dish on the T-Mobile/Sprint Merger: A Disastrous Deal From the Start\n\nWhen the Trump-era DOJ allowed T-Mobile and Sprint to merge in July 2019, it promised the best of both worlds: consumers would benefit from T-Mobile\u2019s accelerated 5G deployment and retain a fourth wireless provider.

{"system_instruction": "<TASK DESCRIPTION>\n Only use the provided text to answer the question, no outside sources.\n \n\n <QUESTION>\n [user request]\n \n\n <TEXT>\n [context document]", "user_request": "Explain the benefits for a tech company of upgrading their frontend codebase from the AngularJS framework to the modern Angular framework in less than 200 words.", "context_document": "The Risks of Sticking with Outdated Frameworks\n Security Vulnerabilities\n Every software framework, including Angular, has vulnerabilities that are discovered and patched over time. Running an outdated version means your application is exposed to known security issues that could have been mitigated with an upgrade. For example, Angular has had several security updates over the years addressing issues such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and dependency vulnerabilities. By not upgrading, you leave your application susceptible to attacks that can compromise user data and damage your company's reputation.\n \n\n Example: In AngularJs 1.6.3, a critical security vulnerability was discovered that allowed attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code via the ngSanitize service. This issue was patched in a subsequent release. Companies still running Angular 1.6.3 or earlier are at risk of exploitation. Despite Angular 1.6.3 being an old version, it serves as an example because many legacy systems still run on AngularJS (Angular 1.x), and these systems are particularly vulnerable if not properly maintained.\n \n\n Performance Improvements\n Each new version of Angular introduces performance optimizations that make your application faster and more efficient. These improvements are often the result of extensive research and development by the Angular team, and they can have a significant impact on your application's load times and responsiveness.\n \n\n Example: Angular 9 introduced the Ivy compiler, which drastically reduced the size of compiled JavaScript bundles, leading to faster load times and improved performance. Applications that have not upgraded to Angular 9 or later are missing out on these substantial gains.\n \n\n Compatibility and Support\n Frameworks evolve to support new web standards, browser features, and third-party integrations. Running an outdated version of Angular can lead to compatibility issues with modern tools and libraries, making it harder to integrate new features or technologies into your application.\n \n\n Example: Angular 12 introduced strict mode, which improves maintainability and reduces the likelihood of runtime errors. It also provides better support for TypeScript 4.2, which includes new language features and performance enhancements. Sticking with an older version may result in compatibility issues and technical debt.\n \n\n Developer Satisfaction\n Developer satisfaction is crucial for retaining top talent and ensuring high productivity levels. Developers prefer working with the latest technologies to stay current with industry trends and advance their careers. Using an outdated tech stack can lead to frustration and decreased motivation, as developers may feel they are missing out on learning and growth opportunities. Nobody wants to work with old technologies that do not provide the modern conveniences, performance improvements, and security features available in newer versions.\n \n\n Example: A team of developers working with an outdated version of Angular might feel demotivated compared to their peers who are using the latest version with advanced features and improved tooling. This can lead to higher turnover rates as developers seek opportunities that allow them to work with cutting-edge technologies.\n \n\n Compliance and Regulatory Requirements\n Many industries, especially those dealing with sensitive information like finance and healthcare, are subject to strict regulatory requirements. Using outdated software can lead to non-compliance, resulting in fines and legal consequences. Regulatory bodies often require that software be up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities.\n \n\n Example: In the banking sector, projects are often marked as security risks if they use outdated npm packages with known vulnerabilities. This non-compliance can lead to audits and penalties. Tools like Black Duck and SonarQube (Sonar) scans are frequently used to ensure compliance by identifying and reporting outdated or vulnerable dependencies. Black Duck, for instance, provides detailed reports on open-source component risks, helping teams understand the implications of using outdated libraries.\n \n\n Current Angular Versions\n As of June 2024, the current supported versions of Angular are 18, 17, 16. Angular follows a regular release cycle with Long-Term Support (LTS) versions that receive updates for an extended period (12 months), providing stability and security for production applications.\n \n\n Unsupported Angular Versions\n It's important to be aware of the Angular versions that are no longer supported, as they do not receive security updates or bug fixes. Angular versions v2 to v15 are no longer supported.\n \n\n Using these unsupported versions can expose your application to security risks and compatibility issues.\n \n\n Overcoming the Resistance to Upgrade\n Managers often resist upgrading frameworks due to concerns about the perceived disruption to business delivery. However, the risks associated with running outdated software can far outweigh the temporary inconvenience of an upgrade. Here are some strategies to help convince your manager:\n \n\n Highlight Security Risks:\n Emphasize the importance of security in protecting user data and maintaining trust. Provide examples of high-profile security breaches that were the result of outdated software. Explain that the cost of a security incident, in terms of both financial impact and reputation damage, can be far greater than the cost of an upgrade.\n \n\n Example: The Equifax data breach in 2017, which exposed the personal information of 147 million people, was partly due to an unpatched vulnerability in a web application framework. This breach resulted in a $700 million settlement.\n \n\n Demonstrate Cost Savings:\n While the initial investment in upgrading may seem high, it can lead to long-term cost savings by reducing technical debt, minimizing downtime, and improving developer efficiency. Provide a cost-benefit analysis that compares the costs of an upgrade to the potential costs of security breaches, performance issues, and maintenance of outdated code.\n \n\n Example: A study by IBM found that the average cost of a data breach is $3.86 million. Investing in regular upgrades can mitigate these risks and save significant costs in the long run.\n \n\n Showcase Success Stories:\n Provide case studies of companies that have successfully upgraded their frameworks and reaped the benefits. Highlight improvements in security, performance, and developer productivity. This can help alleviate fears and demonstrate the tangible benefits of staying up-to-date.\n \n\n Example: A major e-commerce company upgraded from AngularJS to Angular 10 and saw a 30% improvement in page load times, resulting in a 15% increase in user engagement and a 10% boost in sales.\n \n\n Plan for Minimal Disruption:\n Develop a detailed upgrade plan that minimizes disruption to business delivery. This can include phased rollouts, thorough testing, and parallel development to ensure a smooth transition. Demonstrating a well-thought-out plan can help reassure managers that the upgrade will not negatively impact ongoing projects.\n \n\n Example: Conduct a pilot upgrade with a smaller, less critical part of the application to identify potential issues and develop solutions before rolling out the upgrade to the entire system.\n \n\n Creating a Framework or Developer Experience (DX) Team\n One effective strategy to ensure regular upgrades and maintenance of frameworks is to establish a dedicated Framework or Developer Experience (DX) team. This team can take responsibility for monitoring updates, assessing their impact, and planning upgrades without disrupting the core business activities.\n \n\n Example: A large tech company established a DX team tasked with maintaining the development environment and ensuring all frameworks and libraries are up-to-date. This team conducted regular audits using tools like Black Duck and SonarQube to identify outdated dependencies and potential security risks. They then worked with development teams to plan and implement upgrades in a phased and controlled manner, ensuring minimal disruption to ongoing projects.\n \n\n Example: A financial institution formed a Framework Team to handle all aspects of framework maintenance, including Angular upgrades. This team used automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities and compliance issues, producing regular reports and actionable insights. By centralizing this responsibility, the institution was able to stay compliant with regulatory requirements and avoid potential security risks associated with outdated software.", "full_prompt": "<TASK DESCRIPTION>\n Only use the provided text to answer the question, no outside sources.\n \n\n <QUESTION>\n Explain the benefits for a tech company of upgrading their frontend codebase from the AngularJS framework to the modern Angular framework in less than 200 words.\n \n\n <TEXT>\n The Risks of Sticking with Outdated Frameworks\n Security Vulnerabilities\n Every software framework, including Angular, has vulnerabilities that are discovered and patched over time.

Regulatory bodies often require that software be up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities.\n \n\n Example: In the banking sector, projects are often marked as security risks if they use outdated npm packages with known vulnerabilities. This non-compliance can lead to audits and penalties. Tools like Black Duck and SonarQube (Sonar) scans are frequently used to ensure compliance by identifying and reporting outdated or vulnerable dependencies. Black Duck, for instance, provides detailed reports on open-source component risks, helping teams understand the implications of using outdated libraries.\n \n\n Current Angular Versions\n As of June 2024, the current supported versions of Angular are 18, 17, 16. Angular follows a regular release cycle with Long-Term Support (LTS) versions that receive updates for an extended period (12 months), providing stability and security for production applications.\n \n\n Unsupported Angular Versions\n It's important to be aware of the Angular versions that are no longer supported, as they do not receive security updates or bug fixes. Angular versions v2 to v15 are no longer supported.\n \n\n Using these unsupported versions can expose your application to security risks and compatibility issues.\n \n\n Overcoming the Resistance to Upgrade\n Managers often resist upgrading frameworks due to concerns about the perceived disruption to business delivery. However, the risks associated with running outdated software can far outweigh the temporary inconvenience of an upgrade. Here are some strategies to help convince your manager:\n \n\n Highlight Security Risks:\n Emphasize the importance of security in protecting user data and maintaining trust. Provide examples of high-profile security breaches that were the result of outdated software. Explain that the cost of a security incident, in terms of both financial impact and reputation damage, can be far greater than the cost of an upgrade.\n \n\n Example: The Equifax data breach in 2017, which exposed the personal information of 147 million people, was partly due to an unpatched vulnerability in a web application framework. This breach resulted in a $700 million settlement.\n \n\n Demonstrate Cost Savings:\n While the initial investment in upgrading may seem high, it can lead to long-term cost savings by reducing technical debt, minimizing downtime, and improving developer efficiency. Provide a cost-benefit analysis that compares the costs of an upgrade to the potential costs of security breaches, performance issues, and maintenance of outdated code.\n \n\n Example: A study by IBM found that the average cost of a data breach is $3.86 million. Investing in regular upgrades can mitigate these risks and save significant costs in the long run.\n \n\n Showcase Success Stories:\n Provide case studies of companies that have successfully upgraded their frameworks and reaped the benefits. Highlight improvements in security, performance, and developer productivity. This can help alleviate fears and demonstrate the tangible benefits of staying up-to-date.\n \n\n Example: A major e-commerce company upgraded from AngularJS to Angular 10 and saw a 30% improvement in page load times, resulting in a 15% increase in user engagement and a 10% boost in sales.\n \n\n Plan for Minimal Disruption:\n Develop a detailed upgrade plan that minimizes disruption to business delivery. This can include phased rollouts, thorough testing, and parallel development to ensure a smooth transition. Demonstrating a well-thought-out plan can help reassure managers that the upgrade will not negatively impact ongoing projects.\n \n\n Example: Conduct a pilot upgrade with a smaller, less critical part of the application to identify potential issues and develop solutions before rolling out the upgrade to the entire system.\n \n\n Creating a Framework or Developer Experience (DX) Team\n One effective strategy to ensure regular upgrades and maintenance of frameworks is to establish a dedicated Framework or Developer Experience (DX) team. This team can take responsibility for monitoring updates, assessing their impact, and planning upgrades without disrupting the core business activities.\n \n\n Example: A large tech company established a DX team tasked with maintaining the development environment and ensuring all frameworks and libraries are up-to-date. This team conducted regular audits using tools like Black Duck and SonarQube to identify outdated dependencies and potential security risks. They then worked with development teams to plan and implement upgrades in a phased and controlled manner, ensuring minimal disruption to ongoing projects.\n \n\n Example: A financial institution formed a Framework Team to handle all aspects of framework maintenance, including Angular upgrades. This team used automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities and compliance issues, producing regular reports and actionable insights. By centralizing this responsibility, the institution was able to stay compliant with regulatory requirements and avoid potential security risks associated with outdated software.\n https://dev.to/this-is-angular/the-importance-of-upgrading-frameworks-a-case-for-angular-5c91"}

The early payments may be all or almost all payments of interest owed on the loan, with the balloon payment being the principal of the loan. This type of loan is known as a balloon loan.\nThe balloon home mortgage loan became common in the years before the 2007-2008 financial crisis. It allowed people eager to buy a home to obtain a mortgage payment that they could afford, at least in the early years.\nThe balloon loan did not disappear with the financial crisis but is now more often used for business loans. A project can be financed with a loan that allows for minimal payments early on, with the balloon payment due only when the project is earning a return on the investment.\nA balloon payment is a type of loan structured so that the last payment is far larger than prior payments.\nBalloon payments are an option for home mortgages, auto loans, and business loans.\nBorrowers have lower initial monthly payments under a balloon loan.\nThe interest rate is usually higher for a balloon loan, and only borrowers with high creditworthiness are considered.\nThe balloon payment may be a weighted payment amount or, under an interest-only payment plan, be the full balance of the principal due.\nUnderstanding Balloon Payments\nAs the term \"balloon\" suggests, the final payment on this type of loan is significantly large.\nIn recent years, balloon payments have been more common in commercial lending than in consumer lending. It allows a commercial lender to keep short-term costs lower and take care of the balloon payment with future earnings.\nThe same logic is used by individual homebuyers, but the risks are greater. Homebuyers are keeping their short-term costs low while assuming that their incomes will be far greater when the balloon payment comes due, that they will be able to refinance their mortgage before it is due, or that they can sell the house and pay off the entire mortgage before the balloon payment comes due.\nThat strategy failed in the 2008-2009 financial crisis, when homeowners who financed their purchases with balloon mortgages found it impossible to sell their homes at a price high enough to pay off the amount they had borrowed.\nBalloon payments are often packaged into two-step mortgages. In this financing structure, a borrower receives an introductory and often lower interest rate at the start of their loan. Then, the loan shifts to a higher interest rate after an initial borrowing period.\nBalloon Payment Examples\nA balloon debt structure can be implemented for any type of debt. It's most commonly used in mortgages, auto loans, and business loans.\nMortgage\nThe balloon mortgage is rarely used for traditional 15-year or 30-year mortgages since lenders don't want to wait that long to get their money back. For balloon mortgages, lenders prefer a five-year to ten-year term.\nInterest-only balloon mortgages are available primarily to high-net-worth individuals who can afford large down payments. They are often taken with the intention of refinancing before the balloon payment is due.\nBalloon Loan vs. ARM\nA balloon loan is sometimes confused with an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM). With an ARM, the borrower receives an introductory rate for a set amount of time, usually for one to five years. The interest rate resets at that point and might continue to reset periodically until the loan has been fully repaid.\nThe incentive is a very low-interest rate at the beginning, compared to the fixed-rate mortgage rate. The downside is the potential for a substantially higher rate down the road.\nBusiness Loan\nIt is usually easier for a business to secure a balloon loan if the business has a proven financial history and favorable credit record. An established business can be in a better position than an individual wage-earner to raise sufficient money to pay off the balloon payment.\nFor this reason, lenders often consider businesses less risky than individual consumers for business loans.\nBalloon payments can be strategically used by a business to finance short-term needs. The business may draw on a balloon loan with no intention of holding the debt to the end of the term. Instead, the company can use the money to repay the loan in full before the end of the loan term.\nOptions for Avoiding a Balloon Payment\nA borrower has a couple of ways to get rid of a looming payment. In addition to extinguishing the debt by paying off the balloon payment, a borrower can:\nRefinance the loan. A lender may be willing to work with a borrower to repurpose the debt into a different loan vehicle or modify the terms of the original agreement.\nSell the underlying asset. If the balloon payment is due to the purchase of an asset, a borrower may be forced to liquidate the holding to avoid defaulting on the loan.\nPay principal upfront. Though not required, a borrower may be able to pay a portion of the debt early. Any payment made more than the interest assessment will be applied to the principal balance. Check with your lender to ensure there are no prepayment penalties or fees.\nNegotiate an extension. Similar to refinancing, an extension changes the terms of the prior loan. However, instead of receiving a new deal, an extension will simply push out the timing of the balloon payment. You'll likely have the same payment terms as before but with different obligation dates.\nBalloon loans usually require collateral. For home or car loans, the lender may require a lien on the property being purchased. Should you default on your loan and not be able to satisfy the balloon payment, the lender has a legal claim to seize the property.\nAdvantages of Balloon Payments\nThe obvious advantage of balloon payments is the low initial payment requirement. The monthly balloon payment amount during the fixed period is generally less than the payment amount of a fully amortized loan.\nThe timing of the payment size may mesh well with the borrower's income expectations. As the borrower's salary increases due to career progression, the debt obligation will rise as well.\nA balloon note or loan often has a shorter underwriting process compared to other loans. For this reason, there may be lower administrative or transaction fees in securing the loan. A borrower may also not be required to show as much documentation for this type of loan, as balloon mortgages often do not require a home appraisal as part of loan closing.\nA balloon payment structure is strategically advantageous for some borrowers. For example, people who flip houses can secure lower upfront monthly payments. The borrower has time to remodel the house and sell it before the balloon payment is due.\nThis allows borrowers to preserve future cash flow for other purposes.\nDisadvantages of Balloon Payments\nBalloon payments can be a big problem in a falling housing market.\nAs home prices decline, homeowners may be unable to sell their homes for enough to cover the balloon payment, and they might be unable to sell at any price.\nFor home flippers, this means getting stuck with a high-interest rate loan should sales stall.\nBorrowers often have no choice but to default on their loans and enter foreclosure, regardless of their household incomes, when faced with a balloon payment they cannot afford. This results in the loss of the borrower's home.\nSome will be able to take out another loan to cover the upcoming balloon mortgage payment, but this puts a tremendous strain on a family's finances.\nBalloon mortgages and auto loans may be difficult to refinance depending on the amount of equity that has been paid off. The loans may only pay interest early on. In this case, the owner may have little-to-no equity in the property despite making consistent payments for years.\nThese types of loans can be harder to qualify for. Because principal payments are deferred, lenders often prefer borrowers with a high credit score or high down payment. In addition, to compensate for the flexibility of the principal obligation and increased risk for the lender, lenders usually charge higher interest rates for balloon debt compared to other types of loans. What Is a Balloon Payment?\nA balloon payment is a lump sum principal balance that is due at the end of a loan term. The borrower pays much smaller monthly payments until the balloon payment is due. These payments may be entirely or almost entirely interest on the loan rather than principal.\nBorrowers are assuming that they can refinance the mortgage or sell the home at a profit before the balloon payment falls due.

In Italy, an ADHD diagnosis can only be made at a regional referral centre approved by the Italian Ministry of Health.

Neuropharmacological studies have provided evidence that ADHD involves dysregulation of both noradrenaline (NE) and DA neurotransmitter systems [59]. MPH treatment causes an increase in DA signalling through multiple actions, including blockade of the DA reuptake transporter, amplification of DA response duration, disinhibition of the dopamine D2 receptor and amplification of DA tone [60]. MPH is also an inhibitor of NE re-uptake. ATX is a selective inhibitor of synaptic re-uptake, and in vivo, it specifically increases extracellular levels of DA in the prefrontal cortex but not in the striatum; probably by modulating cortical synaptic DA uptake via the NE transporter [61]. Dextroamphetamine increases the synaptic activity of DA and NE by increasing the release of the neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft, decreasing reuptake back into the presynaptic neuron, and inhibiting their catabolism [62]. Strong evidence exists indicating that stimulant medications, such as MPH and dextroamphetamine, and the non-stimulant ATX, are effective in improving ADHD symptoms [63]. Guanfacine is a selective alpha2A adrenergic receptor agonist, which improves working memory by stimulating postsynaptic alpha2A adrenoceptors, strengthening the functional connectivity of prefrontal cortex networks [64]. Guanfacine has also been shown to be effective in reducing ADHD symptoms [65, 66]. Table 1 summarises the most important characteristics of these pharmacological treatments for ADHD.

MPH appears to cause minor increases in BP and HR, with no strong data to suggest that itincreases the QT interval. Limited data suggest that ATX may increase BP and HR in the short term; in the long term it appears to only increase BP. The effects of ATX on QT interval remain uncertain. Because the current evidence is based on research that has not been specifically designed to investigate the cardiovascular effects of these drugs, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions [67].\n \n\n Both MPH and ATX significantly increase activation in key cortical and subcortical regions subserving attention and executive functions.

Patients receiving pharmacological treatment for ADHD should always be closely monitored for both common and unusual potentially severe adverse effects.\n https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1824-7288-36-79"}

", "user_request": "What are some examples of visible and hidden biases that have been observed in criminal justice AI? ", "context_document": "Executive Summary \r\n\u2018Artificial Intelligence\u2019 (\u2018AI\u2019), comprising machine-learning and other analytical algorithm-based  automated systems, has become an important aspect of our lives. In recent years, this technology has  been increasingly deployed in criminal justice systems across the world, playing an increasingly  significant role in the administration of justice in criminal cases. This trend is often driven by  perceptions about the reliability and impartiality of technological solutions, and pressures to make  cost savings in policing and court services. \r\nHowever, studies in various jurisdictions, including in Europe, provide substantial evidence that AI and  machine-learning systems can have a significantly negative influence on criminal justice.  \r\nAI systems have been shown to directly generate and reinforce discriminatory and unjust outcomes;  infringing fundamental rights, they have been found to have little to no positive influence on the  quality of human decisions, and they have been criticised for poor design that does not comply with  human rights standards.  \r\nMost AI systems used in criminal justice systems are statistical models, based on data which is representative of structural biases and inequalities in the societies which the data represents, and  which is always comprehensively lacking in the kind of detail that is needed to make truly \u2018accurate\u2019  predictions or decisions. The data used to build and populate these systems is mostly or entirely from  within criminal justice systems, such as law enforcement or crime records. This data does not  represent an accurate record of criminality, but merely a record of law enforcement - the crimes,  locations and groups that are policed within that society, rather than the actual occurrence of crime.  The data reflects social inequalities and discriminatory policing patterns, and its use in these AI  systems merely results in a reinforcement and re-entrenchment of those inequalities and  discrimination in criminal justice outcomes.  \r\nGiven these extremely serious risks, strong regulatory frameworks are needed to govern the use of AI  in criminal justice decision-making and, in some circumstances, to restrict its use entirely.  \r\nExisting EU data protection laws restrict the use of automated decisions, but there are gaps and  ambiguities that could result in the use of AI systems in ways that undermine human rights, if not  accompanied by further guidance or legislation.  \r\nFirstly, EU laws currently only prohibit decisions that are solely based on automated processes, but  they do not regulate decision-making processes that are largely dependent on automated systems.  Given that most AI systems in use today are designed and deployed to assist, rather than replace, human decision-making in criminal justice systems, they largely fall outside the remit of EU data  protection laws on automated decisions. Secondly, the prohibition on automated decisions is subject  to broad exceptions. Individuals can be subject to decisions based solely on automated processes if  authorised by EU or Member State law, and there are deemed to be appropriate human rights  safeguards in place, including the right to obtain human intervention. However, there is not enough  clarity on what safeguards are needed, and how \u2018human intervention\u2019 should be interpreted.  \r\nIn order to regulate the use of AI in criminal justice proceedings, the EU must, at a minimum, set  standards to address the following questions: \r\n1) what standards are needed to govern the design and deployment of AI systems in criminal  justice systems;  \r\n2) what safeguards are needed in criminal justice proceedings to make sure that AI systems are  used in accordance with human rights standards and prevent discrimination; and \r\n \r\n3) how Member States should govern the deployment of AI systems and monitor their  subsequent use.  \r\nThe design of AI systems and their deployment in criminal justice proceedings should be regulated to generate human rights compliant, non-discriminatory outcomes. Minimum standards and safeguards  should be set, which, if they cannot be adhered to, should preclude the use of the AI system in  question. AI should also be regulated so that they are sufficiently transparent and explainable to  enable effective independent scrutiny. AI systems should be designed and deployed to comply with  and give effect to inter alia the right of access to court, the right to be presumed innocent, and the  right to liberty. AI systems should not undermine the right to be tried by an impartial and independent  tribunal and, in line with existing EU laws, no individual should be subject to an automated decision  that results in a criminal record. AI systems should be designed so that they do not pre-designate an  individual as a criminal before trial, nor should they allow the police to take unjustified,  disproportionate measures against individuals without reasonable suspicion. AI systems that inform  criminal justice outcomes should, as a general rule, favour outcomes that are favourable to the  defendant. Where AI systems inform decisions on the deprivations of liberty, they should be calibrated  to generate outcomes that favour release, and they should not facilitate detention other than as a  measure of last resort. AI systems must be subject to rigorous testing to ensure that they have the  desired effect of reducing pre-trial detention rates. \r\nAI systems must be developed to guarantee that they do not generate discriminatory outcomes,  ensuring that suspects and accused persons are not disadvantaged, either directly or indirectly, on  account of their protected characteristics, including race, ethnicity, nationality or socioeconomic  background. AI systems should be subject to mandatory testing before and after deployment so that  any discriminatory impact can be identified and addressed. AI systems which cannot adhere to this  minimum standard should have no place in the criminal justice system. \r\nAI systems need to be transparent and explainable, so they can be understood and scrutinised by their  primary users, suspects and accused persons, and the general public. Commercial or proprietary  interests should never be a barrier to transparency. AI systems must be designed in a way that allows  criminal defendants to understand and contest the decisions made against them. It should be possible  to carry out an independent audit of each AI system, and its processes should be reproducible for that  purpose. \r\nMember States should have laws that govern how AI systems are relied upon in criminal proceedings,  and there must be adequate safeguards to prevent over-reliance on AI by decision-makers, to prevent  discrimination and to ensure scrutiny and effective challenge by the defence.  \r\nProcedural safeguards should actively tackle automation-bias amongst criminal justice decision makers. Examples include:  \r\na) making it a legal requirement for decision-makers to be adequately alerted and informed  about the risks associated with AI systems; \r\nb) making AI systems\u2019 assessments intelligible to decision-makers; \r\nc) requiring decision-makers to provide full, individualised reasoning for all decisions influenced  by an AI system; and \r\nd) making it easy for decision-makers to overrule AI assessments that produce unfavourable  outcomes for defendants.  \r\nCriminal justice procedures should ensure that defendants are notified if an AI system has been used  which has or may have influenced a decision taken about them at any point in the criminal justice \r\n\r\nsystem, from investigation to arrest, from charge to conviction, and sentence. Procedures should  enable the full disclosure of all aspects of AI systems that are necessary for suspects and accused  persons to contest their findings. Disclosure should be in a form which is clear and comprehensible to  a layperson, without the need for technical or expert assistance, in order to ensure fairness, equality  of arms, and to discharge the obligations to provide all relevant information and be given reasons for  decisions under the right to a fair trial. Suspects and accused persons should also be given effective  access to technical experts who can help to analyse and challenge otherwise incomprehensible  aspects of AI systems. Training should be made available to all primary users of AI systems, and to  criminal defence practitioners, so that there is greater awareness of AI technology, and of the risks of  over-reliance on AI.  \r\nEffective regulation of AI systems should be facilitated by a governance and monitoring framework.  AI systems should not be deployed unless they have undergone an independent public impact  assessment with the involvement of appropriate experts, that is specific both to the purpose for which  the AI system is deployed, and the locality where it is deployed. A requirement of the assessment  should be a consideration of whether it is necessary to use AI in the particular use case, or whether  an alternative solution could achieve the same aims.  \r\nAs far as it is possible to do so, AI systems should also be tested for impact pre-deployment, a part of  which should be the minimum requirement to prove that the AI system has no discriminatory impact,  either directly or indirectly, before it can be deployed. AI systems should be kept under regular review  post-deployment. Effective monitoring of AI systems is not possible unless there is sufficient data that  makes it possible to discern their real impact. In particular, Member States need to collect data that  allow them to identify discriminatory impacts of AI systems, including discrimination on the basis of  race and ethnicity. \r\n\r\nBackground \r\nRapid technological advancements in recent years have made artificial intelligence (\u2018AI\u2019) an  increasingly prominent aspect of our lives.  \r\nThere are differences of opinion as to the definition of AI and its true meaning, but for the purposes  of this paper we are broadly referring to automated decision-making systems based on algorithms,  including machine-learning, which are used in the criminal justice system. \r\nThere is little doubt that AI has great capacity to increase human potential and improve the lives of  many, but the increasing role of AI in assisting important public functions has also highlighted serious  risks and challenges. If not subject to proper regulation and oversight, AI can threaten fundamental  human rights and, far from expanding human potential, it can amplify and worsen harmful aspects of  our society, including inequality and injustice.  \r\nThis challenge is particularly evident where AI has been used to assist the administration of justice in  criminal cases. In recent years, more and more jurisdictions across the world have begun to use AI  technology to inform and assist policing and judicial decisions, often driven by perceptions about the  reliability and impartiality of technological solutions, and pressures to make cost-savings in policing  and court services. In some countries, algorithmic processes can influence which geographic  neighbourhoods should be subject to increased law enforcement and when, as well as which  individuals should be specifically targeted by law enforcement. They can help to determine whether  someone should be arrested, whether they should be charged with a criminal offence, whether they  should be detained in prison before trial and, if convicted and sentenced, the length of their sentence.  AI is being used more and more to influence highly sensitive, high impact decisions that have far reaching, long-term implications for individuals\u2019 rights.  \r\nResearch emerging from the United States, where the use of AI in criminal justice is particularly  widespread, and from the United Kingdom and some EU Member States, however, seriously questions  whether AI has a positive influence on criminal justice systems. AI tools and systems have been found  to actively generate discriminatory criminal justice outcomes, they have been found to have little to  no positive influence on the quality of human decisions, and they have been criticised for poor design,  that does not reflect or give effect to human rights standards. These criticisms might not be justified  for all AI systems, but these studies highlight the need for much stronger regulatory frameworks to  govern the use of AI.  \r\nWe believe that unless it is subject to robust regulation, it is unlikely that AI can be used in criminal  justice systems without undermining the right to a fair trial. In some cases, it should be restricted from  use entirely. \r\nEU Member States should be encouraged to take a much more cautious approach to AI and subject  automated processes to more stringent rules that are designed to ensure human rights compliance. \r\nThere is the potential for AI systems, if properly and robustly regulated, to have a positive impact on  criminal justice system, advancing human rights, for example, by analysing law enforcement or judicial  decisions to identify patterns of erroneous or poor decision-making, or discrimination.  \r\nThe EU is already a world leader on AI regulation, having adopted ground-breaking data protection  laws in recent years to shield individuals from automated decisions that have an adverse effect on  their rights. We welcome the EU\u2019s commitment to build further on existing legal standards, and we  emphasise that addressing the impact of AI on criminal justice has to be a primary consideration for  EU policy makers when deciding on appropriate legal standards. Discussions around the impact of AI\r\n\r\non human rights have largely been centred on data protection, the right to privacy, and broader  questions of ethics and human dignity. However, despite the increasing use of AI systems in criminal  justice systems across the world, only limited discussions have so far focused on how these systems  impact the right to a fair trial, and what regulations are needed to address that impact.  \r\nAbout this paper \r\nFair Trials has produced this policy paper to highlight the need for EU-wide standards on the regulation  of AI in criminal justice, and to inform EU policy makers about the standards and safeguards needed  to ensure effective protection of fair trial rights where criminal justice decisions are assisted by AI.  \r\nThe EU Commission recognised that AI represents risks for fundamental rights, including the right to  a fair trial, in its 2020 White Paper, \u2018On Artificial Intelligence \u2013 A European approach to excellence and  trust\u2019. It also recognised the need for improvements to the EU\u2019s legislative framework on AI, noting in  particular the challenges in the \u2018effective application and enforcement of existing EU and national  legislation\u2019 and the \u2018limitations of scope of existing EU legislation\u2019.  \r\nIn this paper, we identify the most common fair trial rights issues raised by existing AI systems, based  on examples and experiences from the EU, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We also offer  examples of practical legal and policy solutions that could help to address these challenges, and to  assist in the effective implementation of the EU\u2019s fundamental rights standards in this area. We  recognise that the use of AI has a broader impact on human rights beyond the right to a fair trial, and  that there are important social and ethical issues that also need to be addressed. However, we have  narrowed the focus of this paper given Fair Trials\u2019 mission and field of expertise. \r\nThis paper should not be treated as an exhaustive list of fair trial rights standards that need to be  introduced. AI is used in many ways in criminal justice systems cross the world and, as the technology  continues to develop, it is likely that we will eventually see the deployment of AI technology in ways  never imagined before. This paper focuses primarily on AI systems that carry out individualised risk  assessments, given that these types of systems have had the most significant impact on individuals\u2019  rights so far, and we envisage that similar systems will become increasingly common in the near  future. \r\n\r\nExisting EU Legal Framework \r\nExisting EU laws restrict the use of automated decisions in a wide variety of contexts. Article 22 of the  General Data Protection Regulation (\u2018GDPR\u2019) provides that data subjects have the right not to be  subject to decisions \u2018solely\u2019 based on automated processes, where they produce \u2018legal effects\u2019  concerning them, or where they \u2018similarly significantly affect\u2019 them. The Law Enforcement Directive  (\u2018LED\u2019) \u2013 the EU data legislation that governs the processing of data for criminal justice purposes \u2013 has  a very similar provision at Article 11, which requires Member States to prohibit decisions based solely  on automated processing, where they produce \u2018adverse legal effects\u2019 on the individual, or effects that  are \u2018similarly significant\u2019.  \r\nHowever, there are two notable gaps in the existing legislative framework governing automated  decision-making systems under both the GDPR and the LED. These ambiguities and potential  loopholes could be exploited in ways that seriously undermine the general prohibition of automated  decision-making processes, and adversely impact human rights. It is necessary, therefore, that the EU  provides further guidance on how these provisions should be interpreted, including thorough  legislation (if appropriate) to further clarify the circumstances in which Member States are allowed to  deploy AI systems for criminal justice proceedings.  \r\nFirstly, the provisions in the GDPR and LED only prohibit decisions based \u2018solely\u2019 on automated  processes. In other words, the laws regulate the impact of decisions made through automated  processing, but not the AI systems themselves. As discussed later in this paper, the main human rights  challenges of AI systems can be attributed to how they are designed and trained, and the types of  technology used, such as machine-learning, so it is crucial that decisions about the design and  deployment of AI systems are also regulated.  \r\nSecondly, neither the GDPR or LED provide regulatory standards to govern situations where  automated processing is not the \u2018sole\u2019 basis of a decision, but a primary influencer. In reality, the  difference between a fully automated decision and a decision made with a \u2018human-in-the-loop\u2019 is not  always clear, but because of this strict classification, AI systems are able to be used and have significant  legal effects without the corresponding safeguards. Stronger legal standards are needed to make sure  that semi-automated decision-making processes do not become de facto automated processes. \r\nThirdly, the prohibition on automated decision-making is subject to two very broad exceptions.  Automated decisions are prohibited under the GDPR and LED, \u2018unless authorised by Union or Member  State law\u2019 and there need to be \u2018appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data  subject, at least the right to obtain human intervention\u2019.1 These provisions give extremely wide  discretion to Member States to override the general prohibition. It is significant that EU laws  emphasise the need for human rights safeguards, and the need to ensure the possibility of human  interventions, but neither of these concepts have yet been adequately defined. Although influential  actors like the EU and the Council of Europe have established principles on the ethical and responsible  use of AI, there is currently no authoritative guidance on the practical safeguards that need to be in  place.2Likewise, the meaning of \u2018human intervention\u2019 is open to interpretation. LED provides some  guidance on who should be carrying out the human intervention,3 but there needs to be greater clarity  on what meaningful human intervention entails in different contexts. \r\nIn order to regulate the use of AI in criminal justice proceedings, and close the gaps in existing data  protection laws, the EU must, at a minimum, set standards to address the following questions: \r\n1) what standards are needed to govern the design and deployment of AI systems in criminal  justice systems;  \r\n2) what safeguards are needed in criminal justice proceedings to make sure that AI systems are  used in accordance with human rights standards and prevent discrimination; and  3) how Member States should govern the deployment of AI systems and monitor their  subsequent use.\r\n\r\nPart 1: Regulating the Design and Deployment of AI Systems in Criminal Justice Systems \r\nAI systems deployed to assist criminal justice decision-making have to be fit-for-purpose. The purposes  of AI systems differ depending on the context in which they are deployed, but there are a few common  considerations that need to be taken into account to determine whether it is appropriate for the AI  system to be used.  \r\nFirstly, AI systems have to be designed to produce outcomes that are desirable from a human rights  and non-discrimination perspective. This means that rather than being exclusively focused on  delivering \u2018accurate\u2019 outcomes in criminal cases, AI systems have to be designed to facilitate fair,  impartial and non-discriminatory criminal processes. Developers of AI systems and public entities that  commission them should, in particular, make sure that AI systems are consciously designed to give  effect to, and promote the right to fair trial. The fundamental issues with the way AI systems are  designed and built, resulting in discriminatory outcomes, must also be considered. Given the  significant evidence of AI systems influencing discriminatory outcomes, special efforts must be made  to ensure that AI systems do not produce discriminatory outcomes.  \r\nSecondly, AI systems need to be designed in a way that makes it possible for criminal defendants and  the broader public to scrutinise them. This means that AI systems should not only be made open to  scrutiny (rather than concealed to protect commercial interests), but their inner workings and  processes should also be discernible and comprehensible.  \r\nAI Systems should be designed to protect and promote the right to a fair trial \r\nWhere AI systems are used to assist or inform criminal justice decisions, they support an important  act of public administration that has a significant impact on the rights of suspects and accused persons.  AI systems do more than just provide outputs that decision-makers can take into consideration as  evidence. By attempting to mimic human analytical processes and reasoning, they can provide  influential advisory input into human decision-making, or even replace it altogether. As such, it is right  that human rights standards that govern criminal justice decision-making also apply to AI systems. \r\nThe Council of Europe and the EU Commission\u2019s High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (\u2018AI  HLEG\u2019) have both recognised that fundamental rights should be a key guiding principle for the design  and deployment of AI systems.4 The Council of Europe recommends that AI systems are built according  to \u2018human rights by design\u2019 principles, and recognises that AI systems should not undermine the right  to a fair trial under the European Convention on Human Rights (\u2018ECHR\u2019). The AI HLEG has similarly  recognised that the respect for fundamental rights, as enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental  Rights and international human rights instruments, should form the foundations of trustworthy AI. AI  HLEG\u2019s Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI (\u2018the Ethics Guidelines\u2019) also recognise the need for AI  systems to comply with other types of EU legislation. Although not mentioned explicitly in the Ethics  Guidelines, Fair Trials would emphasise that the design of AI systems and the ways in which they are  deployed in the EU should, in particular, be compatible with the standards set out in the procedural rights directives under the \u2018Roadmap for strengthening procedural rights of suspected or accused  persons in criminal proceedings\u2019.5 \r\nWe would also like to note the potential for AI systems to have a positive impact on criminal justice  systems. Public debate about the relationship between AI and human rights have predominantly been  centred on the idea that AI is a threat to human rights. It is equally important, as technology takes an  increasingly prominent role in public life, to consider what positive potential they may have. Policy \r\nmakers, developers, civil society activists, and other stakeholders should try to identify ways in which  AI can also play an active role in advancing human rights, and improve the fairness of criminal justice  systems. For example, AI systems could be used to analyse law enforcement or judicial decisions to  identify patterns of erroneous or poor decision-making, or discrimination, for preventative purposes.  \r\nAI systems which are used as part of criminal justice decision-making should be designed not just to  ensure that they do not undermine the right to a fair trial, but also to promote it. However, as  explained below, given the embedded biases in the criminal data used to develop and train AI systems,  there are serious doubts, based on recent studies, whether AI systems can promote fair criminal  justice at all.  \r\nThere are various aspects of the right to a fair trial and, without speculating on what kind of AI systems  will be developed in the future to support criminal justice decision-making, it is difficult to articulate  how fair trial rights standards should inform the design of AI systems. However, examples of AI  systems currently deployed in the EU and elsewhere suggest that there are certain aspects of the right  to a fair trial that require special attention. These are: \r\na) the right of access to court \r\nb) the presumption of innocence; \r\nc) the principle of the equality of arms; and  \r\nd) the right to liberty.  \r\nAccess to Court \r\nThe notion of AI systems replacing courts to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused may  seem far-fetched at present, but there is a growing trend of automated administration of justice across  the world that might threaten the right of access to court. For example, in several European countries,  speeding and other minor traffic offences have been detected and enforced by means of automated  processes for more than a decade.6 Although nominally criminal processes, these types of proceedings  are, in reality, normally administrative in nature, and they rarely have a \u2018significant\u2019 impact on the  rights of individuals. However, as surveillance technology develops, thanks to AI, there is a real  likelihood that the scope of crimes punishable by way of automation will increase.7 \r\nIn the United Kingdom, the government announced plans in 2017 that would enable defendants to  enter guilty pleas via an online portal after viewing the charges and evidence against them, for a small number of minor offences.8 Under this procedure, known as \u2018automatic online conviction\u2019, defendants  would be automatically convicted and fined without any judicial oversight if they accept the charges  against them. Although it is debatable whether this system can truly be characterised as an AI system,  it is an example of the automated administration of criminal justice, that replaces a function usually  played by courts.  \r\nIt is worrying that the UK government has proposed expanding this scheme to other \u2018non imprisonable\u2019 offences, if itis regarded as a success.9Fair Trials has outlined concerns about expanding  the scope of cases where accused persons can be convicted without judicial oversight, even if such  procedures are reserved solely for minor, non-imprisonable offences.10 The impacts of a criminal  conviction, even for a minor offence, can be numerous, long-term, and hard to predict, affecting inter  alia job prospects, educational opportunities, and immigration status. It is crucial that what amounts  to \u2018legal effects\u2019 and \u2018similar significant effects\u2019 concerning the data subject for the purposes of  automated decision-making are interpreted very broadly.11 In particular, given that a criminal record  always has a \u2018legal\u2019 or \u2018significant\u2019 effect, any automated decision-making process that directly results  in a criminal record should be prohibited.  \r\nAI systems should not undermine the right to be tried by an impartial and independent tribunal,  and in line with existing EU laws, no individual should be subject to an automated decision that  resultsin their being held in custody or detention, gives them a criminal record, or which determines  a criminal sentence or sanction. No individual should be subject to an automated decision which  engages their human rights without meaningful human input. \r\nPresumption of Innocence \r\nThe right to be presumed innocent in criminal proceedings is a basic human right, and one that is  expressly recognised in, and safeguarded by EU law under Directive 2016/343 (the \u2018Presumption of  Innocence Directive\u2019).12 The increasing use of AI in the sphere of criminal justice, however, raises  questions about the scope of this right, and how AI systems should be built and used to protect it.  Concerns about how AI systems undermine the presumption of innocence have been voiced in the  context of certain types of predictive policing software.13 \r\nA variety of predictive policing tools that aim to facilitate preventative policing measures and to deter  crimes before they have taken place have been developed and deployed across Europe.14 Tools which  predict the time and place where certain crimes are likely to take place have been used in many European countries. Similar tools have also been developed to identify potential suspects, which are  used widely in the US, and now increasingly in Europe.15 \r\nAn example is the \u2018Strategic Subject List\u2019 in Chicago, a police database of around 400,000 local  residents who were assigned threat scores that determine the likelihood that they will commit  crimes.16 The algorithms used to generate these scores were not open to the public, so the exact  process by which individual risk levels were assessed were not known. Despite this lack of  transparency, it is clear that threat scores generated by the software had significant impacts on  individuals\u2019 rights \u2013 in particular, their right to privacy. Individuals with higher threat scores were, for  example, more likely to be subject to targeted police surveillance, or home visits \u2013 as though they  were officially recognised as predisposed to commit crimes, irrespective of any credible suspicion of  wrongdoing.17 The Strategic Subject List was decommissioned in January 2020 by the Chicago police  who cited ineffectiveness as the primary reason for the decision.18 \r\nThese types of predictive policing tools are now being used in Europe. In the United Kingdom, a  coalition of police forces have been developing a system not dissimilar to the Strategic Subject List,  that aims to identify individuals who are likely to commit crimes.19 Known as the National Data  Analytics Solution (\u2018NDAS\u2019), this risk assessment tool uses statistical analysis and machine-learning to  inform policing decisions, and to facilitate \u2018early interventions\u2019 where appropriate.20 The sources of  data that the system uses to conduct its risk assessments raise concerns that the system will be built  to profile individuals on the basis of very sensitive, personal information, including stop and search  data, data from social services, and the National Health Service.21 Where this data is used to indicate  the likelihood of individuals\u2019 criminality, it will inevitably flag up people whose profiles fit those who are over-represented in that data as being higher risk. It is particularly worrying that an individual  might be profiled for policing purposes on the basis of their health conditions or their access to  essential services, such as welfare or benefits. These factors should not be regarded as relevant factors  for determining whether someone may commit criminal offences. \r\nAlso in the UK, the Metropolitan Police in London operates a database called the Gangs Matrix, which  contains information and risk-assessments on individuals who are alleged \u2018gang\u2019 members.22 This  database was created using criminal justice data, including police and crime records. The Gangs Matrix  and the assessments it produces assists policing decisions, including the deployment of stop and  search, and further enforcement action, such as imprisonment and deportation. A further tactic  resulting from the risk assessments made by the Gangs Matrix is the threat of eviction or exclusion from education, as names and details of these alleged gang members have been shared with education, healthcare and housing providers.23 \r\nIn the Netherlands, the government has been running an algorithmic risk assessment tool, ProKid 12- SI, which purports to assess the risk of criminality of 12-year-old children since 2009.24 ProKid uses  existing police data on these children, such as reports of where children have come into contact with  the police, their addresses, information about their \u2018living environment\u2019, even including whether they  are victims of violence, to identify them as being in one of four categories of \u2018risk\u2019 of committing crimes in future.25 The system assesses children based on their relationships with other people and their  supposed risk levels, meaning that individuals can be deemed higher risk by being linked to another  individual with a high risk assessment, such as a sibling or a friend.26 Parents\u2019 assessed risk can also  impact a child\u2019s risk level. ProKid\u2019s algorithms assess risks in relation to future actions that the children  have not yet carried out, and judges them on the basis of the actions of others close to them.27 These  risk assessments result in police \u2018registering\u2019 these children on their systems and monitoring them,  and then referring them to youth \u2018care\u2019 services.28 ProKid frames children as potential perpetrators  even when they are registered as victims of violence; which has serious implications on their presumption of innocence.29 \r\nSeveral similar tools are also used in the Netherlands, including the Reference Index for High Risk  Youth, a large-scale risk assessment system that focuses on assessing under-23-year-olds.30 \r\nPredictive policing tools like NDAS, ProKid and the Gangs Matrix can be regarded as part of a broader  trend in law enforcement that moves away from \u2018reactive\u2019 policing, and towards \u2018preventative\u2019 or  \u2018proactive\u2019 policing.31 NDAS and other similar predictive policing tools intend to pursue legitimate  objectives of preventing, or reducing harm,32 but there are serious concerns that these systems single out individuals as \u2018pre-criminals\u2019, who are subject to police interventions even though they are not  formally suspected of any crime, and there is no evidence that they have done anything wrong.33 It is  of further concern that these types of predictive policing tools do not necessarily designate individuals\u2019  risk levels on the basis of their past actions, or behaviour that can be regarded as \u2018suspicious\u2019 in any way, but on account of factors far beyond their control, and immutable characteristics. In particular,  there is strong evidence to suggest that AI systems have a tendency to overestimate the risks of  criminality of certain ethnic and racial groups. For example, out of 3,800 people on the Gangs Matrix,  80% are 12-24 years old, and 78% of them are black \u2013 a clearly disproportionate and discriminatory proportion. The discriminatory impact of AI in criminal justice systems is discussed in further detail in  the following section. \r\nAlthough predictive policing tools do not directly \u2018convict\u2019 people, they not only allow the police to  treat legally innocent individuals as pseudo-criminals, but they can also result individuals being  deprived of their basic rights with regard to education, housing, and other public services \u2013 effectively  \u2018punishing\u2019 them on account of their profiles. This seriously damages the fundamental human rights  principle that the matter of guilt or innocence can only be determined by means of a fair and lawful  criminal justice process.34 \r\nWhile it is clear that certain types of predictive policing can infringe the presumption of innocence  from a moral and ethical viewpoint, it is debatable whether these systems also violate the legal  presumption of innocence under EU law and international human rights law. The Presumption of  Innocence Directive applies to natural persons who are \u2018suspects\u2019 and \u2018accused persons\u2019, from the  moment they are suspected or accused of a crime.35 However, there is some ambiguity about the  exact stage at which an individual attains the status of a \u2018suspect\u2019 under the Presumption of Innocence  Directive,36 and about whether the scope of the Presumption of Innocence Directive extends to  decisions to designate an individual as a suspect (or a \u2018pre-criminal\u2019). On the other hand, the ECHR appears to have taken a clearer position that measures undertaken pre-charge, as a general rule, fall  outside the scope of the presumption of innocence.37 It has also held that preventative measures, such  as surveillance, do not amount to criminal sanctions for the purposes of Article 6 ECHR.38 \r\nEven if the current language on the presumption of innocence is such that it is not directly applicable  to the predictive policing context, it must be recognised that these tools nevertheless interfere with  human rights. In particular, the targeted surveillance that results from predictive policing has clear  implications on the right to privacy. The acceptable degree to which criminal justice processes can  interfere with this right is a matter that might require clearer articulation, as is the question of the  impact of Article 8 ECHR violations on criminal proceedings.  \r\nAI systems that inform charging decisions have also been developed and deployed. An example of this  is the Harm Assessment Risk Tool (\u2018HART\u2019) currently being used by Durham Constabulary in the United  Kingdom. HART uses a machine-learning algorithm to assess a suspect\u2019s risk of reoffending, using over  thirty variables that characterise an individual\u2019s criminal history and socio-demographic background.  The risk assessments conducted by HART are used by the local police to determine whether an  individual should be charged, or diverted into a rehabilitation programme. HART does not determine  whether an individual is guilty or innocent, but its assessment can trigger a chain of events that can  result in the deprivation of liberty, and/or a criminal conviction. Charging decisions should surely be  based on the merits of individual cases, and it is difficult to imagine how decisions on entry into  diversion programmes can be made by means other than a careful consideration of individual circumstances. These types of high impact, fact-sensitive decisions should never be delegated to  automated processes, particularly those which operate by identifying correlations rather than causal  links between an individual\u2019s characteristics and their likely behaviour.  \r\nAn examination of HART also reveals flaws in how the tool is designed. HART is calibrated to err on  the side of caution,39 because it regards under-estimations of risk levels as a more serious error than  over-estimations, so that under-estimations occur less frequently. In other words, HART is deliberately  designed to underestimate who is eligible for entry into the diversion programme, so it is predisposed  to over-criminalise. This approach conflicts with the notion that any doubt in a criminal case should  be interpreted in favour of the defendant (\u2018in dubio reo\u2019).40 A human rights compliant approach to  criminal justice decision-making would do the opposite of what HART does \u2013 it would need to err on  the side of the defendant.  \r\nAI systems should respect the presumption of innocence and they must be designed so that they do  not pre-designate an individual as a criminal before trial, nor should they allow or assist the police  to take unjustified, disproportionate measures against individuals without reasonable suspicion. AI  systems that inform criminal justice outcomes should, as a general rule, favour outcomes that are  favourable to the defendant. \r\nEquality of Arms \r\nA major concern raised in the studies of certain AI systems is that they are inaccessible for adequate  scrutiny by defendants and their lawyers. This has serious implications for the principle of equality of  arms and the right to an adversarial process, because without information about how a decision is  made, it is difficult to envisage how defendants can question the accuracy and legality of the decision.  The need for AI systems used in criminal justice to be transparent, explainable and understandable to  all is addressed in more detail below. \r\nThe Right to Liberty \r\nIn the United States, \u2018risk-assessment\u2019 tools that use AI technology have been used to assist pre-trial  assessments that determine whether a defendant should be released on bail, or held on remand pending their trial. Examples of risk-assessment tools currently being used in the United States include  COMPAS, the Public Safety Assessment (\u2018PSA\u2019), and the Federal Pre-Trial Risk Assessment Instrument  (\u2018PTRA\u2019). Many of these tools are also used to inform decisions on parole and sentencing.  \r\nThese tools have, however, been subject to intense criticism for several reasons. Studies have shown  inter alia that risk assessments make inaccurate predictions that are no better than those made by  non-expert humans. They do not result in a significant reduction in pre-trial detention rates, and that  they produce disparate outcomes for different racial groups. The US-based NGO Partnership on AI has  found that AI risk assessment tools currently being used in the United States are unfit for use in pre trial assessments, and it has recommended that policymakers cease the deployment of risk  assessment tools until such time that the challenges affecting such tools have been adequately  addressed.41 \r\nThe adoption of pre-trial risk-assessments tools in the United States has largely been driven by the  desire to address high imprisonment rates in the country by making pre-trial decision-making fairer.  \r\nIn particular, these tools have been promoted as an alternative to cash bail \u2013 a system often criticised  for disadvantaging poorer defendants and worsening social injustices.42 Cash bail is a relatively rare  concept in the EU, but there are concerns about the quality of pre-trial detention decisions in many  Member States, which have been criticised for failing to carry out case-specific reviews and fully  consider alternatives to detention.43  \r\nWe are currently unaware of any attempts in EU Member States to introduce algorithmic risk  assessments to supplement or replace existing pre-trial decision-making processes. However, it is  possible that risk-assessment tools will also be recommended as a solution to address the pre-trial  detention challenge in Europe, especially given that many of these tools are developed by private  companies that actively market their products to governments and local police forces.  \r\nRisk-assessment tools are usually designed to assess the likelihood of re-arrest, and/or of failure to  turn up to court after being released based on the profiles of the defendant. Based on these  assessments, risk assessment tools either assign risk levels to defendants, or they provide direct advice  to decision-makers on whether or not the defendant should be released. There is only limited research  about the extent to which pre-trial risk-assessment tools influence judges\u2019 decisions in practice,44 but  concerns have been raised about the ability of AI systems to recommend detention at all.45 There is a  risk that recommendations made by AI systems to detain individuals compromise the presumption of  release. This is a particularly valid concern in light of research suggesting that decision-makers have a  tendency to err on the side of caution when they are \u2018advised\u2019 by AI systems, and that they have a  greater propensity to override risk assessment tools to detain, rather than release defendants.46 Pre trial detention should always be a measure of last resort, and no risk-assessment can be regarded as  human rights compliant, unless it recommends its users to consider detention as a measure of last  resort, after all other alternatives have been fully considered. \r\nPre-trial risk assessment tools in the United States and elsewhere have also been criticised for  (unintentionally) over-estimating risks, because of the nature of the data used to train its algorithms.  \r\nPre-trialrisk assessment tools typically rely only on data regarding individuals who have been released,  and they ignore those who were detained, but would have otherwise \u2018succeeded\u2019 by not being  arrested, and by appearing in court.47 In other words, algorithms are based on the assumption that  individuals who have been detained by courts in the past have been rightfully deprived of their liberty.  Any AI system developed to assist pre-trial detention decision-making must be designed to give effect  to the presumption in favour of release. This means that risk-assessment tools need to be deliberately  calibrated to generate outcomes that favourable to the defendant. Data used to train the AI system  should be carefully scrutinised so that it reflects the inevitable fact that a significant proportion of  individuals in pre-trial detention have been deprived of their liberty in violation of their human rights.\r\nStudies of pre-trial risk-assessment tools used in the United States cast doubt on their effectiveness  at reducing pre-trial detention rates, and their ability to make accurate predictions of risks. A study in  Kentucky, for example, found that the likelihood of defendants being released within the first three  days of their arrest went down after the risk-assessment tool was deployed, and that there were no  significant changes in the number of re-arrests and failure-to-appear rates amongst defendants  released on bail during the same period.48 This was the case even after the risk-assessment tool was  modified post-deployment to improve the accuracy of predictions. Another study has found that the  COMPAS risk-assessment tool is no better at predicting the likelihood of defendants reoffending than  non-expert human volunteers.49 These studies do not necessarily prove that AI systems are incapable  of reducing pre-trial detention rates at all, but they do raise questions about their usefulness, and they  strongly challenge claims that algorithmic risk-assessment tools help to improve the quality of pre trial detention decisions. They also highlight the need for post-deployment testing and monitoring of  AI systems, to ensure that they have the desired effect of ensuring that individuals are detained only  as a measure of last resort. \r\nPost-trial assessment systems are also being increasingly used, for purposes such as assisting with sentencing decisions or prisoner release. \r\nIn England and Wales, the Prison and Probation Service has developed and operates the Offender  Assessment System (OASys), an automated risk-assessment tool.50 It assesses the risk of harm  offenders pose to others and how likely an offender is to reoffend, as well as assessing offender needs.  These risk assessments are used to decide \u2018interventions\u2019 and to influence the sentence plans given  to offenders.51 Millions of these assessments have been carried out.52 The system collates information  on offenders\u2019 previous offences, education, training, employment, alcohol and drug misuse; as well as  their \u2018attitudes\u2019, \u2018thinking and behaviour\u2019, \u2018relationships\u2019, and \u2018lifestyle\u2019.53 This data is used alongside  the individual\u2019s offending record and \u2018offender demographic information\u2019 to inform two predictive  algorithms: OASys General Reoffending Predictor (OGP1) and OASys Violence Predictor (OVP1).54 A  2014 National Offender Management Service analysis found that the OGP1 and OVP1 generated  different predictions based on race and gender. They found that relative predictive validity was better  for white offenders than for Asian, black, or mixed ethnicity offenders. The Offender Group  Reconviction Scale (OGRS) is another algorithmic risk assessment tool, which is used in England and  Wales to assess and predict an offender\u2019s likelihood of reoffending.55 The OGRS algorithm uses data on the individual\u2019s official criminal history, as well as their age and gender, to produce a risk score  between 0 and 1 of how likely an offender is to reoffend within one or two years. \r\nThe use of these AI systems in a post-trial setting, and the documented differences in predictive  outcomes based on, among other factors, race, highlight the clear need for strict testing and  monitoring of such systems. These systems used in a post-trial setting could very easily be transferred  to a pre-trial risk assessment setting; the principles and aims of these systems and the data used are  very similar. For example, the COMPAS system, mentioned above and considered in more detail  below, was originally designed as a recidivism risk assessment tool, and is also used as a pre-trial risk  assessment tool. 56 \r\nWhere AI systems inform decisions on the deprivations of liberty, they should be calibrated to  generate outcomes that favour release, and they should not facilitate detention other than as a  measure of last resort. AI systems must be subject to rigorous testing to ensure they have the  desired effect of reducing rates of pre-trial detention rates. \r\nAI systems should be designed to be non-discriminatory \r\nOne of the most frequent criticisms of AI systems and their use in criminal justice systems is that they  can lead to discriminatory outcomes, especially along racial and ethnic lines.  \r\nThe best-known example of this is a study by the US media outlet ProPublica into COMPAS, a risk assessment tool designed to predict the likelihood of reoffending in Broward County in Florida.  ProPublica found that COMPAS was 77% more likely to rate black defendants as \u2018high-risk\u2019 than white  defendants, and it was almost twice as likely to mislabel white defendants as lower risk than black  defendants.57 \r\nThe dangers of the failure to adequately regulate the use of AI to prevent discrimination have also  been witnessed in Europe. The \u2018Crime Anticipation System\u2019 (\u2018CAS\u2019), a predictive policing software  being used across the Netherlands, was initially designed to consider ethnicity as a relevant factor for  determining the likelihood of a crime being committed. Amongst the indicators used by CAS to predict  crimes in a particular area was the number of \u2018non-Western allochtones\u2019 in the area \u2013 in other words,  \u2018non-Western\u2019 individuals with at least one foreign-born parent.58 The software not only presupposed  the existence of a correlation between ethnicity and crime, but also singled out a category of  ethnicities to be of particular concern, given that the presence of \u2018Western\u2019, \u2018autochtone\u2019 individuals  were not used as indicators. Furthermore, given that \u2018Western\u2019 was defined somewhat subjectively  (for example, including individuals of Japanese or Indonesian origin, and including all European  nationalities, apart from Turkish), CAS incorporated highly questionable societal categorisations and  biases. \r\nIn the United Kingdom, a major criticism of HART has been that it included data collated and classified  by a private company for marketing purposes that could very easily to biased outcomes. HART relied  on the \u2018Mosaic\u2019 code developed by a consumer credit reporting company, that categorised individuals  into various groups according to inter alia their ethnic origin, income, and education levels. It was of particular concern that some socio-demographic categories used by Mosaic were blatantly racialised,  including, for example, \u2018Asian Heritage\u2019, which stereotyped individuals of \u2018Asian\u2019 origin as being  unemployed or having low-paid jobs, and living with extended families.59 \r\nIn Denmark, an automated algorithmic assessment has been used to classify different  neighbourhoods, based on criteria such as unemployment, crime rates, educational attainment, and  other \u2018risk indicators\u2019, as well as whether the levels of first and second-generation migrants in the  population is more than 50%. Neighbourhoods which meet these criteria are classified as \u2018ghettos\u2019.  These neighbourhoods are then subject to special measures, including higher punishments for  crimes.60 It is clearly discriminatory, as well as entirely unfair, for people living in certain areas to be  punished more severely than others in different areas for the same crimes. \r\nFurther examples of criminal justice AI which have been identified as producing discriminatory  outcomes include the previously mentioned OASys, NDAS and the Gangs Matrix in the UK, and the  Netherland\u2019s ProKid 12.  \r\nThese examples illustrate the need for regulations to ensure that AI systems are designed to be non discriminatory, and to exclude categorisations and classifications that deepen and legitimise social  biases and stereotypes. However, policy makers should not assume that making AI systems blind to  all protected characteristics will always help to produce non-discriminatory outcomes. In certain  scenarios, the removal of protected characteristics from the data could worsen discrimination. For  example, it has been suggested on the basis of research into COMPAS in the United States, that  excluding gender as a variable for risk assessments would fail to reflect a well-established statistical  fact that in most countries, women are less likely to reoffend than men.61 Making COMPAS gender \r\nblind would unfairly and inaccurately assume women to be as equally likely to reoffend as men, and  discriminate against them by overestimating their risk scores.  \r\nRemoving visible biases from AI systems cannot be the sole or primary solution to their discriminatory  impact, because AI systems can be biased even if they have not been deliberately designed in that  way. Bias is often unintentional, and even if the AI system appears on the surface to be neutral, their  algorithms can lead to discriminatory assessments and outcomes. COMPAS, for example, does not  include race or ethnicity as a variable, yet research has found that it consistently gives black  defendants higher risk scores than their white counterparts, making them less likely to be released  from detention.62 \r\nHidden biases can arise in AI systems in numerous ways. Although a comprehensive analysis of how  they can cause unintentional biases are beyond the scope of this paper,63 the way in which AI systems are themselves created and built illustrate the difficulty, complexity, and sometimes impossibility, in  preventing discriminatory outputs and effects of AI systems.  \r\nThere are fundamental issues with the way AI systems are designed and created which can lead to  bias. Where the AI system is based on machine-learning, biases can result from faults in the data that  is used to train its algorithms. Machine learning systems \u2018learn\u2019 how to make assessments or decisions  on the basis of their analysis of data to which they have previously been exposed. However, the data  used to train a machine learning system might be incomplete, inaccurate, or selected for improper  reasons, and this could lead to AI systems producing unwanted outcomes. What amounts to  appropriate, good quality data for the purpose of training algorithms depends on what the machine  learning system is being designed to do,64 so it might not always be obvious which dataset is needed  to train algorithms to be non-discriminatory. \r\nAI designed or created for use in the criminal justice system will almost inevitably use data which is  heavily reliant on, or entirely from within, the criminal justice system itself, such as policing or crime  records. This data does not represent an accurate record of criminality, but is merely a record of  policing \u2013 the crimes, locations and groups that are policed within that society, rather than the actual  occurrence of crime. The data might not be categorised or deliberately manipulated to yield  discriminatory results, but it may reflect the structural biases and inequalities in the society which the  data represents.  \r\nWhere there are discriminatory policing patterns targeting certain demographics, or the systematic  under-reporting and systematic over-reporting of certain types of crime and in certain locations,65 the  use of such data merely results in a reinforcing and re-entrenching of those inequalities and  discriminationin criminal justice outcomes. For example, according to UK crime data, black people are  over 9 times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people,66 and black men are more  than 3 times more likely to be arrested than white men.67 Despite these statistics, NDAS (mentioned  above) in the United Kingdom explicitly relies on stop and search data to determine an individual\u2019s  propensity to commit a criminal offence. The fact that stop and search is disproportionately used  against black people means that there will inevitably be an overrepresentation of black people in NDAS  and that their risk levels will be inflated in comparison to white people.  \r\nComparable statistics on stop and search are not available in most EU Member States, where the  official collection of racially disaggregated criminal justice data is either forbidden by law, or not  standard practice. However, recent studies show that racially biased policing practices are prevalent  throughout the EU. Data collected from a survey by the Fundamental Rights Agency, for example, has shown that during a 5-year period, 66% of individuals of Sub-Saharan African origin in Austria, and  over half of respondents of South Asian origin in Greece were stopped and searched.68 \r\nAI built on data embedded with such biases and used to assist, inform, or make decisions in the  criminal justice system, can expand and entrench the biases represented in the data.69 When AI  systems result in criminal justice outcomes which repeat the discrimination inherent in the historic  data, such as targeting individuals from a particular demographic, that decision will itself be preserved  in the data. This leads to self-perpetuating \u2018feedback loops\u2019 which reinforce patterns of inequality.70 \r\nAnother way in which AI systems can produce unintentional biases is by way of proxies. Data used by  AI systems might be classified in seemingly legitimate ways, but those classifications can sometimes  act as proxies for protected characteristics. A common example used to illustrate this point is how  home addresses or postcodes can be proxies for race or ethnicity.71 Certain AI systems, such as HART,  were initially trained to find correlations between home addresses and the risk of reoffending \u2013 in  other words, to identify which postcode areas have \u2018higher-risk\u2019 residents than others.72 This approach  overlooks the fact that there is very pronounced ethnic residential segregation in many countries,73 making it highly probable in practice, for AI systems to inadvertently establish a link between ethnic  origin and risk. \r\nRoma are especially vulnerable to this form of proxy discrimination, given that in many EU Member  States, Roma are reported to live primarily in segregated areas inhabited mostly or exclusively by  Roma.74 \r\nThere are several ways in which AI systems can be designed to mitigate the risks of discrimination,  including by identifying and excluding data classifications that act as proxies for protected  characteristics.75 However, it can be difficult in practice to identify which variables are proxies for  protected characteristics (and how they do so), and removing too many \u2018offending\u2019 variables might  result in the AI system losing much of its functional utility.76 There is no one-size-fits-all method of  ensuring that AI systems do not produce discriminatory outcomes. Different approaches to de-biasing  AI systems can conflict with one another, and the suitability of a particular de-biasing method might  depend on the AI tool itself, and the legal and policy context in which it is designed to operate.77 Biases in AI systems are often not easy to detect and, in many cases, it might also be difficult to pinpoint  flaws either in the system itself, or in the training data that has been caused the bias. The structural  bias within the data that AI systems are built and operated on, a bias which is particularly deep-rooted  in criminal justice data, is a fundamental issue, and one which is likely to result in AI systems being  fundamentally inoperable \u2013 both because the bias makes them morally and ethically inoperable, if not  yet legally, and because any attempts to remove the bias will make the data to operate these systems  unusable.  \r\nFair Trials\u2019 view is that the only effective way in which AI systems can be regarded as non discriminatory is if they have been subject to rigorous independent testing for biases. These tests must  be mandated by law, must be independently run, have clearly stated aims or objectives, and be carried  out pre-deployment to reduce the likelihood of individuals being affected by discriminatory profiling  and decisions. AI can be tested in advance of deployment by using test data \u2013 datasets which are either  synthetic datasets,78 or by using historic data with permissions \u2013 running it through an AI system, and  analysing the outputs.79 For example, a trial of retrospective facial recognition video analysis is being  run by a police oversight Ethics Committee in the UK. The trial is using historic data \u2013 CCTV footage \u2013 \r\nas the basis for simulated investigations in a controlled environment, monitored by researchers. The  trial has clearly stated aims and signifiers of success, and all outcomes will be examined. There are  significant human rights, data protection and ethical concerns involved with this particular technology,  including the right to privacy, and the testing is not being conducted independently as it should be but, as above, there are positive aspects of the testing methodology.80 \r\nAn alternative could be to \u2018test\u2019 a system in a strictly academic sense by running it alongside actual  criminal justice processes, but with the system not having any effect on decision-making, and  analysing the system\u2019s proposed decisions or outcomes for bias.  \r\nAI should never be used or even \u2018tested\u2019 in real-world situations where they have actual effects on  individuals or criminal justice outcomes, before they have been tested. These types of tests also need  to be carried out in the broader context of an AI governance framework that not only analyses the  potential impact of the AI system pre-deployment, but also continues to monitor its impact  afterwards. \r\nIf these tests are not carried out, and/or if an AI system cannot be proven to be non-discriminatory, it  should be legally precluded from deployment. However, as explained in the final section of this paper,  it is questionable whether such tests are feasible in many Member States, where local laws prohibit  the collection of racially-disaggregated data.  \r\nAI systems should be developed to generate non-discriminatory outcomes, ensuring that suspects  and accused persons are not disadvantaged, either directly or indirectly, on account of their  protected characteristics, including race or ethnicity. AI systems should be subject to mandatory  testing before and after deployment so that any discriminatory impact can be identified and addressed. If an AI system cannot be proven not to generate discriminatory outcomes, it should not  be used. \r\nAI Systems need to be transparent and explainable \r\nAI systems can have a significant influence over criminal justice decisions, and they should be open to  public scrutiny in the same way that all decision-making processes by public entities should be.  However, a common criticism of many AI systems is that they lack transparency, which often makes it  difficult, if not outright impossible, to subject them to meaningful impartial analysis and criticism. This  lack of transparency is both as a result of deliberate efforts to conceal the inner workings of AI systems  for legal or profit-driven reasons, and of the nature of the technology used to build AI systems that is  uninterpretable for most, if not all humans.  \r\nThere are several reasons why it is necessary for AI systems to be transparent. Firstly, transparency is  essential for strengthening confidence of both primary users of the system, as well as the general  public, in AI systems. Democratic values demand that the public needs to be aware of how powerful  public institutions, such as the police and the judiciary, operate so that they can be held accountable  for their actions. It is also crucial for primary users of AI systems to understand how they work, so that  they can make informed decisions about how much influence they should have on criminal justice  decisions.  \r\nSecondly, decisions made by AI systems need to be contestable at an individual level. Standards on  the right to a fair trial and the right to liberty demand that defendants should have access to materials  that inform decisions regarding them, so that they can challenge the accuracy and lawfulness of those  decisions.  \r\nTransparency also acts as a safeguard against bias and inaccuracies. It is difficult to imagine how issues  that undermine the fairness and accuracies of AI systems (such as racial biases) can be detected, and  ultimately fixed, if they cannot be properly accessed and analysed. As explained above, certain AI  systems, such as CAS, have been found to have serious, but very obvious, flaws. In CAS\u2019s case,  however, the fault in the software could be detected easily, which meant that the discriminatory impact of the tool could be mitigated. The indicator for \u2018non-Western allochtones\u2019 in CAS was removed  in 2017,81 ostensibly because it served no useful purpose, but presumably also because of the very  obvious bias. This mitigation was possible because CAS is a transparent software, that was developed  in-house by the Dutch police. The types of indicators used to predict crime were made openly  available, and information about the method by which the software made predictions could easily be  accessed and understood.82 \r\nThis, however, is not the case for all AI systems, because AI systems are often developed by for-profit companies with little to no meaningful input from the public. As such, details of how they are  designed, and how they make decisions and assessments are, in many cases, closely guarded as trade  secrets that are protected by law.83 Often, AI systems are \u2018black boxes\u2019 because they are deliberately  kept that way. While it is accepted that strong, enforceable intellectual property laws are needed to  promote advancements in what is a very dynamic field of scientific research and innovation, it is not acceptable that these concerns trump the rights of individuals suspected or accused of crimes. In light  of this, it is concerning that the Commission\u2019s White Paper focuses on, and strongly promotes, the  concept of a \u2018partnership between the private and the public sector\u2019 in relation to AI.84 Fair Trials  appreciates that effective public-private collaboration could help to fill in gaps in public sector  expertise and capacity for the development of AI systems, but given the transparency challenges, it is  essential thatsuch partnerships are accompanied by robust regulations and rules that ensure effective  and open scrutiny.  \r\nHowever, even if AI systems are completely exposed to public scrutiny, and their source code85 and  input data, for example, are openly disclosed, there is still no guarantee that they will be sufficiently  transparent to enable adequate independent scrutiny. AI systems can be black boxes by nature of the  technology that makes their decision-making processes complicated beyond comprehension for most  (in some cases, too complicated even for computer scientists to understand).86 This is especially the  case where AI systems are based on machine-learning algorithms.  \r\nOne possible reason for the unintelligibility of AI systems is that they sometimes use machine-learning  algorithms that are simply too complex to be understood to a reasonable degree of precision.87 This  is especially the case where AI systems incorporate \u2018Deep Neural Networks\u2019 \u2013 a machine-learning  algorithmic architecture inspired by the structure and mechanics of human brains. Rather than relying  on a set of man-made instructions, these types of AI systems make decisions based on experience and  learning. Decision-making processes of this kind have been described to be \u2018intuitive\u2019, because they  do not follow a defined logical method, making it impossible to analyse the exact process by which a  particular decision is reached.88 It has also been suggested that some AI systems are uninterpretable  to humans because the machine-learning algorithms that support them are able to identify and rely  on geometric relationships that humans cannot visualise. Certain machine-learning algorithms are  able to make decisions by analysing many variables at once, and by finding correlations and geometric  patterns between them in ways that are beyond the capabilities of human brains.89  \r\nGiven these challenges, there is widespread recognition that states should require AI systems to not  only be \u2018transparent\u2019, but also explainable and intelligible.90 GDPR already recognises that individuals  should have the right to an explanation of how a decision was reached, if they have been subject to  an automated decision.91 In principle, this is an essential and very useful requirement, but it is also  one that seems difficult to implement in practice, given that both \u2018explainability\u2019 and intelligibility are  highly subjective concepts. Arguably, AI systems\u2019 computing processes are inherently difficult to  explain and understand for most people, including for most criminal justice decision-makers, but this  surely should not be the sole basis for oversimplifying the technology, or for banning the use of AI  outright.  \r\nComputer scientists have been theorising different ways of ensuring that decisions made through  complex algorithms can be explained and understood. An example is the \u2018explainable AI\u2019 movement  (\u2018xAI\u2019) that aims to build AI systems that can show more discernible links between inputted data and  decisions. xAI systems measure how each input influences the final decision, so it is possible figure out  how much weight is given to each input.92 This seems to be an innovative response to the \u2018black box\u2019  challenge, establishing clearer, more helpful relationships between inputs and final decisions.  However, it appears to fall short of explaining what happens between data being inputted into the  system and the final decision, and it does not enable users to impute any logic to the decision-making  process.93 \r\nAs explained above, there are various reasons why AI systems need to be transparent and intelligible,  but the effective of exercise of the rights of the defence must be recognised as a crucial test for  determining whether an AI system is sufficiently explainable and intelligible. AI systems have to be  designed in a way that allows criminal defendants to understand and contest the decision made  against them. Partnership for AI has suggested that a central factor that determines the contestability  of AI systems is the possibility of carrying out an audit trail of the AI decision.94 In particular, it has to  be possible for an auditor to follow and reproduce the process and come to the same conclusion  reached by the AI system at the end.  \r\nFurthermore, as explained in further detail below, criminal justice procedures should require the full  disclosure of all aspects of AI systems that are necessary for suspects and accused persons to contest  their findings, and this disclosure should be in a form which is understandable to a layperson, without  the need for technical or expert assistance. \r\nAI systems need to be transparent and explainable, so they can be understood and scrutinised by  their primary users, suspects and accused persons, as well as the general public. Commercial or  proprietary interests, or technical concerns, should never be a barrier to transparency. AI systems  must be designed in a way that allows criminal defendants to understand and contest the decision  made against them. It should be possible to carry out an independent audit, and processes should  be reproducible.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2: Safeguards for the use of AI Systems in Criminal Proceedings \r\nAI systems have to be built in accordance with human rights principles, and to give effect to human  rights in practice, but it is unlikely that their design alone will guarantee that they are used in ways  that comply with human rights. Regulatory frameworks for the design and deployment of AI systems  have to be accompanied by appropriate legal safeguards that ensure they are used responsibly and  lawfully. There are two primary questions that need to be addressed: \r\n1) how procedural rules ensure that decision-makers do not over-rely on AI systems; and 2) how decisions and assessments made by AI systems can be analysed independently and  challenged. \r\nCombatting \u2018Automation Bias\u2019 and Reinforcing Meaningful Human Input \r\nOne of the main challenges of automated, or semi-automated decision-making systems is that of  \u2018automation bias\u2019 \u2013 the tendency to over-rely on automation in ways that can cause errors in decision making. Automation bias occurs primarily due to the perception that automated decision-making  processes are generally trustworthy and reliable. Automated cues have been found to be particularly  salient to decision-makers, and research has shown that users of automated decision-making systems  have a tendency to place greater weight on automated assessments over other sources of advice.95 \r\nThe disproportionate influence of automated systems can undermine the quality of decision-making,  by discouraging its users from consulting a wider range of factors that could inform more accurate  decisions.  \r\nMost AI systems currently being used to assist criminal justice decision-making do not completely  replace human decision-making. They are instead designed and deployed to be used as decision aids,  whose outputs are factored into consideration for the purposes of human decision-making. The  phenomenon of automation bias however, raises questions about whether AI systems are being used  in reality in accordance with their intended purpose as decision aids, and not as de facto replacements  for human decision-making processes.  \r\nThere is strong evidentiary basis for automation bias amongst pilots who, like judges and other  decision-makers in criminal justice proceedings, have typically been through a high level of training to  make appropriate decisions in highly complex settings.96 However, limited research into automation  bias amongst judges suggests that AI systems might have a more complex impact on judges\u2019  behaviour. For example, a study conducted in 2019 in Kentucky seems to suggest that the degree to  which judges rely on predictive tools for pre-trial detention decision-making could be influenced by  the ethnicity of the defendant.97 The research indicates that judges had a greater tendency to rely on  algorithmic risk assessments where the defendant was white, whereas in cases where the defendant  was black, judges were more likely to overrule the risk-assessment in favour of detaining them. This  study appears to show that AI systems can influence judges\u2019 behaviour in unpredictable ways,  especially where there are interactions or conflicts between automation and human biases, and that  AI systems might be an ineffective tool for challenging human prejudices. It is crucial that rules governing the use of AI systems in criminal proceedings actively try to counter  automation bias, and to encourage decision-makers to make independent determinations. A simple  requirement to have a human decision-maker \u2018in the loop\u2019 or to have a human decision-maker review  or check the automated decision is insufficient, because this risks overestimating the capacity or  willingness of human decision-makers to question and overrule automated decisions. A mere requirement to have an automated decision reviewed by a human, on its own, could reduce the  human review into a rubber-stamping exercise which, in practice, is no oversight at all.  \r\nIn recognition of this challenge, the European Data Protection Board has recommended that in order  for decisions to be regarded as not \u2018based solely\u2019 on automated processing for the purposes of Article  22 GDPR, there has to be \u2018meaningful\u2019 human oversight, rather than just a token gesture.98 What  qualifies as \u2018meaningful\u2019 intervention is open to interpretation, and it is likely to differ depending on  the circumstances and the type of decision being made. In the context of criminal justice procedures,  where decisions often have particularly severe and far-reaching implications for individuals\u2019 rights,  safeguards for ensuring meaningful human intervention have to be especially robust. \r\nProcedural safeguards that ensure \u2018meaningful\u2019 human oversight \r\nRules governing the use of AI systems in criminal justice proceedings have to counter automation  bias by encouraging human decision-makers to treat their processes with scepticism, and to force  them to challenge and scrutinise the outcomes of algorithmic assessments.  \r\nProcedural safeguards that can be put in place to tackle automation bias include: \r\na) making it a legal requirement for decision-makers to be adequately alerted and informed  about the risks associated with AI systems; \r\nb) making AI systems\u2019 assessments intelligible to decision-makers; \r\nc) requiring decision-makers to provide full, individualised reasoning for all decisions  influenced by an AI system; and \r\nd) making it easier for decision-makers to overrule AI assessments that produce unfavourable  outcomes for defendants.  \r\nOne way of ensuring that automated assessments and decisions do not have undue influence on  judicial decisions might be to ensure that decision-makers are sufficiently informed and alerted about  the risks of relying on AI systems. This seems to be the approach taken by the Wisconsin Supreme  Court in the United States in the case of Loomis,99 in which the Court considered whether or not the  use of the COMPAS risk assessment tool for sentencing purposes violated due process rights. The  judgment in Loomis recognises the importance of procedural safeguards as a way of safeguarding  fairness of decisions, by requiring the use of \u2018written advisements\u2019 to alert decision-makers about the  potential risks of AI risk assessments. Specifically, the court mandated that these advisements had to  include warnings that: a) the process by which the COMPAS produces risk scores were not disclosed  due to its \u2018proprietary nature\u2019; b) the accuracy of risk scores are undermined by the fact that COMPAS  relied on group data; c) the risk-assessment tool had never been tested locally for accuracy; d)  \u2018questions\u2019 have been raised about the discriminatory effect of COMPAS risk-assessments; and e)  COMPAS was developed to inform post-sentencing decisions, but not sentencing decisions  themselves. These warnings are clearly very specific to COMPAS and the context in which it is used in Wisconsin.  If similar safeguards were adopted in different contexts and with regard to different AI systems,  advisements will no doubt need to be adapted. The warnings used in Loomis have, however, been  criticised because they do not give enough information to decision-makers to enable them to  appreciate the degree to which these risk-assessments should be discounted.100 In particular, the  advisements are silent on the strength of the criticisms against COMPAS, and they say nothing about  the basis on which questions about their discriminatory effect have been raised.101 These warnings  also give no indication about likely margin of error of the assessment, so although judges are informed  that some assessments might be inaccurate, they are not in a position to appreciate how serious or  frequent these errors might be. \r\n\u2018Advisements\u2019, or warnings that encourage decision-makers to be sceptical of AI systems cannot be  considered as effective safeguards, unless they contain sufficiently helpful information for decision makers. However, even if judges are given stronger warnings than those in the Loomis advisements,  it is still doubtful whether they alone will adequately mitigate automation bias. One reason for this is  that many criminal justice decisions (such as pre-trial detention decisions) are, in practice, made very  routinely by judges. Although written advisements might initially help judges think more critically  about automated risk assessments, over time, these advisements could become repetitive and  routine, and lose much of the intended meaning and effect.102 \r\nAn effective safeguard that could work in conjunction with mandatory warnings could be for decision makers to be given a better insight into how AI systems produce a particular assessment or calculation.  As mentioned above, the lack of information about how assessments are made by AI systems makes  it harder for criminal defendants to scrutinise and challenge them. Surely, this has to be true also for  decision-makers. It is much harder, if not impossible, to analyse and criticise decisions if there is no  reasoning behind them. While AI systems do not rely on \u2018reasoning\u2019 per se, information given to  decisions about how a specific assessment was made, including what factors were relevant, and how  much weight was given to each factor could give decision-makers more confidence to decide whether  to agree or disagree with an AI-generated decision.  \r\nDecisions or assessments made by AI systems cannot be the sole basis of criminal justice decisions \u2013 they should be no more than a factor that can influence human-decision making. As such, decision makers should be required to show that decisions were influenced by a broader range of factors other  than the AI system, by way of fully reasoned, case-specific, written decisions. Research has shown that  the lack of case-specific reasoning in pre-trial detention decisions is already a serious challenge in  many EU Member States,103 and AI systems risk worsening the standardisation of such decision making processes. Where AI systems are used to inform pre-trial detention decisions, or any other  criminal justice decision that has a significant impact on the rights of the defendant, reasoned  decisions must be specific to the defendant\u2019s case, and in particular, they must reveal what which  factors influenced the decision, and to what degree. In particular, decisions have to make it clear how  much weight was given to assessments by AI systems. \r\nIt is also crucial that decision-makers are able to override decisions made by AI systems, and that they  are confident about doing so where the tool produces assessments or recommendations that are  unfavourable to the defendant (e.g. where the AI system advises against releasing the defendant). It  has been reported that members of the police force in Avon and Somerset Police in the United  Kingdom are expected to record incidences where they have disagreed with assessments made by a  predictive policing tool, and to explain their reasons for the disagreement.104 This is likely to act as a  strong disincentive for overriding decisions made by the AI system, and as such, it actively facilitates  automation bias. Furthermore, it seems to interfere with the presumption of innocence by making it  difficult for decision-makers to override AI systems to make decisions that favour the defendant. If an  AI system recommends the arrest or the detention of an individual, decision-makers should feel that  they have a genuine choice of overruling the AI system, and not be pressured into compliance.  Criminal justice decision-making processes should, as a general rule, be skewed in favour of the  defence to give effect to the presumption of innocence, and rules governing the use of AI systems  should favour favourable outcomes for defendants.  \r\nOn the other hand, in cases where a decision-maker acts against the advice of an AI system that  recommends a favourable outcome for the defendant, there should be a requirement for reasons to  be given for their decision. This is to prevent unfavourable outcomes for defendants that are  motivated by improper reasons, and to mitigate the risk of unconscious bias. \r\nChallenging AI in criminal proceedings \r\nAI systems need to be contestable by criminal defendants. This is so that they can not only challenge  the outcomes of the AI systems\u2019 calculations and analyses, but also scrutinise the legality of their use.  In other words, being able to challenge AI systems in criminal proceedings is not only a procedural  fairness requirement for defendants, it is also a means by which legal standards governing AI systems  and their use can be enforced.  \r\nOne of the major issues preventing the sufficient contestability of AI systems in criminal proceedings  is the lack of notification. If an individual is not notified that they have been subject to an automated  decision by an AI system, they will not have the ability to challenge that decision, or the information  that the decision was based on. \r\nFor example, in the United Kingdom, the Data Protection Act 2018 sets out the applicability of the  GDPR and sets out the UK\u2019s interpretations of the GDPR\u2019s requirements and safeguards. However, section 14 of the Data Protection Act significantly dilutes the requirements of Article 22 of the GDPR,  permitting purely automated decisions which have legal or similar significant effects on a data subject,  without their consent, as long as the data subject is subsequently notified that a purely automated  decision has been taken about them, after the decision has been made. It is only then that the data  subject has the opportunity to request a new decision.  \r\nHowever, it has been reported that individuals subject to decisions by the HART system in the UK are  not notified at all that they have been subject to such an automated decision, even after it has been  made.105 This is likely because under the Data Protection Act 2018, automated decisions which have  legal or similar significant effects on a subject are not necessarily classified as \u2018purely automated\u2019 if a  human has administrative input. In order to meet this requirement, the human input can be as minimal as checking a box to accept the automated-decision, even if it has a significant impact on an  individual, such as holding them in custody. This minimal requirement for human requirement means  that, in practice, decisions made with negligible to no meaningful human input can be classified as not  \u201cpurely automated\u201d and there is no legal requirement to notify and ability to request a new decision.  In this way, systems such as HART continue to be used, with people subject to their decisions  completely uninformed. \r\nWhile the GDPR already requires the notification of individuals affected by automated decisions, the  UK\u2019s experience with HART highlights the need for stricter rules to not only ensure meaningful human  input (as mentioned above), but to also strengthen the individual\u2019s right to be notified.  \r\nThere must be a requirement for individuals to be notified, not just for \u201cpurely automated\u201d decisions,  but whenever there has been an automated decision-making system involved, assistive or otherwise,  that has or may have impacted a criminal justice decision. This notification should include clear and  comprehensible information about the decision that has been taken, how that decision was reached,  including details of the information or data involved in reaching that decision, what the result or  outcomes of the decision are, and what effects, legal or otherwise they have, and information on how  to challenge that decision. \r\nAs discussed in the previous section, a further major barrier to the contestability of AI systems is a  technical one. The \u2018black box\u2019 nature of certain AI systems can be largely attributed to their design, so  it is important that there are rules governing the interpretability of these systems so that when they  are in use, their processes can be understood at all. However, there are also legal barriers to the full  disclosure of AI systems, which are often put in place to protect commercial interests. Procedural  safeguards play a particularly important and effective role in addressing these types of opacity  challenges. \r\nTransparency is a fundamental aspect of an adversarial process that underpins the right to a fair trial,  and human rights standards require that as a general rule defendants should be given unrestricted  access to their case-file,106 and to be given the opportunity to comment on the evidence used against  them.107 These standards are further reinforced by Directive 2012/13/EU,108 which requires Member  States to grant access to all material evidence in possession of the competent authorities to the  defence to safeguard the fairness of the proceedings and to enable defendants to prepare their  defence.109 The procedural requirement of an adversarial process is not one that is limited to  substantive criminal proceedings \u2013 it also applies in the context of pre-trial decision-making processes,  especially for decisions on the deprivation of liberty.110 While EU law and international human rights  law also recognise that there might be certain justifications for non-disclosure of materials used  against the defendant in criminal proceedings, these are narrow restrictions, and commercial interests  are not regarded as a valid justification for non-disclosure.111 Furthermore, EU law does not explicitly  recognise any derogations from the right of access to materials that are essential to challenging the lawfulness of an arrest or detention.112 In order for Member States to comply with these standards,  any exceptions to the disclosure of information regarding AI systems have to be applied very narrowly.  \r\nBarriers to scrutiny and accountability of AI systems are not only legal, but also technical. As explained  in previous sections, many AI systems suffer from interpretability issues because of their design and  by the nature of the machine-learning technology upon which they rely. In the absence of specific  expertise on AI, it is difficult to imagine how, in practice, defendants and their lawyers will be able to  challenge AI systems.  \r\nOne possible solution to this challenge, as explained below, is training for defence lawyers \u2013 but it is  unreasonable to expect lawyers to develop expertise that would enable them to analyse and scrutinise  AI systems at a technical level. A further solution could be that defence lawyers have access to the  relevant expertise from suitably qualified professionals. \r\nHowever, in reality, not all criminal suspects and accused persons are able to access the legal and  other technical assistance needed to understand and challenge technically complex AI systems, for  financial or other practical reasons. It would also be unreasonable and unrealistic to require all  suspects and accused persons to engage technical expertise just to be able to understand how an AI  system makes a decision, especially where AI systems are used routinely or mandatorily to make or assist criminal justice decisions. \r\nIt might seem unreasonable to expect all highly technical evidence to be challengeable by lay  defendants without the help of a suitable expert. However, AI systems are not necessarily used in  criminal proceedings as \u2018evidence\u2019, and in practice they could be an integral part of a decision-making  process, or even a replacement for it. As such, it is essential that the \u2018reasoning\u2019 of AI systems are  made known to suspects and accused persons, similarly to how judicial decisions must contain  \u201csufficient reasoning and address specific features of a given case\u201d, especially where they concern the  deprivation of liberty.113 Decision-making processes of AI systems and the way in which it has  produced an outcome in a particular case should thus be disclosed to suspects and accused persons,  in a form that is intelligible to a layperson. Individuals should not need to rely on experts to simply  understand how a decision affecting them was made. While there will inevitably be scenarios where  defendants would need expertise to challenge an AI-assisted decision, but these cases should be the  exception, rather than the norm, for whenever an AI system is used.  \r\nCriminal justice procedures should require the notification to suspects and accused persons where  an AI system has been used which has or may have impacted a decision made about that individual.  Procedures should enable the full disclosure of all aspects of AI systems that are necessary for  suspects and accused persons to contest their findings. Disclosure should be in a form which is  comprehensible to a layperson, without the need for technical or expert assistance, and suspects  and accused persons should also be given effective access to technical experts who can help to  analyse and challenge otherwise incomprehensible aspects of AI systems. \r\nTraining \r\nAI systems use technology not well understood by many people. Without proper training, outputs of  AI systems might not be easy to interpret, and it might be difficult to appreciate which factors  undermine the reliability of AI systems, so that appropriate weight can be attached to their findings.  As mentioned above, decision-makers can be warned about the weaknesses of AI systems as part of their decision-making process, but the effectiveness of this safeguard can be questioned, because it is  unlikely to provide decision-makers with all the information they need, and there is no guarantee that  the warnings will be taken seriously in all cases.  \r\nTraining is not just needed for the primary users of AI systems, such as judges and police officers who  use them to inform their own decisions. The training must also be available criminal defence lawyers,  so that they are in a better position to challenge AI systems, where necessary. If AI systems are used  routinely to aid criminal justice decisions or even made mandatory (as is the case in certain states in  the United States), there would be strong justification for governing bodies to make training on AI  mandatory for criminal justice practitioners.\r\n\r\nPart 3: Governance and Monitoring \r\nCriminal justice processes are an important enforcement mechanism for ensuring that AI systems are  designed and used lawfully, but they cannot be the sole, or even the primary means of implementing  legal and ethical standards. Of equal, if not greater importance is a framework that ensures that policy  decisions on the design and deployment of AI systems are made in systematised way, and that  unlawful or harmful AI systems never enter into public service. Member States that deploy AI systems  for criminal justice purposes should have regulatory mechanisms that are fit for purpose. At a  minimum, these should include frameworks for: a) pre-deployment impact assessments; b) post deployment monitoring and evaluations; and c) collection of data needed for effective comparative  analysis.  \r\nPre-Deployment \r\nBoth the GDPR and LED recognise the need for AI systems to be analysed before they are deployed,  so that they comply with existing regulatory and human rights standards. Under Article 35 GDPR,  Member States are required to carry out a \u2018Data Protection Impact Assessment\u2019 (\u2018DPIA\u2019) for data  processing systems that carry out \u2018a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating  to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling and on which decision  are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the  natural person\u2019. The corresponding provision in the LED is Article 27, which similarly calls for DPIAs to  be carried out where processing of data is likely to result in a \u2018high risk to the rights and freedoms of  natural persons\u2019. DPIAs under both laws have to carry out inter alia an assessment of the possible  impact of the data processing system on the rights or individuals, and they need to mention what  measures will be in place to ensure that their rights are properly protected.  \r\nDPIAs help to address a serious accountability challenge, but EU laws do not provide sufficiently  helpful standards on how they should be conducted. Article 27 LED does not lay down minimum  requirements for how DPIAs should be carried out. On the other hand, there are aspects of Article 35  GDPR which, if used to guide how DPIAs should be conducted for AI systems used in criminal justice,  would raise concerns. The foremost challenge is the level of transparency mandated by the GDPR.  DPIAs are envisaged largely as internal processes led by the data controller, who may seek the opinions  of data subjects (such as members of the public or their representatives), where it is \u2018appropriate\u2019 to  do so. The GDPR also explicitly recognises that the requirement to seek the views of data subject is  \u2018without prejudice to the protection of commercial interests\u2019.114 \r\nAs outlined above, transparency is a key aspect of a fair criminal justice system and, as a general rule,  all criminal justice decision-making processes need to be open to public scrutiny. There is no reason  why AI systems should be exempt from this requirement and, given that administration of criminal  justice is a matter of strong public interest, the public should have the right to voice their opinions and  raise objections whenever AI systems impact criminal justice processes. Also, given the highly  technical nature of AI systems, and their (as yet) poorly understood impact on society, impact  assessments must have multi-disciplinary expert engagement. 115 In particular, DPIAs should always  involve independent experts (computer scientists, in particular) who can audit, analyse, and if  possible, \u2018explain\u2019 AI systems, so that they can help legal, policy and social science experts to  determine the likely implications for the individuals\u2019 rights. \r\n\r\nFor public and expert consultations to be meaningful and effective, sufficient information should be  made available to interested parties so that the AI system can be thoroughly understood and  researched. Partnership on AI has recommended that for criminal justice risk-assessment tools,  training datasets,116 architectures and algorithms of AI systems should be made available to ensure  meaningful scrutiny.117 Commercial interests should not be regarded as a legitimate ground for  limiting the disclosure of this information.  \r\nSecondly, Article 35 GDPR allows data controllers to carry out a single DPIA \u2018for a set of similar  processing operations that present similar high risks\u2019. There is a danger that this provision could be  interpreted too broadly if Member States are given free rein to determine what two systems can be  regarded as sufficiently \u2018similar\u2019. There are risks in assuming that an AI system well-suited for use in a  particular context or within a particular geographic area will be equally useful in another. AI systems  built using data from one jurisdiction might not be able to reflect differences in, for example, law  enforcement culture and patterns of behaviour, laws and policies, and socio-demographic  characteristics of another jurisdiction.118 Sometimes, these differences can be seen in the same  country or even within the same region. For example, a study of \u2018PRECOBS\u2019 a predictive policing tool  used in Baden-Wurttemberg in Germany, found significant differences in predictive utility between  rural and urban areas.119 \r\nFinally, DPIAs seem to require data controllers to theorise the possible impact of AI systems, but there  is no strict requirement for AI systems to be subject to testing or auditing before, or immediately after  deployment. This overlooks the fact that flaws in AI systems, including unintentional biases, are not  always easily detectable, and that they might only surface once the system is put into operation. As  discussed earlier, the causes of biases in AI systems can be difficult to identify, and it is difficult to  appreciate how, short of thorough testing, the true impact of AI decisions can be known.  \r\nIn New York, the AI Now Institute has proposed an alternative model for impact assessments, known  as \u2018Algorithmic Impact Assessments\u2019 (\u2018AIAs\u2019).120 The AIA framework sets out in detail how public  authorities should conduct impact assessments of AI systems, and it can be contrasted with the  provisions of the GDPR in that AIAs place much greater emphasis on the need for community  engagement and consultations with external experts. This framework could serve as a useful guide for  Member States seeking to establish pre-deployment procedures for approving AI systems.  \r\nAI systems should not be deployed unless they have undergone an independent public impact  assessment with the involvement of appropriate experts, that is specific both to the purpose for  which the AI system is deployed, and the locality where it is deployed. AI systems must be tested  for impact pre-deployment, and systems should be precluded from deployment until they have  undergone this testing and achieved minimum standards, such as non-discrimination. \r\nPost-Deployment \r\nImpact assessments of AI systems should not be regarded as \u2018one-off\u2019 processes. They have to be  followed up with ongoing post-deployment monitoring and evaluation, so that the longer-term impact of AI systems can be understood, and shortcomings and biases that affect the rights of  individuals can be identified and fixed.  \r\nThe ability of AI systems to deliver fair and just outcomes, and to meet policy objectives can be difficult  to predict from the outset. Although AI systems can be validated and tested prior to deployment to  check if they are likely to produce desired outcomes, their impact in the real world might be different.  Furthermore, even if the likely outputs of AI systems can be predicted, it is much harder to estimate  the likely impact they will have on human decision-making.121 \r\nFurther reviews of AI systems are also necessary because criminal justice systems and the societies in  which they operate change over time. A study in the United States, for example, theorises that many  pre-trial risk assessment tools might be making predictions based on historic data that is no longer fit  for purpose. It has been suggested that because data used to train risk assessment algorithms pre \r\ndate bail reforms in many US jurisdictions, the impact of recent measures introduced to reduce the  risk of failure-to-appear, such as transportation assistance and text message alerts are not taken into  consideration \u2013 potentially leading to over-incarceration.122 Socio-demographic changes might also  require AI systems to be altered so that they continue to be fit for purpose. If, for example, an area  experiences high levels of net migration which results in rapid changes to policing patterns and judicial  behaviour, AI systems might need to be reviewed to make sure they are not unintentionally worsening  racial discrimination.  \r\nData Collection \r\nIt is difficult to imagine how the impact of AI systems can be assessed, if there is inadequate data to  support effective monitoring. The deficiency of criminal justice data across the EU has been subject to  criticism. In particular, Fair Trials has found that most EU Member States do not systemically collect  statistics on the duration of pre-trial detention, outcomes of criminal cases of pre-trial detainees, and  the likelihood of a suspect or accused person being released by the court.123 The data needed for  effective monitoring and evaluation depends on the function of the AI system and its intended  objectives, but the lack of criminal justice data more generally questions whether Member States  currently have adequate legal and policy foundations for introducing AI systems responsibly into  criminal justice processes. Data needed for monitoring and evaluation purposes will, of course, need  to have been collected from well before the introduction of the AI system, so that a proper pre- and  post- analysis comparison can be made.  \r\nOf particular concern is that in most EU Member States, race or ethnic data on criminal justice is not  available, either because there is no systemised process for collecting it, or because local laws ban this  practice altogether.124 This is a serious challenge because the most predominant criticism against the  use of AI systems in the United States and elsewhere is that it worsens racial and ethnic bias in criminal  justice decisions. Even without official statistics, there is strong evidence in many EU Member States  that certain ethnic minorities, and in particular, Roma and people of colour are unfairly  overrepresented in criminal justice systems.125 It is worrying that AI systems might worsen this  discrimination, but that there will be no way of detecting this trend, because of the lack of data.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the absence of racial and ethnic data could also prevent pre-emptive measures to  combat racial bias. It is doubtful that developers will be able to design systems free from racial bias, if  they have no data against which to measure their performance.  \r\nOn data collection, Fair Trials believe that EU and its Member States will need to make a strict choice.  Either they should ensure that racially disaggregated criminal justice data is collected, or AI systems  should be banned where they make individualised assessments for criminal justice purposes. \r\nEffective monitoring of AI systems is not possible unless there is sufficient data that makes it  possible to discern their real impact. In particular, Member States need to collect data that allow  them to identify discriminatory impacts of AI systems, including discrimination on the basis of race  and ethnicity.\r\n", "full_prompt": " Answer the following question using only details found in the attached paper. You should NOT reference outside sources or your own knowledge. \n\nWhat are some examples of visible and hidden biases that have been observed in criminal justice AI? \n\nExecutive Summary \r\n\u2018Artificial Intelligence\u2019 (\u2018AI\u2019), comprising machine-learning and other analytical algorithm-based  automated systems, has become an important aspect of our lives. In recent years, this technology has  been increasingly deployed in criminal justice systems across the world, playing an increasingly  significant role in the administration of justice in criminal cases. This trend is often driven by  perceptions about the reliability and impartiality of technological solutions, and pressures to make  cost savings in policing and court services. \r\nHowever, studies in various jurisdictions, including in Europe, provide substantial evidence that AI and  machine-learning systems can have a significantly negative influence on criminal justice.  \r\nAI systems have been shown to directly generate and reinforce discriminatory and unjust outcomes;  infringing fundamental rights, they have been found to have little to no positive influence on the  quality of human decisions, and they have been criticised for poor design that does not comply with  human rights standards.  \r\nMost AI systems used in criminal justice systems are statistical models, based on data which is representative of structural biases and inequalities in the societies which the data represents, and  which is always comprehensively lacking in the kind of detail that is needed to make truly \u2018accurate\u2019  predictions or decisions. The data used to build and populate these systems is mostly or entirely from  within criminal justice systems, such as law enforcement or crime records. This data does not  represent an accurate record of criminality, but merely a record of law enforcement - the crimes,  locations and groups that are policed within that society, rather than the actual occurrence of crime.  The data reflects social inequalities and discriminatory policing patterns, and its use in these AI  systems merely results in a reinforcement and re-entrenchment of those inequalities and  discrimination in criminal justice outcomes.  \r\nGiven these extremely serious risks, strong regulatory frameworks are needed to govern the use of AI  in criminal justice decision-making and, in some circumstances, to restrict its use entirely.  \r\nExisting EU data protection laws restrict the use of automated decisions, but there are gaps and  ambiguities that could result in the use of AI systems in ways that undermine human rights, if not  accompanied by further guidance or legislation.  \r\nFirstly, EU laws currently only prohibit decisions that are solely based on automated processes, but  they do not regulate decision-making processes that are largely dependent on automated systems.  Given that most AI systems in use today are designed and deployed to assist, rather than replace, human decision-making in criminal justice systems, they largely fall outside the remit of EU data  protection laws on automated decisions. Secondly, the prohibition on automated decisions is subject  to broad exceptions. Individuals can be subject to decisions based solely on automated processes if  authorised by EU or Member State law, and there are deemed to be appropriate human rights  safeguards in place, including the right to obtain human intervention. However, there is not enough  clarity on what safeguards are needed, and how \u2018human intervention\u2019 should be interpreted.  \r\nIn order to regulate the use of AI in criminal justice proceedings, the EU must, at a minimum, set  standards to address the following questions: \r\n1) what standards are needed to govern the design and deployment of AI systems in criminal  justice systems;  \r\n2) what safeguards are needed in criminal justice proceedings to make sure that AI systems are  used in accordance with human rights standards and prevent discrimination; and \r\n \r\n3) how Member States should govern the deployment of AI systems and monitor their  subsequent use.  \r\nThe design of AI systems and their deployment in criminal justice proceedings should be regulated to generate human rights compliant, non-discriminatory outcomes. Minimum standards and safeguards  should be set, which, if they cannot be adhered to, should preclude the use of the AI system in  question. AI should also be regulated so that they are sufficiently transparent and explainable to  enable effective independent scrutiny. AI systems should be designed and deployed to comply with  and give effect to inter alia the right of access to court, the right to be presumed innocent, and the  right to liberty. AI systems should not undermine the right to be tried by an impartial and independent  tribunal and, in line with existing EU laws, no individual should be subject to an automated decision  that results in a criminal record. AI systems should be designed so that they do not pre-designate an  individual as a criminal before trial, nor should they allow the police to take unjustified,  disproportionate measures against individuals without reasonable suspicion. AI systems that inform  criminal justice outcomes should, as a general rule, favour outcomes that are favourable to the  defendant. Where AI systems inform decisions on the deprivations of liberty, they should be calibrated  to generate outcomes that favour release, and they should not facilitate detention other than as a  measure of last resort. AI systems must be subject to rigorous testing to ensure that they have the  desired effect of reducing pre-trial detention rates. \r\nAI systems must be developed to guarantee that they do not generate discriminatory outcomes,  ensuring that suspects and accused persons are not disadvantaged, either directly or indirectly, on  account of their protected characteristics, including race, ethnicity, nationality or socioeconomic  background. AI systems should be subject to mandatory testing before and after deployment so that  any discriminatory impact can be identified and addressed. AI systems which cannot adhere to this  minimum standard should have no place in the criminal justice system. \r\nAI systems need to be transparent and explainable, so they can be understood and scrutinised by their  primary users, suspects and accused persons, and the general public. Commercial or proprietary  interests should never be a barrier to transparency. AI systems must be designed in a way that allows  criminal defendants to understand and contest the decisions made against them. It should be possible  to carry out an independent audit of each AI system, and its processes should be reproducible for that  purpose. \r\nMember States should have laws that govern how AI systems are relied upon in criminal proceedings,  and there must be adequate safeguards to prevent over-reliance on AI by decision-makers, to prevent  discrimination and to ensure scrutiny and effective challenge by the defence.  \r\nProcedural safeguards should actively tackle automation-bias amongst criminal justice decision makers. Examples include:  \r\na) making it a legal requirement for decision-makers to be adequately alerted and informed  about the risks associated with AI systems; \r\nb) making AI systems\u2019 assessments intelligible to decision-makers; \r\nc) requiring decision-makers to provide full, individualised reasoning for all decisions influenced  by an AI system; and \r\nd) making it easy for decision-makers to overrule AI assessments that produce unfavourable  outcomes for defendants.  \r\nCriminal justice procedures should ensure that defendants are notified if an AI system has been used  which has or may have influenced a decision taken about them at any point in the criminal justice \r\n\r\nsystem, from investigation to arrest, from charge to conviction, and sentence. Procedures should  enable the full disclosure of all aspects of AI systems that are necessary for suspects and accused  persons to contest their findings. Disclosure should be in a form which is clear and comprehensible to  a layperson, without the need for technical or expert assistance, in order to ensure fairness, equality  of arms, and to discharge the obligations to provide all relevant information and be given reasons for  decisions under the right to a fair trial. Suspects and accused persons should also be given effective  access to technical experts who can help to analyse and challenge otherwise incomprehensible  aspects of AI systems. Training should be made available to all primary users of AI systems, and to  criminal defence practitioners, so that there is greater awareness of AI technology, and of the risks of  over-reliance on AI.  \r\nEffective regulation of AI systems should be facilitated by a governance and monitoring framework.  AI systems should not be deployed unless they have undergone an independent public impact  assessment with the involvement of appropriate experts, that is specific both to the purpose for which  the AI system is deployed, and the locality where it is deployed. A requirement of the assessment  should be a consideration of whether it is necessary to use AI in the particular use case, or whether  an alternative solution could achieve the same aims.  \r\nAs far as it is possible to do so, AI systems should also be tested for impact pre-deployment, a part of  which should be the minimum requirement to prove that the AI system has no discriminatory impact,  either directly or indirectly, before it can be deployed. AI systems should be kept under regular review  post-deployment. Effective monitoring of AI systems is not possible unless there is sufficient data that  makes it possible to discern their real impact. In particular, Member States need to collect data that  allow them to identify discriminatory impacts of AI systems, including discrimination on the basis of  race and ethnicity. \r\n\r\nBackground \r\nRapid technological advancements in recent years have made artificial intelligence (\u2018AI\u2019) an  increasingly prominent aspect of our lives.  \r\nThere are differences of opinion as to the definition of AI and its true meaning, but for the purposes  of this paper we are broadly referring to automated decision-making systems based on algorithms,  including machine-learning, which are used in the criminal justice system. \r\nThere is little doubt that AI has great capacity to increase human potential and improve the lives of  many, but the increasing role of AI in assisting important public functions has also highlighted serious  risks and challenges. If not subject to proper regulation and oversight, AI can threaten fundamental  human rights and, far from expanding human potential, it can amplify and worsen harmful aspects of  our society, including inequality and injustice.  \r\nThis challenge is particularly evident where AI has been used to assist the administration of justice in  criminal cases. In recent years, more and more jurisdictions across the world have begun to use AI  technology to inform and assist policing and judicial decisions, often driven by perceptions about the  reliability and impartiality of technological solutions, and pressures to make cost-savings in policing  and court services. In some countries, algorithmic processes can influence which geographic  neighbourhoods should be subject to increased law enforcement and when, as well as which  individuals should be specifically targeted by law enforcement. They can help to determine whether  someone should be arrested, whether they should be charged with a criminal offence, whether they  should be detained in prison before trial and, if convicted and sentenced, the length of their sentence.  AI is being used more and more to influence highly sensitive, high impact decisions that have far reaching, long-term implications for individuals\u2019 rights.  \r\nResearch emerging from the United States, where the use of AI in criminal justice is particularly  widespread, and from the United Kingdom and some EU Member States, however, seriously questions  whether AI has a positive influence on criminal justice systems. AI tools and systems have been found  to actively generate discriminatory criminal justice outcomes, they have been found to have little to  no positive influence on the quality of human decisions, and they have been criticised for poor design,  that does not reflect or give effect to human rights standards. These criticisms might not be justified  for all AI systems, but these studies highlight the need for much stronger regulatory frameworks to  govern the use of AI.  \r\nWe believe that unless it is subject to robust regulation, it is unlikely that AI can be used in criminal  justice systems without undermining the right to a fair trial. In some cases, it should be restricted from  use entirely. \r\nEU Member States should be encouraged to take a much more cautious approach to AI and subject  automated processes to more stringent rules that are designed to ensure human rights compliance. \r\nThere is the potential for AI systems, if properly and robustly regulated, to have a positive impact on  criminal justice system, advancing human rights, for example, by analysing law enforcement or judicial  decisions to identify patterns of erroneous or poor decision-making, or discrimination.  \r\nThe EU is already a world leader on AI regulation, having adopted ground-breaking data protection  laws in recent years to shield individuals from automated decisions that have an adverse effect on  their rights. We welcome the EU\u2019s commitment to build further on existing legal standards, and we  emphasise that addressing the impact of AI on criminal justice has to be a primary consideration for  EU policy makers when deciding on appropriate legal standards. Discussions around the impact of AI\r\n\r\non human rights have largely been centred on data protection, the right to privacy, and broader  questions of ethics and human dignity. However, despite the increasing use of AI systems in criminal  justice systems across the world, only limited discussions have so far focused on how these systems  impact the right to a fair trial, and what regulations are needed to address that impact.  \r\nAbout this paper \r\nFair Trials has produced this policy paper to highlight the need for EU-wide standards on the regulation  of AI in criminal justice, and to inform EU policy makers about the standards and safeguards needed  to ensure effective protection of fair trial rights where criminal justice decisions are assisted by AI.  \r\nThe EU Commission recognised that AI represents risks for fundamental rights, including the right to  a fair trial, in its 2020 White Paper, \u2018On Artificial Intelligence \u2013 A European approach to excellence and  trust\u2019. It also recognised the need for improvements to the EU\u2019s legislative framework on AI, noting in  particular the challenges in the \u2018effective application and enforcement of existing EU and national  legislation\u2019 and the \u2018limitations of scope of existing EU legislation\u2019.  \r\nIn this paper, we identify the most common fair trial rights issues raised by existing AI systems, based  on examples and experiences from the EU, the United Kingdom, and the United States. We also offer  examples of practical legal and policy solutions that could help to address these challenges, and to  assist in the effective implementation of the EU\u2019s fundamental rights standards in this area. We  recognise that the use of AI has a broader impact on human rights beyond the right to a fair trial, and  that there are important social and ethical issues that also need to be addressed. However, we have  narrowed the focus of this paper given Fair Trials\u2019 mission and field of expertise. \r\nThis paper should not be treated as an exhaustive list of fair trial rights standards that need to be  introduced. AI is used in many ways in criminal justice systems cross the world and, as the technology  continues to develop, it is likely that we will eventually see the deployment of AI technology in ways  never imagined before. This paper focuses primarily on AI systems that carry out individualised risk  assessments, given that these types of systems have had the most significant impact on individuals\u2019  rights so far, and we envisage that similar systems will become increasingly common in the near  future. \r\n\r\nExisting EU Legal Framework \r\nExisting EU laws restrict the use of automated decisions in a wide variety of contexts. Article 22 of the  General Data Protection Regulation (\u2018GDPR\u2019) provides that data subjects have the right not to be  subject to decisions \u2018solely\u2019 based on automated processes, where they produce \u2018legal effects\u2019  concerning them, or where they \u2018similarly significantly affect\u2019 them. The Law Enforcement Directive  (\u2018LED\u2019) \u2013 the EU data legislation that governs the processing of data for criminal justice purposes \u2013 has  a very similar provision at Article 11, which requires Member States to prohibit decisions based solely  on automated processing, where they produce \u2018adverse legal effects\u2019 on the individual, or effects that  are \u2018similarly significant\u2019.  \r\nHowever, there are two notable gaps in the existing legislative framework governing automated  decision-making systems under both the GDPR and the LED. These ambiguities and potential  loopholes could be exploited in ways that seriously undermine the general prohibition of automated  decision-making processes, and adversely impact human rights. It is necessary, therefore, that the EU  provides further guidance on how these provisions should be interpreted, including thorough  legislation (if appropriate) to further clarify the circumstances in which Member States are allowed to  deploy AI systems for criminal justice proceedings.  \r\nFirstly, the provisions in the GDPR and LED only prohibit decisions based \u2018solely\u2019 on automated  processes. In other words, the laws regulate the impact of decisions made through automated  processing, but not the AI systems themselves. As discussed later in this paper, the main human rights  challenges of AI systems can be attributed to how they are designed and trained, and the types of  technology used, such as machine-learning, so it is crucial that decisions about the design and  deployment of AI systems are also regulated.  \r\nSecondly, neither the GDPR or LED provide regulatory standards to govern situations where  automated processing is not the \u2018sole\u2019 basis of a decision, but a primary influencer. In reality, the  difference between a fully automated decision and a decision made with a \u2018human-in-the-loop\u2019 is not  always clear, but because of this strict classification, AI systems are able to be used and have significant  legal effects without the corresponding safeguards. Stronger legal standards are needed to make sure  that semi-automated decision-making processes do not become de facto automated processes. \r\nThirdly, the prohibition on automated decision-making is subject to two very broad exceptions.  Automated decisions are prohibited under the GDPR and LED, \u2018unless authorised by Union or Member  State law\u2019 and there need to be \u2018appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data  subject, at least the right to obtain human intervention\u2019.1 These provisions give extremely wide  discretion to Member States to override the general prohibition. It is significant that EU laws  emphasise the need for human rights safeguards, and the need to ensure the possibility of human  interventions, but neither of these concepts have yet been adequately defined. Although influential  actors like the EU and the Council of Europe have established principles on the ethical and responsible  use of AI, there is currently no authoritative guidance on the practical safeguards that need to be in  place.2Likewise, the meaning of \u2018human intervention\u2019 is open to interpretation. LED provides some  guidance on who should be carrying out the human intervention,3 but there needs to be greater clarity  on what meaningful human intervention entails in different contexts. \r\nIn order to regulate the use of AI in criminal justice proceedings, and close the gaps in existing data  protection laws, the EU must, at a minimum, set standards to address the following questions: \r\n1) what standards are needed to govern the design and deployment of AI systems in criminal  justice systems;  \r\n2) what safeguards are needed in criminal justice proceedings to make sure that AI systems are  used in accordance with human rights standards and prevent discrimination; and  3) how Member States should govern the deployment of AI systems and monitor their  subsequent use.\r\n\r\nPart 1: Regulating the Design and Deployment of AI Systems in Criminal Justice Systems \r\nAI systems deployed to assist criminal justice decision-making have to be fit-for-purpose. The purposes  of AI systems differ depending on the context in which they are deployed, but there are a few common  considerations that need to be taken into account to determine whether it is appropriate for the AI  system to be used.  \r\nFirstly, AI systems have to be designed to produce outcomes that are desirable from a human rights  and non-discrimination perspective. This means that rather than being exclusively focused on  delivering \u2018accurate\u2019 outcomes in criminal cases, AI systems have to be designed to facilitate fair,  impartial and non-discriminatory criminal processes. Developers of AI systems and public entities that  commission them should, in particular, make sure that AI systems are consciously designed to give  effect to, and promote the right to fair trial. The fundamental issues with the way AI systems are  designed and built, resulting in discriminatory outcomes, must also be considered. Given the  significant evidence of AI systems influencing discriminatory outcomes, special efforts must be made  to ensure that AI systems do not produce discriminatory outcomes.  \r\nSecondly, AI systems need to be designed in a way that makes it possible for criminal defendants and  the broader public to scrutinise them. This means that AI systems should not only be made open to  scrutiny (rather than concealed to protect commercial interests), but their inner workings and  processes should also be discernible and comprehensible.  \r\nAI Systems should be designed to protect and promote the right to a fair trial \r\nWhere AI systems are used to assist or inform criminal justice decisions, they support an important  act of public administration that has a significant impact on the rights of suspects and accused persons.  AI systems do more than just provide outputs that decision-makers can take into consideration as  evidence. By attempting to mimic human analytical processes and reasoning, they can provide  influential advisory input into human decision-making, or even replace it altogether. As such, it is right  that human rights standards that govern criminal justice decision-making also apply to AI systems. \r\nThe Council of Europe and the EU Commission\u2019s High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (\u2018AI  HLEG\u2019) have both recognised that fundamental rights should be a key guiding principle for the design  and deployment of AI systems.4 The Council of Europe recommends that AI systems are built according  to \u2018human rights by design\u2019 principles, and recognises that AI systems should not undermine the right  to a fair trial under the European Convention on Human Rights (\u2018ECHR\u2019). The AI HLEG has similarly  recognised that the respect for fundamental rights, as enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental  Rights and international human rights instruments, should form the foundations of trustworthy AI. AI  HLEG\u2019s Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI (\u2018the Ethics Guidelines\u2019) also recognise the need for AI  systems to comply with other types of EU legislation. Although not mentioned explicitly in the Ethics  Guidelines, Fair Trials would emphasise that the design of AI systems and the ways in which they are  deployed in the EU should, in particular, be compatible with the standards set out in the procedural rights directives under the \u2018Roadmap for strengthening procedural rights of suspected or accused  persons in criminal proceedings\u2019.5 \r\nWe would also like to note the potential for AI systems to have a positive impact on criminal justice  systems. Public debate about the relationship between AI and human rights have predominantly been  centred on the idea that AI is a threat to human rights. It is equally important, as technology takes an  increasingly prominent role in public life, to consider what positive potential they may have. Policy \r\nmakers, developers, civil society activists, and other stakeholders should try to identify ways in which  AI can also play an active role in advancing human rights, and improve the fairness of criminal justice  systems. For example, AI systems could be used to analyse law enforcement or judicial decisions to  identify patterns of erroneous or poor decision-making, or discrimination, for preventative purposes.  \r\nAI systems which are used as part of criminal justice decision-making should be designed not just to  ensure that they do not undermine the right to a fair trial, but also to promote it. However, as  explained below, given the embedded biases in the criminal data used to develop and train AI systems,  there are serious doubts, based on recent studies, whether AI systems can promote fair criminal  justice at all.  \r\nThere are various aspects of the right to a fair trial and, without speculating on what kind of AI systems  will be developed in the future to support criminal justice decision-making, it is difficult to articulate  how fair trial rights standards should inform the design of AI systems. However, examples of AI  systems currently deployed in the EU and elsewhere suggest that there are certain aspects of the right  to a fair trial that require special attention. These are: \r\na) the right of access to court \r\nb) the presumption of innocence; \r\nc) the principle of the equality of arms; and  \r\nd) the right to liberty.  \r\nAccess to Court \r\nThe notion of AI systems replacing courts to determine the guilt or innocence of the accused may  seem far-fetched at present, but there is a growing trend of automated administration of justice across  the world that might threaten the right of access to court. For example, in several European countries,  speeding and other minor traffic offences have been detected and enforced by means of automated  processes for more than a decade.6 Although nominally criminal processes, these types of proceedings  are, in reality, normally administrative in nature, and they rarely have a \u2018significant\u2019 impact on the  rights of individuals. However, as surveillance technology develops, thanks to AI, there is a real  likelihood that the scope of crimes punishable by way of automation will increase.7 \r\nIn the United Kingdom, the government announced plans in 2017 that would enable defendants to  enter guilty pleas via an online portal after viewing the charges and evidence against them, for a small number of minor offences.8 Under this procedure, known as \u2018automatic online conviction\u2019, defendants  would be automatically convicted and fined without any judicial oversight if they accept the charges  against them. Although it is debatable whether this system can truly be characterised as an AI system,  it is an example of the automated administration of criminal justice, that replaces a function usually  played by courts.  \r\nIt is worrying that the UK government has proposed expanding this scheme to other \u2018non imprisonable\u2019 offences, if itis regarded as a success.9Fair Trials has outlined concerns about expanding  the scope of cases where accused persons can be convicted without judicial oversight, even if such  procedures are reserved solely for minor, non-imprisonable offences.10 The impacts of a criminal  conviction, even for a minor offence, can be numerous, long-term, and hard to predict, affecting inter  alia job prospects, educational opportunities, and immigration status. It is crucial that what amounts  to \u2018legal effects\u2019 and \u2018similar significant effects\u2019 concerning the data subject for the purposes of  automated decision-making are interpreted very broadly.11 In particular, given that a criminal record  always has a \u2018legal\u2019 or \u2018significant\u2019 effect, any automated decision-making process that directly results  in a criminal record should be prohibited.  \r\nAI systems should not undermine the right to be tried by an impartial and independent tribunal,  and in line with existing EU laws, no individual should be subject to an automated decision that  resultsin their being held in custody or detention, gives them a criminal record, or which determines  a criminal sentence or sanction. No individual should be subject to an automated decision which  engages their human rights without meaningful human input. \r\nPresumption of Innocence \r\nThe right to be presumed innocent in criminal proceedings is a basic human right, and one that is  expressly recognised in, and safeguarded by EU law under Directive 2016/343 (the \u2018Presumption of  Innocence Directive\u2019).12 The increasing use of AI in the sphere of criminal justice, however, raises  questions about the scope of this right, and how AI systems should be built and used to protect it.  Concerns about how AI systems undermine the presumption of innocence have been voiced in the  context of certain types of predictive policing software.13 \r\nA variety of predictive policing tools that aim to facilitate preventative policing measures and to deter  crimes before they have taken place have been developed and deployed across Europe.14 Tools which  predict the time and place where certain crimes are likely to take place have been used in many European countries. Similar tools have also been developed to identify potential suspects, which are  used widely in the US, and now increasingly in Europe.15 \r\nAn example is the \u2018Strategic Subject List\u2019 in Chicago, a police database of around 400,000 local  residents who were assigned threat scores that determine the likelihood that they will commit  crimes.16 The algorithms used to generate these scores were not open to the public, so the exact  process by which individual risk levels were assessed were not known. Despite this lack of  transparency, it is clear that threat scores generated by the software had significant impacts on  individuals\u2019 rights \u2013 in particular, their right to privacy. Individuals with higher threat scores were, for  example, more likely to be subject to targeted police surveillance, or home visits \u2013 as though they  were officially recognised as predisposed to commit crimes, irrespective of any credible suspicion of  wrongdoing.17 The Strategic Subject List was decommissioned in January 2020 by the Chicago police  who cited ineffectiveness as the primary reason for the decision.18 \r\nThese types of predictive policing tools are now being used in Europe. In the United Kingdom, a  coalition of police forces have been developing a system not dissimilar to the Strategic Subject List,  that aims to identify individuals who are likely to commit crimes.19 Known as the National Data  Analytics Solution (\u2018NDAS\u2019), this risk assessment tool uses statistical analysis and machine-learning to  inform policing decisions, and to facilitate \u2018early interventions\u2019 where appropriate.20 The sources of  data that the system uses to conduct its risk assessments raise concerns that the system will be built  to profile individuals on the basis of very sensitive, personal information, including stop and search  data, data from social services, and the National Health Service.21 Where this data is used to indicate  the likelihood of individuals\u2019 criminality, it will inevitably flag up people whose profiles fit those who are over-represented in that data as being higher risk. It is particularly worrying that an individual  might be profiled for policing purposes on the basis of their health conditions or their access to  essential services, such as welfare or benefits. These factors should not be regarded as relevant factors  for determining whether someone may commit criminal offences. \r\nAlso in the UK, the Metropolitan Police in London operates a database called the Gangs Matrix, which  contains information and risk-assessments on individuals who are alleged \u2018gang\u2019 members.22 This  database was created using criminal justice data, including police and crime records. The Gangs Matrix  and the assessments it produces assists policing decisions, including the deployment of stop and  search, and further enforcement action, such as imprisonment and deportation. A further tactic  resulting from the risk assessments made by the Gangs Matrix is the threat of eviction or exclusion from education, as names and details of these alleged gang members have been shared with education, healthcare and housing providers.23 \r\nIn the Netherlands, the government has been running an algorithmic risk assessment tool, ProKid 12- SI, which purports to assess the risk of criminality of 12-year-old children since 2009.24 ProKid uses  existing police data on these children, such as reports of where children have come into contact with  the police, their addresses, information about their \u2018living environment\u2019, even including whether they  are victims of violence, to identify them as being in one of four categories of \u2018risk\u2019 of committing crimes in future.25 The system assesses children based on their relationships with other people and their  supposed risk levels, meaning that individuals can be deemed higher risk by being linked to another  individual with a high risk assessment, such as a sibling or a friend.26 Parents\u2019 assessed risk can also  impact a child\u2019s risk level. ProKid\u2019s algorithms assess risks in relation to future actions that the children  have not yet carried out, and judges them on the basis of the actions of others close to them.27 These  risk assessments result in police \u2018registering\u2019 these children on their systems and monitoring them,  and then referring them to youth \u2018care\u2019 services.28 ProKid frames children as potential perpetrators  even when they are registered as victims of violence; which has serious implications on their presumption of innocence.29 \r\nSeveral similar tools are also used in the Netherlands, including the Reference Index for High Risk  Youth, a large-scale risk assessment system that focuses on assessing under-23-year-olds.30 \r\nPredictive policing tools like NDAS, ProKid and the Gangs Matrix can be regarded as part of a broader  trend in law enforcement that moves away from \u2018reactive\u2019 policing, and towards \u2018preventative\u2019 or  \u2018proactive\u2019 policing.31 NDAS and other similar predictive policing tools intend to pursue legitimate  objectives of preventing, or reducing harm,32 but there are serious concerns that these systems single out individuals as \u2018pre-criminals\u2019, who are subject to police interventions even though they are not  formally suspected of any crime, and there is no evidence that they have done anything wrong.33 It is  of further concern that these types of predictive policing tools do not necessarily designate individuals\u2019  risk levels on the basis of their past actions, or behaviour that can be regarded as \u2018suspicious\u2019 in any way, but on account of factors far beyond their control, and immutable characteristics. In particular,  there is strong evidence to suggest that AI systems have a tendency to overestimate the risks of  criminality of certain ethnic and racial groups. For example, out of 3,800 people on the Gangs Matrix,  80% are 12-24 years old, and 78% of them are black \u2013 a clearly disproportionate and discriminatory proportion. The discriminatory impact of AI in criminal justice systems is discussed in further detail in  the following section. \r\nAlthough predictive policing tools do not directly \u2018convict\u2019 people, they not only allow the police to  treat legally innocent individuals as pseudo-criminals, but they can also result individuals being  deprived of their basic rights with regard to education, housing, and other public services \u2013 effectively  \u2018punishing\u2019 them on account of their profiles. This seriously damages the fundamental human rights  principle that the matter of guilt or innocence can only be determined by means of a fair and lawful  criminal justice process.34 \r\nWhile it is clear that certain types of predictive policing can infringe the presumption of innocence  from a moral and ethical viewpoint, it is debatable whether these systems also violate the legal  presumption of innocence under EU law and international human rights law. The Presumption of  Innocence Directive applies to natural persons who are \u2018suspects\u2019 and \u2018accused persons\u2019, from the  moment they are suspected or accused of a crime.35 However, there is some ambiguity about the  exact stage at which an individual attains the status of a \u2018suspect\u2019 under the Presumption of Innocence  Directive,36 and about whether the scope of the Presumption of Innocence Directive extends to  decisions to designate an individual as a suspect (or a \u2018pre-criminal\u2019). On the other hand, the ECHR appears to have taken a clearer position that measures undertaken pre-charge, as a general rule, fall  outside the scope of the presumption of innocence.37 It has also held that preventative measures, such  as surveillance, do not amount to criminal sanctions for the purposes of Article 6 ECHR.38 \r\nEven if the current language on the presumption of innocence is such that it is not directly applicable  to the predictive policing context, it must be recognised that these tools nevertheless interfere with  human rights. In particular, the targeted surveillance that results from predictive policing has clear  implications on the right to privacy. The acceptable degree to which criminal justice processes can  interfere with this right is a matter that might require clearer articulation, as is the question of the  impact of Article 8 ECHR violations on criminal proceedings.  \r\nAI systems that inform charging decisions have also been developed and deployed. An example of this  is the Harm Assessment Risk Tool (\u2018HART\u2019) currently being used by Durham Constabulary in the United  Kingdom. HART uses a machine-learning algorithm to assess a suspect\u2019s risk of reoffending, using over  thirty variables that characterise an individual\u2019s criminal history and socio-demographic background.  The risk assessments conducted by HART are used by the local police to determine whether an  individual should be charged, or diverted into a rehabilitation programme. HART does not determine  whether an individual is guilty or innocent, but its assessment can trigger a chain of events that can  result in the deprivation of liberty, and/or a criminal conviction. Charging decisions should surely be  based on the merits of individual cases, and it is difficult to imagine how decisions on entry into  diversion programmes can be made by means other than a careful consideration of individual circumstances. These types of high impact, fact-sensitive decisions should never be delegated to  automated processes, particularly those which operate by identifying correlations rather than causal  links between an individual\u2019s characteristics and their likely behaviour.  \r\nAn examination of HART also reveals flaws in how the tool is designed. HART is calibrated to err on  the side of caution,39 because it regards under-estimations of risk levels as a more serious error than  over-estimations, so that under-estimations occur less frequently. In other words, HART is deliberately  designed to underestimate who is eligible for entry into the diversion programme, so it is predisposed  to over-criminalise. This approach conflicts with the notion that any doubt in a criminal case should  be interpreted in favour of the defendant (\u2018in dubio reo\u2019).40 A human rights compliant approach to  criminal justice decision-making would do the opposite of what HART does \u2013 it would need to err on  the side of the defendant.  \r\nAI systems should respect the presumption of innocence and they must be designed so that they do  not pre-designate an individual as a criminal before trial, nor should they allow or assist the police  to take unjustified, disproportionate measures against individuals without reasonable suspicion. AI  systems that inform criminal justice outcomes should, as a general rule, favour outcomes that are  favourable to the defendant. \r\nEquality of Arms \r\nA major concern raised in the studies of certain AI systems is that they are inaccessible for adequate  scrutiny by defendants and their lawyers. This has serious implications for the principle of equality of  arms and the right to an adversarial process, because without information about how a decision is  made, it is difficult to envisage how defendants can question the accuracy and legality of the decision.  The need for AI systems used in criminal justice to be transparent, explainable and understandable to  all is addressed in more detail below. \r\nThe Right to Liberty \r\nIn the United States, \u2018risk-assessment\u2019 tools that use AI technology have been used to assist pre-trial  assessments that determine whether a defendant should be released on bail, or held on remand pending their trial. Examples of risk-assessment tools currently being used in the United States include  COMPAS, the Public Safety Assessment (\u2018PSA\u2019), and the Federal Pre-Trial Risk Assessment Instrument  (\u2018PTRA\u2019). Many of these tools are also used to inform decisions on parole and sentencing.  \r\nThese tools have, however, been subject to intense criticism for several reasons. Studies have shown  inter alia that risk assessments make inaccurate predictions that are no better than those made by  non-expert humans. They do not result in a significant reduction in pre-trial detention rates, and that  they produce disparate outcomes for different racial groups. The US-based NGO Partnership on AI has  found that AI risk assessment tools currently being used in the United States are unfit for use in pre trial assessments, and it has recommended that policymakers cease the deployment of risk  assessment tools until such time that the challenges affecting such tools have been adequately  addressed.41 \r\nThe adoption of pre-trial risk-assessments tools in the United States has largely been driven by the  desire to address high imprisonment rates in the country by making pre-trial decision-making fairer.  \r\nIn particular, these tools have been promoted as an alternative to cash bail \u2013 a system often criticised  for disadvantaging poorer defendants and worsening social injustices.42 Cash bail is a relatively rare  concept in the EU, but there are concerns about the quality of pre-trial detention decisions in many  Member States, which have been criticised for failing to carry out case-specific reviews and fully  consider alternatives to detention.43  \r\nWe are currently unaware of any attempts in EU Member States to introduce algorithmic risk  assessments to supplement or replace existing pre-trial decision-making processes. However, it is  possible that risk-assessment tools will also be recommended as a solution to address the pre-trial  detention challenge in Europe, especially given that many of these tools are developed by private  companies that actively market their products to governments and local police forces.  \r\nRisk-assessment tools are usually designed to assess the likelihood of re-arrest, and/or of failure to  turn up to court after being released based on the profiles of the defendant. Based on these  assessments, risk assessment tools either assign risk levels to defendants, or they provide direct advice  to decision-makers on whether or not the defendant should be released. There is only limited research  about the extent to which pre-trial risk-assessment tools influence judges\u2019 decisions in practice,44 but  concerns have been raised about the ability of AI systems to recommend detention at all.45 There is a  risk that recommendations made by AI systems to detain individuals compromise the presumption of  release. This is a particularly valid concern in light of research suggesting that decision-makers have a  tendency to err on the side of caution when they are \u2018advised\u2019 by AI systems, and that they have a  greater propensity to override risk assessment tools to detain, rather than release defendants.46 Pre trial detention should always be a measure of last resort, and no risk-assessment can be regarded as  human rights compliant, unless it recommends its users to consider detention as a measure of last  resort, after all other alternatives have been fully considered. \r\nPre-trial risk assessment tools in the United States and elsewhere have also been criticised for  (unintentionally) over-estimating risks, because of the nature of the data used to train its algorithms.  \r\nPre-trialrisk assessment tools typically rely only on data regarding individuals who have been released,  and they ignore those who were detained, but would have otherwise \u2018succeeded\u2019 by not being  arrested, and by appearing in court.47 In other words, algorithms are based on the assumption that  individuals who have been detained by courts in the past have been rightfully deprived of their liberty.  Any AI system developed to assist pre-trial detention decision-making must be designed to give effect  to the presumption in favour of release. This means that risk-assessment tools need to be deliberately  calibrated to generate outcomes that favourable to the defendant. Data used to train the AI system  should be carefully scrutinised so that it reflects the inevitable fact that a significant proportion of  individuals in pre-trial detention have been deprived of their liberty in violation of their human rights.\r\nStudies of pre-trial risk-assessment tools used in the United States cast doubt on their effectiveness  at reducing pre-trial detention rates, and their ability to make accurate predictions of risks. A study in  Kentucky, for example, found that the likelihood of defendants being released within the first three  days of their arrest went down after the risk-assessment tool was deployed, and that there were no  significant changes in the number of re-arrests and failure-to-appear rates amongst defendants  released on bail during the same period.48 This was the case even after the risk-assessment tool was  modified post-deployment to improve the accuracy of predictions. Another study has found that the  COMPAS risk-assessment tool is no better at predicting the likelihood of defendants reoffending than  non-expert human volunteers.49 These studies do not necessarily prove that AI systems are incapable  of reducing pre-trial detention rates at all, but they do raise questions about their usefulness, and they  strongly challenge claims that algorithmic risk-assessment tools help to improve the quality of pre trial detention decisions. They also highlight the need for post-deployment testing and monitoring of  AI systems, to ensure that they have the desired effect of ensuring that individuals are detained only  as a measure of last resort. \r\nPost-trial assessment systems are also being increasingly used, for purposes such as assisting with sentencing decisions or prisoner release. \r\nIn England and Wales, the Prison and Probation Service has developed and operates the Offender  Assessment System (OASys), an automated risk-assessment tool.50 It assesses the risk of harm  offenders pose to others and how likely an offender is to reoffend, as well as assessing offender needs.  These risk assessments are used to decide \u2018interventions\u2019 and to influence the sentence plans given  to offenders.51 Millions of these assessments have been carried out.52 The system collates information  on offenders\u2019 previous offences, education, training, employment, alcohol and drug misuse; as well as  their \u2018attitudes\u2019, \u2018thinking and behaviour\u2019, \u2018relationships\u2019, and \u2018lifestyle\u2019.53 This data is used alongside  the individual\u2019s offending record and \u2018offender demographic information\u2019 to inform two predictive  algorithms: OASys General Reoffending Predictor (OGP1) and OASys Violence Predictor (OVP1).54 A  2014 National Offender Management Service analysis found that the OGP1 and OVP1 generated  different predictions based on race and gender. They found that relative predictive validity was better  for white offenders than for Asian, black, or mixed ethnicity offenders. The Offender Group  Reconviction Scale (OGRS) is another algorithmic risk assessment tool, which is used in England and  Wales to assess and predict an offender\u2019s likelihood of reoffending.55 The OGRS algorithm uses data on the individual\u2019s official criminal history, as well as their age and gender, to produce a risk score  between 0 and 1 of how likely an offender is to reoffend within one or two years. \r\nThe use of these AI systems in a post-trial setting, and the documented differences in predictive  outcomes based on, among other factors, race, highlight the clear need for strict testing and  monitoring of such systems. These systems used in a post-trial setting could very easily be transferred  to a pre-trial risk assessment setting; the principles and aims of these systems and the data used are  very similar. For example, the COMPAS system, mentioned above and considered in more detail  below, was originally designed as a recidivism risk assessment tool, and is also used as a pre-trial risk  assessment tool. 56 \r\nWhere AI systems inform decisions on the deprivations of liberty, they should be calibrated to  generate outcomes that favour release, and they should not facilitate detention other than as a  measure of last resort. AI systems must be subject to rigorous testing to ensure they have the  desired effect of reducing rates of pre-trial detention rates. \r\nAI systems should be designed to be non-discriminatory \r\nOne of the most frequent criticisms of AI systems and their use in criminal justice systems is that they  can lead to discriminatory outcomes, especially along racial and ethnic lines.  \r\nThe best-known example of this is a study by the US media outlet ProPublica into COMPAS, a risk assessment tool designed to predict the likelihood of reoffending in Broward County in Florida.  ProPublica found that COMPAS was 77% more likely to rate black defendants as \u2018high-risk\u2019 than white  defendants, and it was almost twice as likely to mislabel white defendants as lower risk than black  defendants.57 \r\nThe dangers of the failure to adequately regulate the use of AI to prevent discrimination have also  been witnessed in Europe. The \u2018Crime Anticipation System\u2019 (\u2018CAS\u2019), a predictive policing software  being used across the Netherlands, was initially designed to consider ethnicity as a relevant factor for  determining the likelihood of a crime being committed. Amongst the indicators used by CAS to predict  crimes in a particular area was the number of \u2018non-Western allochtones\u2019 in the area \u2013 in other words,  \u2018non-Western\u2019 individuals with at least one foreign-born parent.58 The software not only presupposed  the existence of a correlation between ethnicity and crime, but also singled out a category of  ethnicities to be of particular concern, given that the presence of \u2018Western\u2019, \u2018autochtone\u2019 individuals  were not used as indicators. Furthermore, given that \u2018Western\u2019 was defined somewhat subjectively  (for example, including individuals of Japanese or Indonesian origin, and including all European  nationalities, apart from Turkish), CAS incorporated highly questionable societal categorisations and  biases. \r\nIn the United Kingdom, a major criticism of HART has been that it included data collated and classified  by a private company for marketing purposes that could very easily to biased outcomes. HART relied  on the \u2018Mosaic\u2019 code developed by a consumer credit reporting company, that categorised individuals  into various groups according to inter alia their ethnic origin, income, and education levels. It was of particular concern that some socio-demographic categories used by Mosaic were blatantly racialised,  including, for example, \u2018Asian Heritage\u2019, which stereotyped individuals of \u2018Asian\u2019 origin as being  unemployed or having low-paid jobs, and living with extended families.59 \r\nIn Denmark, an automated algorithmic assessment has been used to classify different  neighbourhoods, based on criteria such as unemployment, crime rates, educational attainment, and  other \u2018risk indicators\u2019, as well as whether the levels of first and second-generation migrants in the  population is more than 50%. Neighbourhoods which meet these criteria are classified as \u2018ghettos\u2019.  These neighbourhoods are then subject to special measures, including higher punishments for  crimes.60 It is clearly discriminatory, as well as entirely unfair, for people living in certain areas to be  punished more severely than others in different areas for the same crimes. \r\nFurther examples of criminal justice AI which have been identified as producing discriminatory  outcomes include the previously mentioned OASys, NDAS and the Gangs Matrix in the UK, and the  Netherland\u2019s ProKid 12.  \r\nThese examples illustrate the need for regulations to ensure that AI systems are designed to be non discriminatory, and to exclude categorisations and classifications that deepen and legitimise social  biases and stereotypes. However, policy makers should not assume that making AI systems blind to  all protected characteristics will always help to produce non-discriminatory outcomes. In certain  scenarios, the removal of protected characteristics from the data could worsen discrimination. For  example, it has been suggested on the basis of research into COMPAS in the United States, that  excluding gender as a variable for risk assessments would fail to reflect a well-established statistical  fact that in most countries, women are less likely to reoffend than men.61 Making COMPAS gender \r\nblind would unfairly and inaccurately assume women to be as equally likely to reoffend as men, and  discriminate against them by overestimating their risk scores.  \r\nRemoving visible biases from AI systems cannot be the sole or primary solution to their discriminatory  impact, because AI systems can be biased even if they have not been deliberately designed in that  way. Bias is often unintentional, and even if the AI system appears on the surface to be neutral, their  algorithms can lead to discriminatory assessments and outcomes. COMPAS, for example, does not  include race or ethnicity as a variable, yet research has found that it consistently gives black  defendants higher risk scores than their white counterparts, making them less likely to be released  from detention.62 \r\nHidden biases can arise in AI systems in numerous ways. Although a comprehensive analysis of how  they can cause unintentional biases are beyond the scope of this paper,63 the way in which AI systems are themselves created and built illustrate the difficulty, complexity, and sometimes impossibility, in  preventing discriminatory outputs and effects of AI systems.  \r\nThere are fundamental issues with the way AI systems are designed and created which can lead to  bias. Where the AI system is based on machine-learning, biases can result from faults in the data that  is used to train its algorithms. Machine learning systems \u2018learn\u2019 how to make assessments or decisions  on the basis of their analysis of data to which they have previously been exposed. However, the data  used to train a machine learning system might be incomplete, inaccurate, or selected for improper  reasons, and this could lead to AI systems producing unwanted outcomes. What amounts to  appropriate, good quality data for the purpose of training algorithms depends on what the machine  learning system is being designed to do,64 so it might not always be obvious which dataset is needed  to train algorithms to be non-discriminatory. \r\nAI designed or created for use in the criminal justice system will almost inevitably use data which is  heavily reliant on, or entirely from within, the criminal justice system itself, such as policing or crime  records. This data does not represent an accurate record of criminality, but is merely a record of  policing \u2013 the crimes, locations and groups that are policed within that society, rather than the actual  occurrence of crime. The data might not be categorised or deliberately manipulated to yield  discriminatory results, but it may reflect the structural biases and inequalities in the society which the  data represents.  \r\nWhere there are discriminatory policing patterns targeting certain demographics, or the systematic  under-reporting and systematic over-reporting of certain types of crime and in certain locations,65 the  use of such data merely results in a reinforcing and re-entrenching of those inequalities and  discriminationin criminal justice outcomes. For example, according to UK crime data, black people are  over 9 times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people,66 and black men are more  than 3 times more likely to be arrested than white men.67 Despite these statistics, NDAS (mentioned  above) in the United Kingdom explicitly relies on stop and search data to determine an individual\u2019s  propensity to commit a criminal offence. The fact that stop and search is disproportionately used  against black people means that there will inevitably be an overrepresentation of black people in NDAS  and that their risk levels will be inflated in comparison to white people.  \r\nComparable statistics on stop and search are not available in most EU Member States, where the  official collection of racially disaggregated criminal justice data is either forbidden by law, or not  standard practice. However, recent studies show that racially biased policing practices are prevalent  throughout the EU. Data collected from a survey by the Fundamental Rights Agency, for example, has shown that during a 5-year period, 66% of individuals of Sub-Saharan African origin in Austria, and  over half of respondents of South Asian origin in Greece were stopped and searched.68 \r\nAI built on data embedded with such biases and used to assist, inform, or make decisions in the  criminal justice system, can expand and entrench the biases represented in the data.69 When AI  systems result in criminal justice outcomes which repeat the discrimination inherent in the historic  data, such as targeting individuals from a particular demographic, that decision will itself be preserved  in the data. This leads to self-perpetuating \u2018feedback loops\u2019 which reinforce patterns of inequality.70 \r\nAnother way in which AI systems can produce unintentional biases is by way of proxies. Data used by  AI systems might be classified in seemingly legitimate ways, but those classifications can sometimes  act as proxies for protected characteristics. A common example used to illustrate this point is how  home addresses or postcodes can be proxies for race or ethnicity.71 Certain AI systems, such as HART,  were initially trained to find correlations between home addresses and the risk of reoffending \u2013 in  other words, to identify which postcode areas have \u2018higher-risk\u2019 residents than others.72 This approach  overlooks the fact that there is very pronounced ethnic residential segregation in many countries,73 making it highly probable in practice, for AI systems to inadvertently establish a link between ethnic  origin and risk. \r\nRoma are especially vulnerable to this form of proxy discrimination, given that in many EU Member  States, Roma are reported to live primarily in segregated areas inhabited mostly or exclusively by  Roma.74 \r\nThere are several ways in which AI systems can be designed to mitigate the risks of discrimination,  including by identifying and excluding data classifications that act as proxies for protected  characteristics.75 However, it can be difficult in practice to identify which variables are proxies for  protected characteristics (and how they do so), and removing too many \u2018offending\u2019 variables might  result in the AI system losing much of its functional utility.76 There is no one-size-fits-all method of  ensuring that AI systems do not produce discriminatory outcomes. Different approaches to de-biasing  AI systems can conflict with one another, and the suitability of a particular de-biasing method might  depend on the AI tool itself, and the legal and policy context in which it is designed to operate.77 Biases in AI systems are often not easy to detect and, in many cases, it might also be difficult to pinpoint  flaws either in the system itself, or in the training data that has been caused the bias. The structural  bias within the data that AI systems are built and operated on, a bias which is particularly deep-rooted  in criminal justice data, is a fundamental issue, and one which is likely to result in AI systems being  fundamentally inoperable \u2013 both because the bias makes them morally and ethically inoperable, if not  yet legally, and because any attempts to remove the bias will make the data to operate these systems  unusable.  \r\nFair Trials\u2019 view is that the only effective way in which AI systems can be regarded as non discriminatory is if they have been subject to rigorous independent testing for biases. These tests must  be mandated by law, must be independently run, have clearly stated aims or objectives, and be carried  out pre-deployment to reduce the likelihood of individuals being affected by discriminatory profiling  and decisions. AI can be tested in advance of deployment by using test data \u2013 datasets which are either  synthetic datasets,78 or by using historic data with permissions \u2013 running it through an AI system, and  analysing the outputs.79 For example, a trial of retrospective facial recognition video analysis is being  run by a police oversight Ethics Committee in the UK. The trial is using historic data \u2013 CCTV footage \u2013 \r\nas the basis for simulated investigations in a controlled environment, monitored by researchers. The  trial has clearly stated aims and signifiers of success, and all outcomes will be examined. There are  significant human rights, data protection and ethical concerns involved with this particular technology,  including the right to privacy, and the testing is not being conducted independently as it should be but, as above, there are positive aspects of the testing methodology.80 \r\nAn alternative could be to \u2018test\u2019 a system in a strictly academic sense by running it alongside actual  criminal justice processes, but with the system not having any effect on decision-making, and  analysing the system\u2019s proposed decisions or outcomes for bias.  \r\nAI should never be used or even \u2018tested\u2019 in real-world situations where they have actual effects on  individuals or criminal justice outcomes, before they have been tested. These types of tests also need  to be carried out in the broader context of an AI governance framework that not only analyses the  potential impact of the AI system pre-deployment, but also continues to monitor its impact  afterwards. \r\nIf these tests are not carried out, and/or if an AI system cannot be proven to be non-discriminatory, it  should be legally precluded from deployment. However, as explained in the final section of this paper,  it is questionable whether such tests are feasible in many Member States, where local laws prohibit  the collection of racially-disaggregated data.  \r\nAI systems should be developed to generate non-discriminatory outcomes, ensuring that suspects  and accused persons are not disadvantaged, either directly or indirectly, on account of their  protected characteristics, including race or ethnicity. AI systems should be subject to mandatory  testing before and after deployment so that any discriminatory impact can be identified and addressed. If an AI system cannot be proven not to generate discriminatory outcomes, it should not  be used. \r\nAI Systems need to be transparent and explainable \r\nAI systems can have a significant influence over criminal justice decisions, and they should be open to  public scrutiny in the same way that all decision-making processes by public entities should be.  However, a common criticism of many AI systems is that they lack transparency, which often makes it  difficult, if not outright impossible, to subject them to meaningful impartial analysis and criticism. This  lack of transparency is both as a result of deliberate efforts to conceal the inner workings of AI systems  for legal or profit-driven reasons, and of the nature of the technology used to build AI systems that is  uninterpretable for most, if not all humans.  \r\nThere are several reasons why it is necessary for AI systems to be transparent. Firstly, transparency is  essential for strengthening confidence of both primary users of the system, as well as the general  public, in AI systems. Democratic values demand that the public needs to be aware of how powerful  public institutions, such as the police and the judiciary, operate so that they can be held accountable  for their actions. It is also crucial for primary users of AI systems to understand how they work, so that  they can make informed decisions about how much influence they should have on criminal justice  decisions.  \r\nSecondly, decisions made by AI systems need to be contestable at an individual level. Standards on  the right to a fair trial and the right to liberty demand that defendants should have access to materials  that inform decisions regarding them, so that they can challenge the accuracy and lawfulness of those  decisions.  \r\nTransparency also acts as a safeguard against bias and inaccuracies. It is difficult to imagine how issues  that undermine the fairness and accuracies of AI systems (such as racial biases) can be detected, and  ultimately fixed, if they cannot be properly accessed and analysed. As explained above, certain AI  systems, such as CAS, have been found to have serious, but very obvious, flaws. In CAS\u2019s case,  however, the fault in the software could be detected easily, which meant that the discriminatory impact of the tool could be mitigated. The indicator for \u2018non-Western allochtones\u2019 in CAS was removed  in 2017,81 ostensibly because it served no useful purpose, but presumably also because of the very  obvious bias. This mitigation was possible because CAS is a transparent software, that was developed  in-house by the Dutch police. The types of indicators used to predict crime were made openly  available, and information about the method by which the software made predictions could easily be  accessed and understood.82 \r\nThis, however, is not the case for all AI systems, because AI systems are often developed by for-profit companies with little to no meaningful input from the public. As such, details of how they are  designed, and how they make decisions and assessments are, in many cases, closely guarded as trade  secrets that are protected by law.83 Often, AI systems are \u2018black boxes\u2019 because they are deliberately  kept that way. While it is accepted that strong, enforceable intellectual property laws are needed to  promote advancements in what is a very dynamic field of scientific research and innovation, it is not acceptable that these concerns trump the rights of individuals suspected or accused of crimes. In light  of this, it is concerning that the Commission\u2019s White Paper focuses on, and strongly promotes, the  concept of a \u2018partnership between the private and the public sector\u2019 in relation to AI.84 Fair Trials  appreciates that effective public-private collaboration could help to fill in gaps in public sector  expertise and capacity for the development of AI systems, but given the transparency challenges, it is  essential thatsuch partnerships are accompanied by robust regulations and rules that ensure effective  and open scrutiny.  \r\nHowever, even if AI systems are completely exposed to public scrutiny, and their source code85 and  input data, for example, are openly disclosed, there is still no guarantee that they will be sufficiently  transparent to enable adequate independent scrutiny. AI systems can be black boxes by nature of the  technology that makes their decision-making processes complicated beyond comprehension for most  (in some cases, too complicated even for computer scientists to understand).86 This is especially the  case where AI systems are based on machine-learning algorithms.  \r\nOne possible reason for the unintelligibility of AI systems is that they sometimes use machine-learning  algorithms that are simply too complex to be understood to a reasonable degree of precision.87 This  is especially the case where AI systems incorporate \u2018Deep Neural Networks\u2019 \u2013 a machine-learning  algorithmic architecture inspired by the structure and mechanics of human brains. Rather than relying  on a set of man-made instructions, these types of AI systems make decisions based on experience and  learning. Decision-making processes of this kind have been described to be \u2018intuitive\u2019, because they  do not follow a defined logical method, making it impossible to analyse the exact process by which a  particular decision is reached.88 It has also been suggested that some AI systems are uninterpretable  to humans because the machine-learning algorithms that support them are able to identify and rely  on geometric relationships that humans cannot visualise. Certain machine-learning algorithms are  able to make decisions by analysing many variables at once, and by finding correlations and geometric  patterns between them in ways that are beyond the capabilities of human brains.89  \r\nGiven these challenges, there is widespread recognition that states should require AI systems to not  only be \u2018transparent\u2019, but also explainable and intelligible.90 GDPR already recognises that individuals  should have the right to an explanation of how a decision was reached, if they have been subject to  an automated decision.91 In principle, this is an essential and very useful requirement, but it is also  one that seems difficult to implement in practice, given that both \u2018explainability\u2019 and intelligibility are  highly subjective concepts. Arguably, AI systems\u2019 computing processes are inherently difficult to  explain and understand for most people, including for most criminal justice decision-makers, but this  surely should not be the sole basis for oversimplifying the technology, or for banning the use of AI  outright.  \r\nComputer scientists have been theorising different ways of ensuring that decisions made through  complex algorithms can be explained and understood. An example is the \u2018explainable AI\u2019 movement  (\u2018xAI\u2019) that aims to build AI systems that can show more discernible links between inputted data and  decisions. xAI systems measure how each input influences the final decision, so it is possible figure out  how much weight is given to each input.92 This seems to be an innovative response to the \u2018black box\u2019  challenge, establishing clearer, more helpful relationships between inputs and final decisions.  However, it appears to fall short of explaining what happens between data being inputted into the  system and the final decision, and it does not enable users to impute any logic to the decision-making  process.93 \r\nAs explained above, there are various reasons why AI systems need to be transparent and intelligible,  but the effective of exercise of the rights of the defence must be recognised as a crucial test for  determining whether an AI system is sufficiently explainable and intelligible. AI systems have to be  designed in a way that allows criminal defendants to understand and contest the decision made  against them. Partnership for AI has suggested that a central factor that determines the contestability  of AI systems is the possibility of carrying out an audit trail of the AI decision.94 In particular, it has to  be possible for an auditor to follow and reproduce the process and come to the same conclusion  reached by the AI system at the end.  \r\nFurthermore, as explained in further detail below, criminal justice procedures should require the full  disclosure of all aspects of AI systems that are necessary for suspects and accused persons to contest  their findings, and this disclosure should be in a form which is understandable to a layperson, without  the need for technical or expert assistance. \r\nAI systems need to be transparent and explainable, so they can be understood and scrutinised by  their primary users, suspects and accused persons, as well as the general public. Commercial or  proprietary interests, or technical concerns, should never be a barrier to transparency. AI systems  must be designed in a way that allows criminal defendants to understand and contest the decision  made against them. It should be possible to carry out an independent audit, and processes should  be reproducible.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPart 2: Safeguards for the use of AI Systems in Criminal Proceedings \r\nAI systems have to be built in accordance with human rights principles, and to give effect to human  rights in practice, but it is unlikely that their design alone will guarantee that they are used in ways  that comply with human rights. Regulatory frameworks for the design and deployment of AI systems  have to be accompanied by appropriate legal safeguards that ensure they are used responsibly and  lawfully. There are two primary questions that need to be addressed: \r\n1) how procedural rules ensure that decision-makers do not over-rely on AI systems; and 2) how decisions and assessments made by AI systems can be analysed independently and  challenged. \r\nCombatting \u2018Automation Bias\u2019 and Reinforcing Meaningful Human Input \r\nOne of the main challenges of automated, or semi-automated decision-making systems is that of  \u2018automation bias\u2019 \u2013 the tendency to over-rely on automation in ways that can cause errors in decision making. Automation bias occurs primarily due to the perception that automated decision-making  processes are generally trustworthy and reliable. Automated cues have been found to be particularly  salient to decision-makers, and research has shown that users of automated decision-making systems  have a tendency to place greater weight on automated assessments over other sources of advice.95 \r\nThe disproportionate influence of automated systems can undermine the quality of decision-making,  by discouraging its users from consulting a wider range of factors that could inform more accurate  decisions.  \r\nMost AI systems currently being used to assist criminal justice decision-making do not completely  replace human decision-making. They are instead designed and deployed to be used as decision aids,  whose outputs are factored into consideration for the purposes of human decision-making. The  phenomenon of automation bias however, raises questions about whether AI systems are being used  in reality in accordance with their intended purpose as decision aids, and not as de facto replacements  for human decision-making processes.  \r\nThere is strong evidentiary basis for automation bias amongst pilots who, like judges and other  decision-makers in criminal justice proceedings, have typically been through a high level of training to  make appropriate decisions in highly complex settings.96 However, limited research into automation  bias amongst judges suggests that AI systems might have a more complex impact on judges\u2019  behaviour. For example, a study conducted in 2019 in Kentucky seems to suggest that the degree to  which judges rely on predictive tools for pre-trial detention decision-making could be influenced by  the ethnicity of the defendant.97 The research indicates that judges had a greater tendency to rely on  algorithmic risk assessments where the defendant was white, whereas in cases where the defendant  was black, judges were more likely to overrule the risk-assessment in favour of detaining them. This  study appears to show that AI systems can influence judges\u2019 behaviour in unpredictable ways,  especially where there are interactions or conflicts between automation and human biases, and that  AI systems might be an ineffective tool for challenging human prejudices. It is crucial that rules governing the use of AI systems in criminal proceedings actively try to counter  automation bias, and to encourage decision-makers to make independent determinations. A simple  requirement to have a human decision-maker \u2018in the loop\u2019 or to have a human decision-maker review  or check the automated decision is insufficient, because this risks overestimating the capacity or  willingness of human decision-makers to question and overrule automated decisions. A mere requirement to have an automated decision reviewed by a human, on its own, could reduce the  human review into a rubber-stamping exercise which, in practice, is no oversight at all.  \r\nIn recognition of this challenge, the European Data Protection Board has recommended that in order  for decisions to be regarded as not \u2018based solely\u2019 on automated processing for the purposes of Article  22 GDPR, there has to be \u2018meaningful\u2019 human oversight, rather than just a token gesture.98 What  qualifies as \u2018meaningful\u2019 intervention is open to interpretation, and it is likely to differ depending on  the circumstances and the type of decision being made. In the context of criminal justice procedures,  where decisions often have particularly severe and far-reaching implications for individuals\u2019 rights,  safeguards for ensuring meaningful human intervention have to be especially robust. \r\nProcedural safeguards that ensure \u2018meaningful\u2019 human oversight \r\nRules governing the use of AI systems in criminal justice proceedings have to counter automation  bias by encouraging human decision-makers to treat their processes with scepticism, and to force  them to challenge and scrutinise the outcomes of algorithmic assessments.  \r\nProcedural safeguards that can be put in place to tackle automation bias include: \r\na) making it a legal requirement for decision-makers to be adequately alerted and informed  about the risks associated with AI systems; \r\nb) making AI systems\u2019 assessments intelligible to decision-makers; \r\nc) requiring decision-makers to provide full, individualised reasoning for all decisions  influenced by an AI system; and \r\nd) making it easier for decision-makers to overrule AI assessments that produce unfavourable  outcomes for defendants.  \r\nOne way of ensuring that automated assessments and decisions do not have undue influence on  judicial decisions might be to ensure that decision-makers are sufficiently informed and alerted about  the risks of relying on AI systems. This seems to be the approach taken by the Wisconsin Supreme  Court in the United States in the case of Loomis,99 in which the Court considered whether or not the  use of the COMPAS risk assessment tool for sentencing purposes violated due process rights. The  judgment in Loomis recognises the importance of procedural safeguards as a way of safeguarding  fairness of decisions, by requiring the use of \u2018written advisements\u2019 to alert decision-makers about the  potential risks of AI risk assessments. Specifically, the court mandated that these advisements had to  include warnings that: a) the process by which the COMPAS produces risk scores were not disclosed  due to its \u2018proprietary nature\u2019; b) the accuracy of risk scores are undermined by the fact that COMPAS  relied on group data; c) the risk-assessment tool had never been tested locally for accuracy; d)  \u2018questions\u2019 have been raised about the discriminatory effect of COMPAS risk-assessments; and e)  COMPAS was developed to inform post-sentencing decisions, but not sentencing decisions  themselves. These warnings are clearly very specific to COMPAS and the context in which it is used in Wisconsin.  If similar safeguards were adopted in different contexts and with regard to different AI systems,  advisements will no doubt need to be adapted. The warnings used in Loomis have, however, been  criticised because they do not give enough information to decision-makers to enable them to  appreciate the degree to which these risk-assessments should be discounted.100 In particular, the  advisements are silent on the strength of the criticisms against COMPAS, and they say nothing about  the basis on which questions about their discriminatory effect have been raised.101 These warnings  also give no indication about likely margin of error of the assessment, so although judges are informed  that some assessments might be inaccurate, they are not in a position to appreciate how serious or  frequent these errors might be. \r\n\u2018Advisements\u2019, or warnings that encourage decision-makers to be sceptical of AI systems cannot be  considered as effective safeguards, unless they contain sufficiently helpful information for decision makers. However, even if judges are given stronger warnings than those in the Loomis advisements,  it is still doubtful whether they alone will adequately mitigate automation bias. One reason for this is  that many criminal justice decisions (such as pre-trial detention decisions) are, in practice, made very  routinely by judges. Although written advisements might initially help judges think more critically  about automated risk assessments, over time, these advisements could become repetitive and  routine, and lose much of the intended meaning and effect.102 \r\nAn effective safeguard that could work in conjunction with mandatory warnings could be for decision makers to be given a better insight into how AI systems produce a particular assessment or calculation.  As mentioned above, the lack of information about how assessments are made by AI systems makes  it harder for criminal defendants to scrutinise and challenge them. Surely, this has to be true also for  decision-makers. It is much harder, if not impossible, to analyse and criticise decisions if there is no  reasoning behind them. While AI systems do not rely on \u2018reasoning\u2019 per se, information given to  decisions about how a specific assessment was made, including what factors were relevant, and how  much weight was given to each factor could give decision-makers more confidence to decide whether  to agree or disagree with an AI-generated decision.  \r\nDecisions or assessments made by AI systems cannot be the sole basis of criminal justice decisions \u2013 they should be no more than a factor that can influence human-decision making. As such, decision makers should be required to show that decisions were influenced by a broader range of factors other  than the AI system, by way of fully reasoned, case-specific, written decisions. Research has shown that  the lack of case-specific reasoning in pre-trial detention decisions is already a serious challenge in  many EU Member States,103 and AI systems risk worsening the standardisation of such decision making processes. Where AI systems are used to inform pre-trial detention decisions, or any other  criminal justice decision that has a significant impact on the rights of the defendant, reasoned  decisions must be specific to the defendant\u2019s case, and in particular, they must reveal what which  factors influenced the decision, and to what degree. In particular, decisions have to make it clear how  much weight was given to assessments by AI systems. \r\nIt is also crucial that decision-makers are able to override decisions made by AI systems, and that they  are confident about doing so where the tool produces assessments or recommendations that are  unfavourable to the defendant (e.g. where the AI system advises against releasing the defendant). It  has been reported that members of the police force in Avon and Somerset Police in the United  Kingdom are expected to record incidences where they have disagreed with assessments made by a  predictive policing tool, and to explain their reasons for the disagreement.104 This is likely to act as a  strong disincentive for overriding decisions made by the AI system, and as such, it actively facilitates  automation bias. Furthermore, it seems to interfere with the presumption of innocence by making it  difficult for decision-makers to override AI systems to make decisions that favour the defendant. If an  AI system recommends the arrest or the detention of an individual, decision-makers should feel that  they have a genuine choice of overruling the AI system, and not be pressured into compliance.  Criminal justice decision-making processes should, as a general rule, be skewed in favour of the  defence to give effect to the presumption of innocence, and rules governing the use of AI systems  should favour favourable outcomes for defendants.  \r\nOn the other hand, in cases where a decision-maker acts against the advice of an AI system that  recommends a favourable outcome for the defendant, there should be a requirement for reasons to  be given for their decision. This is to prevent unfavourable outcomes for defendants that are  motivated by improper reasons, and to mitigate the risk of unconscious bias. \r\nChallenging AI in criminal proceedings \r\nAI systems need to be contestable by criminal defendants. This is so that they can not only challenge  the outcomes of the AI systems\u2019 calculations and analyses, but also scrutinise the legality of their use.  In other words, being able to challenge AI systems in criminal proceedings is not only a procedural  fairness requirement for defendants, it is also a means by which legal standards governing AI systems  and their use can be enforced.  \r\nOne of the major issues preventing the sufficient contestability of AI systems in criminal proceedings  is the lack of notification. If an individual is not notified that they have been subject to an automated  decision by an AI system, they will not have the ability to challenge that decision, or the information  that the decision was based on. \r\nFor example, in the United Kingdom, the Data Protection Act 2018 sets out the applicability of the  GDPR and sets out the UK\u2019s interpretations of the GDPR\u2019s requirements and safeguards. However, section 14 of the Data Protection Act significantly dilutes the requirements of Article 22 of the GDPR,  permitting purely automated decisions which have legal or similar significant effects on a data subject,  without their consent, as long as the data subject is subsequently notified that a purely automated  decision has been taken about them, after the decision has been made. It is only then that the data  subject has the opportunity to request a new decision.  \r\nHowever, it has been reported that individuals subject to decisions by the HART system in the UK are  not notified at all that they have been subject to such an automated decision, even after it has been  made.105 This is likely because under the Data Protection Act 2018, automated decisions which have  legal or similar significant effects on a subject are not necessarily classified as \u2018purely automated\u2019 if a  human has administrative input. In order to meet this requirement, the human input can be as minimal as checking a box to accept the automated-decision, even if it has a significant impact on an  individual, such as holding them in custody. This minimal requirement for human requirement means  that, in practice, decisions made with negligible to no meaningful human input can be classified as not  \u201cpurely automated\u201d and there is no legal requirement to notify and ability to request a new decision.  In this way, systems such as HART continue to be used, with people subject to their decisions  completely uninformed. \r\nWhile the GDPR already requires the notification of individuals affected by automated decisions, the  UK\u2019s experience with HART highlights the need for stricter rules to not only ensure meaningful human  input (as mentioned above), but to also strengthen the individual\u2019s right to be notified.  \r\nThere must be a requirement for individuals to be notified, not just for \u201cpurely automated\u201d decisions,  but whenever there has been an automated decision-making system involved, assistive or otherwise,  that has or may have impacted a criminal justice decision. This notification should include clear and  comprehensible information about the decision that has been taken, how that decision was reached,  including details of the information or data involved in reaching that decision, what the result or  outcomes of the decision are, and what effects, legal or otherwise they have, and information on how  to challenge that decision. \r\nAs discussed in the previous section, a further major barrier to the contestability of AI systems is a  technical one. The \u2018black box\u2019 nature of certain AI systems can be largely attributed to their design, so  it is important that there are rules governing the interpretability of these systems so that when they  are in use, their processes can be understood at all. However, there are also legal barriers to the full  disclosure of AI systems, which are often put in place to protect commercial interests. Procedural  safeguards play a particularly important and effective role in addressing these types of opacity  challenges. \r\nTransparency is a fundamental aspect of an adversarial process that underpins the right to a fair trial,  and human rights standards require that as a general rule defendants should be given unrestricted  access to their case-file,106 and to be given the opportunity to comment on the evidence used against  them.107 These standards are further reinforced by Directive 2012/13/EU,108 which requires Member  States to grant access to all material evidence in possession of the competent authorities to the  defence to safeguard the fairness of the proceedings and to enable defendants to prepare their  defence.109 The procedural requirement of an adversarial process is not one that is limited to  substantive criminal proceedings \u2013 it also applies in the context of pre-trial decision-making processes,  especially for decisions on the deprivation of liberty.110 While EU law and international human rights  law also recognise that there might be certain justifications for non-disclosure of materials used  against the defendant in criminal proceedings, these are narrow restrictions, and commercial interests  are not regarded as a valid justification for non-disclosure.111 Furthermore, EU law does not explicitly  recognise any derogations from the right of access to materials that are essential to challenging the lawfulness of an arrest or detention.112 In order for Member States to comply with these standards,  any exceptions to the disclosure of information regarding AI systems have to be applied very narrowly.  \r\nBarriers to scrutiny and accountability of AI systems are not only legal, but also technical. As explained  in previous sections, many AI systems suffer from interpretability issues because of their design and  by the nature of the machine-learning technology upon which they rely. In the absence of specific  expertise on AI, it is difficult to imagine how, in practice, defendants and their lawyers will be able to  challenge AI systems.  \r\nOne possible solution to this challenge, as explained below, is training for defence lawyers \u2013 but it is  unreasonable to expect lawyers to develop expertise that would enable them to analyse and scrutinise  AI systems at a technical level. A further solution could be that defence lawyers have access to the  relevant expertise from suitably qualified professionals. \r\nHowever, in reality, not all criminal suspects and accused persons are able to access the legal and  other technical assistance needed to understand and challenge technically complex AI systems, for  financial or other practical reasons. It would also be unreasonable and unrealistic to require all  suspects and accused persons to engage technical expertise just to be able to understand how an AI  system makes a decision, especially where AI systems are used routinely or mandatorily to make or assist criminal justice decisions. \r\nIt might seem unreasonable to expect all highly technical evidence to be challengeable by lay  defendants without the help of a suitable expert. However, AI systems are not necessarily used in  criminal proceedings as \u2018evidence\u2019, and in practice they could be an integral part of a decision-making  process, or even a replacement for it. As such, it is essential that the \u2018reasoning\u2019 of AI systems are  made known to suspects and accused persons, similarly to how judicial decisions must contain  \u201csufficient reasoning and address specific features of a given case\u201d, especially where they concern the  deprivation of liberty.113 Decision-making processes of AI systems and the way in which it has  produced an outcome in a particular case should thus be disclosed to suspects and accused persons,  in a form that is intelligible to a layperson. Individuals should not need to rely on experts to simply  understand how a decision affecting them was made. While there will inevitably be scenarios where  defendants would need expertise to challenge an AI-assisted decision, but these cases should be the  exception, rather than the norm, for whenever an AI system is used.  \r\nCriminal justice procedures should require the notification to suspects and accused persons where  an AI system has been used which has or may have impacted a decision made about that individual.  Procedures should enable the full disclosure of all aspects of AI systems that are necessary for  suspects and accused persons to contest their findings. Disclosure should be in a form which is  comprehensible to a layperson, without the need for technical or expert assistance, and suspects  and accused persons should also be given effective access to technical experts who can help to  analyse and challenge otherwise incomprehensible aspects of AI systems. \r\nTraining \r\nAI systems use technology not well understood by many people. Without proper training, outputs of  AI systems might not be easy to interpret, and it might be difficult to appreciate which factors  undermine the reliability of AI systems, so that appropriate weight can be attached to their findings.  As mentioned above, decision-makers can be warned about the weaknesses of AI systems as part of their decision-making process, but the effectiveness of this safeguard can be questioned, because it is  unlikely to provide decision-makers with all the information they need, and there is no guarantee that  the warnings will be taken seriously in all cases.  \r\nTraining is not just needed for the primary users of AI systems, such as judges and police officers who  use them to inform their own decisions. The training must also be available criminal defence lawyers,  so that they are in a better position to challenge AI systems, where necessary. If AI systems are used  routinely to aid criminal justice decisions or even made mandatory (as is the case in certain states in  the United States), there would be strong justification for governing bodies to make training on AI  mandatory for criminal justice practitioners.\r\n\r\nPart 3: Governance and Monitoring \r\nCriminal justice processes are an important enforcement mechanism for ensuring that AI systems are  designed and used lawfully, but they cannot be the sole, or even the primary means of implementing  legal and ethical standards. Of equal, if not greater importance is a framework that ensures that policy  decisions on the design and deployment of AI systems are made in systematised way, and that  unlawful or harmful AI systems never enter into public service. Member States that deploy AI systems  for criminal justice purposes should have regulatory mechanisms that are fit for purpose. At a  minimum, these should include frameworks for: a) pre-deployment impact assessments; b) post deployment monitoring and evaluations; and c) collection of data needed for effective comparative  analysis.  \r\nPre-Deployment \r\nBoth the GDPR and LED recognise the need for AI systems to be analysed before they are deployed,  so that they comply with existing regulatory and human rights standards. Under Article 35 GDPR,  Member States are required to carry out a \u2018Data Protection Impact Assessment\u2019 (\u2018DPIA\u2019) for data  processing systems that carry out \u2018a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating  to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling and on which decision  are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the  natural person\u2019. The corresponding provision in the LED is Article 27, which similarly calls for DPIAs to  be carried out where processing of data is likely to result in a \u2018high risk to the rights and freedoms of  natural persons\u2019. DPIAs under both laws have to carry out inter alia an assessment of the possible  impact of the data processing system on the rights or individuals, and they need to mention what  measures will be in place to ensure that their rights are properly protected.  \r\nDPIAs help to address a serious accountability challenge, but EU laws do not provide sufficiently  helpful standards on how they should be conducted. Article 27 LED does not lay down minimum  requirements for how DPIAs should be carried out. On the other hand, there are aspects of Article 35  GDPR which, if used to guide how DPIAs should be conducted for AI systems used in criminal justice,  would raise concerns. The foremost challenge is the level of transparency mandated by the GDPR.  DPIAs are envisaged largely as internal processes led by the data controller, who may seek the opinions  of data subjects (such as members of the public or their representatives), where it is \u2018appropriate\u2019 to  do so. The GDPR also explicitly recognises that the requirement to seek the views of data subject is  \u2018without prejudice to the protection of commercial interests\u2019.114 \r\nAs outlined above, transparency is a key aspect of a fair criminal justice system and, as a general rule,  all criminal justice decision-making processes need to be open to public scrutiny. There is no reason  why AI systems should be exempt from this requirement and, given that administration of criminal  justice is a matter of strong public interest, the public should have the right to voice their opinions and  raise objections whenever AI systems impact criminal justice processes. Also, given the highly  technical nature of AI systems, and their (as yet) poorly understood impact on society, impact  assessments must have multi-disciplinary expert engagement. 115 In particular, DPIAs should always  involve independent experts (computer scientists, in particular) who can audit, analyse, and if  possible, \u2018explain\u2019 AI systems, so that they can help legal, policy and social science experts to  determine the likely implications for the individuals\u2019 rights. \r\n\r\nFor public and expert consultations to be meaningful and effective, sufficient information should be  made available to interested parties so that the AI system can be thoroughly understood and  researched. Partnership on AI has recommended that for criminal justice risk-assessment tools,  training datasets,116 architectures and algorithms of AI systems should be made available to ensure  meaningful scrutiny.117 Commercial interests should not be regarded as a legitimate ground for  limiting the disclosure of this information.  \r\nSecondly, Article 35 GDPR allows data controllers to carry out a single DPIA \u2018for a set of similar  processing operations that present similar high risks\u2019. There is a danger that this provision could be  interpreted too broadly if Member States are given free rein to determine what two systems can be  regarded as sufficiently \u2018similar\u2019. There are risks in assuming that an AI system well-suited for use in a  particular context or within a particular geographic area will be equally useful in another. AI systems  built using data from one jurisdiction might not be able to reflect differences in, for example, law  enforcement culture and patterns of behaviour, laws and policies, and socio-demographic  characteristics of another jurisdiction.118 Sometimes, these differences can be seen in the same  country or even within the same region. For example, a study of \u2018PRECOBS\u2019 a predictive policing tool  used in Baden-Wurttemberg in Germany, found significant differences in predictive utility between  rural and urban areas.119 \r\nFinally, DPIAs seem to require data controllers to theorise the possible impact of AI systems, but there  is no strict requirement for AI systems to be subject to testing or auditing before, or immediately after  deployment. This overlooks the fact that flaws in AI systems, including unintentional biases, are not  always easily detectable, and that they might only surface once the system is put into operation. As  discussed earlier, the causes of biases in AI systems can be difficult to identify, and it is difficult to  appreciate how, short of thorough testing, the true impact of AI decisions can be known.  \r\nIn New York, the AI Now Institute has proposed an alternative model for impact assessments, known  as \u2018Algorithmic Impact Assessments\u2019 (\u2018AIAs\u2019).120 The AIA framework sets out in detail how public  authorities should conduct impact assessments of AI systems, and it can be contrasted with the  provisions of the GDPR in that AIAs place much greater emphasis on the need for community  engagement and consultations with external experts. This framework could serve as a useful guide for  Member States seeking to establish pre-deployment procedures for approving AI systems.  \r\nAI systems should not be deployed unless they have undergone an independent public impact  assessment with the involvement of appropriate experts, that is specific both to the purpose for  which the AI system is deployed, and the locality where it is deployed. AI systems must be tested  for impact pre-deployment, and systems should be precluded from deployment until they have  undergone this testing and achieved minimum standards, such as non-discrimination. \r\nPost-Deployment \r\nImpact assessments of AI systems should not be regarded as \u2018one-off\u2019 processes. They have to be  followed up with ongoing post-deployment monitoring and evaluation, so that the longer-term impact of AI systems can be understood, and shortcomings and biases that affect the rights of  individuals can be identified and fixed.  \r\nThe ability of AI systems to deliver fair and just outcomes, and to meet policy objectives can be difficult  to predict from the outset. Although AI systems can be validated and tested prior to deployment to  check if they are likely to produce desired outcomes, their impact in the real world might be different.  Furthermore, even if the likely outputs of AI systems can be predicted, it is much harder to estimate  the likely impact they will have on human decision-making.121 \r\nFurther reviews of AI systems are also necessary because criminal justice systems and the societies in  which they operate change over time. A study in the United States, for example, theorises that many  pre-trial risk assessment tools might be making predictions based on historic data that is no longer fit  for purpose. It has been suggested that because data used to train risk assessment algorithms pre \r\ndate bail reforms in many US jurisdictions, the impact of recent measures introduced to reduce the  risk of failure-to-appear, such as transportation assistance and text message alerts are not taken into  consideration \u2013 potentially leading to over-incarceration.122 Socio-demographic changes might also  require AI systems to be altered so that they continue to be fit for purpose. If, for example, an area  experiences high levels of net migration which results in rapid changes to policing patterns and judicial  behaviour, AI systems might need to be reviewed to make sure they are not unintentionally worsening  racial discrimination.  \r\nData Collection \r\nIt is difficult to imagine how the impact of AI systems can be assessed, if there is inadequate data to  support effective monitoring. The deficiency of criminal justice data across the EU has been subject to  criticism. In particular, Fair Trials has found that most EU Member States do not systemically collect  statistics on the duration of pre-trial detention, outcomes of criminal cases of pre-trial detainees, and  the likelihood of a suspect or accused person being released by the court.123 The data needed for  effective monitoring and evaluation depends on the function of the AI system and its intended  objectives, but the lack of criminal justice data more generally questions whether Member States  currently have adequate legal and policy foundations for introducing AI systems responsibly into  criminal justice processes. Data needed for monitoring and evaluation purposes will, of course, need  to have been collected from well before the introduction of the AI system, so that a proper pre- and  post- analysis comparison can be made.  \r\nOf particular concern is that in most EU Member States, race or ethnic data on criminal justice is not  available, either because there is no systemised process for collecting it, or because local laws ban this  practice altogether.124 This is a serious challenge because the most predominant criticism against the  use of AI systems in the United States and elsewhere is that it worsens racial and ethnic bias in criminal  justice decisions. Even without official statistics, there is strong evidence in many EU Member States  that certain ethnic minorities, and in particular, Roma and people of colour are unfairly  overrepresented in criminal justice systems.125 It is worrying that AI systems might worsen this  discrimination, but that there will be no way of detecting this trend, because of the lack of data.  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the absence of racial and ethnic data could also prevent pre-emptive measures to  combat racial bias. It is doubtful that developers will be able to design systems free from racial bias, if  they have no data against which to measure their performance.  \r\nOn data collection, Fair Trials believe that EU and its Member States will need to make a strict choice.  Either they should ensure that racially disaggregated criminal justice data is collected, or AI systems  should be banned where they make individualised assessments for criminal justice purposes. \r\nEffective monitoring of AI systems is not possible unless there is sufficient data that makes it  possible to discern their real impact. In particular, Member States need to collect data that allow  them to identify discriminatory impacts of AI systems, including discrimination on the basis of race  and ethnicity.\r\n"}

Phase 2 trials continue to assess safety but also evaluate the product\u2019s\neffectiveness and common short-term side effects or other risks associated with the\nproduct. Phase 2 trials are also used to determine the optimal dose of the product. For\nvaccines, phase 2 assesses how much of the vaccine to administer and on what dosing\nschedule (e.g., whether a boost is needed to maximize its effectiveness or whether the\nvaccine must be administered on a regular schedule to maintain immunity). As with phase\n1 studies, phase 2 studies are carefully controlled. However, phase 2 involves a larger\n(though still relatively limited) number of volunteer subjects\u2014generally no more than a\nfew hundred participants.\n\uf0b7 Phase 3 Trials. Phase 3 trials involve an expanded number of participants\u2014from several\nhundred to thousands\u2014and are used to assess the product\u2019s safety and effectiveness\nacross a wide range of patient categories through controlled and uncontrolled studies.\nThese trials are intended to present a clearer picture of expected risks and benefits under\nreal-world conditions. The information obtained from phase 3 trials also forms the basis\nfor the product\u2019s labeling.\nSponsors must generally complete all three phases to obtain FDA approval unless they obtain accelerated\napproval, in which case FDA requires post-approval trials to confirm the expected clinical benefit. FDA\nmay also require, at its discretion, additional clinical trials after approval (i.e., phase 4 trials) for any approved product to continue assessing the product\u2019s safety and effectiveness once on the market."}

Code. (Although the District of Columbia has its own criminal code, its criminal justice system has some overlap with the federal system and is\nsubject to the President\u2019s clemency power.)\nSeveral factors limit the scope of the pardon. First, it applies only to violations of federal and D.C. law\nand does not affect other state law marijuana offenses. In announcing the pardon, President Biden also\nencouraged state governors to take similar steps but, under the United States\u2019 federalist system of\ngovernment, the President has no direct power to change state law or compel the states to adopt federal\npolicies.

We are keeping consumers at the center of our innovation and marketing investments, while also leveraging our expertise in revenue growth management and execution. Our growth culture is leading to new approaches, more experimentation, and improved agility to drive growth and value for our stakeholders.\u201d Highlights Quarterly / Full-Year Performance \u2022 Revenues: For the quarter, net revenues were strong, growing 7% to $10.1 billion. Organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 15%. Organic revenue (non-GAAP) performance was strong across operating segments and included 12% growth in price/mix and 2% growth in concentrate sales. The quarter included one additional day, which resulted in a 1-point tailwind to revenue growth. The quarter also benefited from the timing of concentrate shipments. For the full year, net revenues grew 11% to $43.0 billion, and organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 16%. This performance was driven by 11% growth in price/mix and 5% growth in concentrate sales. \u2022 Operating margin: For the quarter, operating margin, which included items impacting comparability, was 20.5% versus 17.7% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 22.7% versus 22.1% in the 1 prior year. For the full year, operating margin, which included items impacting comparability, was 25.4% versus 26.7% in the prior year, while comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 28.7% in both the current year and the prior year. For both the quarter and the full year, operating margin benefited from strong topline growth but was unfavorably impacted by the BODYARMOR acquisition, higher operating costs, an increase in marketing investments versus the prior year, currency headwinds and items impacting comparability. \u2022 Earnings per share: For the quarter, EPS declined 16% to $0.47, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) was even at $0.45. EPS performance included the impact of a 12-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of an 11-point currency headwind. For the full year, EPS declined 3% to $2.19, and comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 7% to $2.48. EPS performance included the impact of an 11-point currency headwind, while comparable EPS (non-GAAP) performance included the impact of a 10-point currency headwind. \u2022 Market share: For both the quarter and the full year, the company gained value share in total nonalcoholic readyto-drink (\u201cNARTD\u201d) beverages, which included share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels. \u2022 Cash flow: Cash flow from operations was $11.0 billion for the full year, a decline of $1.6 billion versus the prior year, as strong business performance was more than offset by the deliberate buildup of inventory in the face of a volatile commodity environment, cycling working capital benefits from the prior year, and higher tax payments and annual incentive payments in 2022.

What are the different ways a cell can be affected by necrosis?", "context_document": "The stages of cell death differ depending on how a cell dies. When it comes to cell death, there are two main types to consider: Necrosis Vs. Apoptosis. Each of these involves a distinct process and has a distinct impact on the rest of the body.It holds utmost significance for researchers and they must choose the best Cell Separation technologies to get high-quality results.\n \n\n What is Cell Apoptosis?\n Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is a normal growth and development mechanism within an organism. Because the cell participates in its own death, this process is also known as \u201ccellular suicide.\u201d Apoptosis contributes to the balance of cell multiplication. Uncontrolled cell growth will result in tumors and other problems if cells continue to reproduce without apoptosis.\n \n\n What Causes Apoptosis?\n Apoptosis is also known as programmed cell death because it is usually triggered by self-generated signals within a cell. It is a normal part of the cell cycle that begins with mitosis in cell reproduction. Caspases, enzymes found in all cells that cleave specific proteins to initiate cell death, mediate this process.\n \n\n Apoptosis Steps\n Apoptosis occurs in a gentle and controlled manner that has no negative impact on surrounding cells. A cell will expel moisture in order to dry out and condense until fragmentation occurs. Because the cell does not release into the extracellular environment, there are no morphological changes. Apoptotic bodies are small vesicles that form to transport the contents of the cell elsewhere. This enables cells to die gently and without causing inflammation. Apoptosis is signaled by chromatin condensation in a cell\u2019s nucleus. This allows scientists to determine whether a cell is dying naturally or unnaturally.\n \n\n What is Cell Necrosis?\n Necrosis is a type of cell death that occurs when cells are exposed to extreme conditions. Cells may sustain damage to their internal environment when not under normal conditions. Tissues may deteriorate quickly and harshly. As a result, necrosis is commonly defined as unintentional cell death.\n \n\n Causes of Necrotic Cell Death\n External factors influencing the physiology of cells in the body cause necrosis. The following are some examples of necrotic cell death causes:\n \n\n Bacterial infection \u2013 Bacteria are microscopic organisms that can cause infections in the body if they enter through an airway or an open wound. They may be responsible for a variety of illnesses linked to unplanned cell death.\n Fungal infection \u2013 A fungus infection, also known as mycosis, occurs when any fungus infiltrates human tissues. This could result in skin or internal system diseases, as well as unprogrammed cell death.\n Pancreatitis \u2013 Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas, a gland in the body that helps regulate hormones and digestion.\n Protein denaturation \u2013 Protein denaturation occurs when weak bonds in proteins break down, causing the cells\u2019 ability to function properly to suffer.\n Apoptosis Vs. Necrosis\n While both necrosis and apoptosis are mechanisms involved in multicellular organism cell death, they can be distinguished in a variety of ways. Apoptosis is regarded as a naturally occurring process, whereas necrosis is regarded as a pathological process. Pathological processes are often unregulated and are caused by toxins, infections, or traumas. Apoptosis is controlled and timely, making it predictable and beneficial to the host.\n \n\n Read Also: T Cell Isolation:A Comprehensive Guide to the Key Components\n \n\n The distinction between apoptosis and necrosis is also visible in the following factors:\n \n\n Process \u2013 Apoptosis is characterized by the shrinking of the cytoplasm, which results in the condensation of the nucleus. Necrosis occurs when the cytoplasm and mitochondria swell, resulting in cell lysis or a rupture in the cell membrane.\n Membrane Integrity \u2013 Blebbing is a defining feature of apoptosis. Blebbing occurs when a cell\u2019s cytoskeleton degrades and the membrane bulges outward. Apoptotic blebs can form when cytoplasmic capsules detach from dying cells. This has no effect on the membrane\u2019s integrity. The integrity of the membrane is loosened and thus significantly reduced, if not completely lost, during necrosis.\n Organelle Behavior \u2013 Organelles can continue to function even after a cell has died due to apoptosis. Organelles swell and disintegrate during necrotic cell death. After necrosis, organelles are no longer functional.\n Scope of Affected Cells \u2013 Apoptosis is a localized process that only destroys individual or single cells. Necrosis can spread to affect adjacent cell groups, causing damage beyond the initial site.\n Bodily Influence \u2013 Apoptosis is involved in controlling cell numbers and is frequently beneficial. Apoptosis, on the other hand, can cause diseases if it becomes abnormal in either direction. Necrosis, on the other hand, is always harmful and, if left untreated, can be fatal.\n In essence, apoptosis is planned cell death in which the cell actively destroys itself in order to maintain body functionality. Necrosis is an unintentional or unplanned cell death caused by the cell\u2019s external environment, which impedes or interferes with body functions or health.\n \n\n Dangers of Cell Death in a Sample\n Cell enrichment assays can be hampered by both Necrosis & Apoptosis. The goal of studying a cell population is to collect as many healthy target cells as possible. Damaged cells do not behave the same as healthy cells and thus produce insufficient results. When collecting and storing cell samples, the longer a cell is kept outside of its preferred environment, the more likely it will die from necrosis. Cells can swell and die as a result of external factors. Dead cells can clump and cause more cell death in the surrounding population when using traditional cell separation methods such as magnetic-based cell sorting.\n \n\n It is critical to follow protocols, use gentle cell separation methods, and use additional products for increased downstream accuracy to maintain cell health and purity during cell separation assays.\n \n\n Harnessing Pluriselect\u2019s Innovative Technology: Plurispin and PluriBead\n The first method for reducing cell death is to use a gentler isolation method. Traditional separation technologies, such as magnetic bead-based sorting, can be harsh on cells and result in less-than-desirable outcomes. Let\u2019s see what Plurispin and PluriBead can do for us.\n \n\n Plurispin\n The pluriSpin system is a new negative cell isolation technology that can be used to isolate cells directly from whole blood, buffy coat, or cord blood. This new method isolates viable, untouched, and highly purified cells in a single step without the use of magnets or a column. As a result, there is less chance of activating or damaging the cells of interest.\n \n\n PluriBead\n PluriBead is a unique cell separation technology that does not rely on magnetic components. The steps are straightforward: Your pluriBeads (containing bound target cells) are sieved through a strainer; the pluriBeads containing your target cells remain on top, while the unwanted cells pass through. You have your target cells ready after detaching.\n \n\n Ready to get started?\n Stop wasting your valuable samples on inefficient processes and see the difference for yourself. Pluriselect\u2019s innovative technology provides an incredibly fast, simple workflow that allows you to confidently move to downstream processing.", "full_prompt": "[question]\n What are the steps to apoptosis?

Apoptosis is regarded as a naturally occurring process, whereas necrosis is regarded as a pathological process. Pathological processes are often unregulated and are caused by toxins, infections, or traumas. Apoptosis is controlled and timely, making it predictable and beneficial to the host.\n \n\n Read Also: T Cell Isolation:A Comprehensive Guide to the Key Components\n \n\n The distinction between apoptosis and necrosis is also visible in the following factors:\n \n\n Process \u2013 Apoptosis is characterized by the shrinking of the cytoplasm, which results in the condensation of the nucleus. Necrosis occurs when the cytoplasm and mitochondria swell, resulting in cell lysis or a rupture in the cell membrane.\n Membrane Integrity \u2013 Blebbing is a defining feature of apoptosis. Blebbing occurs when a cell\u2019s cytoskeleton degrades and the membrane bulges outward. Apoptotic blebs can form when cytoplasmic capsules detach from dying cells. This has no effect on the membrane\u2019s integrity. The integrity of the membrane is loosened and thus significantly reduced, if not completely lost, during necrosis.\n Organelle Behavior \u2013 Organelles can continue to function even after a cell has died due to apoptosis. Organelles swell and disintegrate during necrotic cell death. After necrosis, organelles are no longer functional.\n Scope of Affected Cells \u2013 Apoptosis is a localized process that only destroys individual or single cells. Necrosis can spread to affect adjacent cell groups, causing damage beyond the initial site.\n Bodily Influence \u2013 Apoptosis is involved in controlling cell numbers and is frequently beneficial. Apoptosis, on the other hand, can cause diseases if it becomes abnormal in either direction. Necrosis, on the other hand, is always harmful and, if left untreated, can be fatal.\n In essence, apoptosis is planned cell death in which the cell actively destroys itself in order to maintain body functionality. Necrosis is an unintentional or unplanned cell death caused by the cell\u2019s external environment, which impedes or interferes with body functions or health.\n \n\n Dangers of Cell Death in a Sample\n Cell enrichment assays can be hampered by both Necrosis & Apoptosis. The goal of studying a cell population is to collect as many healthy target cells as possible. Damaged cells do not behave the same as healthy cells and thus produce insufficient results. When collecting and storing cell samples, the longer a cell is kept outside of its preferred environment, the more likely it will die from necrosis. Cells can swell and die as a result of external factors. Dead cells can clump and cause more cell death in the surrounding population when using traditional cell separation methods such as magnetic-based cell sorting.\n \n\n It is critical to follow protocols, use gentle cell separation methods, and use additional products for increased downstream accuracy to maintain cell health and purity during cell separation assays.\n \n\n Harnessing Pluriselect\u2019s Innovative Technology: Plurispin and PluriBead\n The first method for reducing cell death is to use a gentler isolation method. Traditional separation technologies, such as magnetic bead-based sorting, can be harsh on cells and result in less-than-desirable outcomes. Let\u2019s see what Plurispin and PluriBead can do for us.\n \n\n Plurispin\n The pluriSpin system is a new negative cell isolation technology that can be used to isolate cells directly from whole blood, buffy coat, or cord blood. This new method isolates viable, untouched, and highly purified cells in a single step without the use of magnets or a column. As a result, there is less chance of activating or damaging the cells of interest.\n \n\n PluriBead\n PluriBead is a unique cell separation technology that does not rely on magnetic components. The steps are straightforward: Your pluriBeads (containing bound target cells) are sieved through a strainer; the pluriBeads containing your target cells remain on top, while the unwanted cells pass through. You have your target cells ready after detaching.\n \n\n Ready to get started?\n Stop wasting your valuable samples on inefficient processes and see the difference for yourself. Pluriselect\u2019s innovative technology provides an incredibly fast, simple workflow that allows you to confidently move to downstream processing.\n https://uberstrainer.com/necrosis-vs-apoptosis-necrotic-cell-death-processes-apoptosis-steps/?srsltid=AfmBOorXdBv0i9nIoJj0a0EJSaMNsEfUera9WQT93AqxIR9fd5FupZMu\n \n\n =====================\n \n\n [instruction]\n Answer the question using only the information provided in the context.

In most cases, they note that their \u201ccommon\r\nsense\u201d instinct is that too much exposure to violent video games must\r\nhave some sort of negative effect on their children, but that they have\r\nread in the media that \u201cthe jury is still out\u201d on violent media effects or\r\nthat there is no convincing evidence that violent video game playing is\r\nharmful. Confusion around this conflict will often prompt them then to\r\nask: \u201cwhat does the scientific evidence really say?\u201d In this chapter we\r\nshow that the common sense view is backed up by a substantial body\r\nof recent scientific findings. Helpful and pro-social video game content\r\nhas great potential for enhancing the lives of children and adolescents,\r\nbut exposure to anti-social and violent video game content increases\r\nthe likelihood of a range of negative outcomes, with greater exposure\r\nincreasing the risk.\r\nVideo games have been around for nearly 50 years. Kirsch (2010)\r\nnotes the first as being Spacewar (released in 1962), a game in which two\r\nspaceships battle to the death in space. Although the graphics were very\r\nsimple compared to modern games, the theme of battling to the death\r\nis one that has endured through the ensuing five decades.\r\nAccording to the most recent comprehensive poll by the Kaiser\r\nFoundation, American children aged 8\u201318 play an average of eight\r\nhours of video games per week, an increase of over 400 per cent from\r\n1999 (Rideout, Foehr & Roberts, 2010). Playing is heaviest in the 11\u201314\r\nage group, with boys outplaying girls more than 2.5 hours to 1. A recent\r\nstudy suggests that around 99 per cent of American boys play video\r\ngames, along with 94 per cent of girls (Lenhart et al, 2008). It is common\r\nfor US children and adolescents to play more than 20 hours per week\r\n56Chapter in W. Warburton & D. Braunstein (Eds.) Growing Up Fast and\r\nFurious: Reviewing the Impacts of Violent and Sexualised Media on\r\nChildren, (pp. 56-84). Annandale, NSW, Australia: The Federation Press.\r\nand it is not uncommon for males to play 40 hours or more per week\r\n(Bailey, West & Anderson, 2010). On average, Australian 7\u201318-year-olds\r\nplayed somewhat less than their US counterparts in 2007 (4.7 hours per\r\nweek: see ACMA, 2007), but this figure could have risen substantially\r\nin recent years if Australian children have followed the steep upward\r\ntrend found in the latest US studies.\r\nThe types of games vary, but content analyses by Dill and colleagues\r\n(2005) show that the majority of top selling video games and children\u2019s\r\nfavourite games contain violence, and often strong violence. More\r\nrecently, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 grossed ~$USD 550 million in\r\nthe first five days of its 2009 release, at that time more than any other\r\nentertainment product in history (movies included). Next on the list\r\nin 2009 was Grant Theft Auto IV (GTA), with ~$USD 500 million in\r\nfive days. Even more recently (a year is a long time in the video game\r\nworld) Call of Duty: Black Ops grossed $USD 360 million in a single\r\nday, breaking all records (Ortutay, 2010). According to Wikipedia, the\r\nmassive multiplayer online game (MMOG) World of Warcraft has more\r\nthan 12 million online subscribers and thus currently grosses more\r\nthan $USD 180 million per month (at $15 per month per player). GTA,\r\nwhich is rated M17+ in the United States and involves such activities\r\nas going on murderous rampages, having sex with prostitutes and then\r\nmurdering them to retrieve the money paid, has been played by 56 per\r\ncent of United States children aged 8\u201318 (Rideout et al, 2010). Clearly, a\r\nlarge number of children and adolescents are exposed regularly to video\r\ngames with high levels of violence and anti-social themes. This makes\r\nit important for parents, educators and professionals who work with\r\nchildren to have some knowledge of their effects.\r\nBefore turning to the negative effects of violent video games\r\nhowever, it is important to stress that video games can have many\r\nhelpful benefits. Here are just a few.\r\nHelpful effects of video games\r\nPain management\r\nKirsch (2010) notes that various media, including video games, can be\r\nused to distract and relax children during painful medical procedures.\r\n57\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\nCoordination and spatial cognition\r\nA number of studies reveal that video games which require the place-\r\nment of objects within a screen (such as Tetris) can enhance the spatial\r\ncognition abilities of players (that is, the ability to mentally arrange\r\nand rotate objects in three dimensions). Indeed, video game playing\r\nhas been linked with a wide array of visual and spatial skills, primarily\r\nthrough practice effects (see Green & Bavelier, 2006; Okagaki & Frensch,\r\n1994; see also Bailey et al, 2010, for a review). In one study by Gopher,\r\nWeil and Bareket (1994), the flight performance of Israeli Air Force\r\ncadets who had been trained on the Space Fortress II video game was\r\ncompared with the performance of an untrained group. The trained\r\ncadets performed better in almost all aspects of flight performance and\r\nas a result the game was incorporated into the Israeli Air Force training\r\nprogram.\r\nPro-social behaviour\r\nAlthough this area of study is still in its infancy, there is mounting\r\nevidence that video games which model and involve participants in pro-\r\nsocial, helping behaviours can lead to increases in pro-social behaviour\r\nin the short and long term. Most notably, Gentile et al (2009) found that\r\nelementary school students exposed to pro-social video games were\r\nmore helpful than those exposed to violent or non-social video games.\r\nIn a second longitudinal study of Japanese children in grades 5, 8 and 11,\r\nexposure to pro-social video games at the start of the study was linked\r\nwith increased pro-social behaviour some months later, even when the\r\nbaseline pro-social tendencies of children were statistically removed.\r\nIn a final study of Singaporean secondary school students, the amount\r\nof pro-social video game play experienced was correlated with helping\r\nbehaviour, cooperation, sharing and empathy. A study by Greitemeyer\r\nand Osswald (2009) found that pro-social video game playing led to a\r\nshort-term reduction in the tendency to see the world as hostile and an\r\nimmediate reduction in anti-social thoughts.\r\nEducation\r\nA considerable literature reveals video games to be a powerful teaching\r\ntool (eg, Barlett et al, 2009; Murphy et al, 2002; Swing & Anderson,\r\n58\r\ngrowing up fAsT And furious\r\n2008). They have been used to teach algebra (Corbett et al, 2001), biol-\r\nogy (Ybarrondo, 1984), photography (Abrams, 1986), and computer\r\nprogramming (Kahn, 1999), to teach children how to manage diabetes\r\n(Lieberman, 2001; 2006) and to teach specific skills using simulators\r\n(for example, by Qantas pilots, NASA and the Air Force). Gentile and\r\nGentile (2008) describe the educational advantages of using video games\r\nas teaching tools. These include the power of video games to engage\r\nchildren and to \u201cencourage children to persevere in acquiring and\r\nmastering a number of skills, to navigate through complex problems\r\nand changing environments, and to experiment with different identities\r\nuntil success is achieved\u201d (p 127).\r\nExercise\r\nThere has been a recent explosion in the popularity of video games that\r\npromote physical activity and exercise (that is, \u201cExergames\u201d). Games\r\nsuch as Wii Sports Heart Rate; Wii Fit; Wii Play; Wii FitPlus; Dance, Dance\r\nRevolution and Just Dance seem to be part of a recent trend that has seen\r\nan increase in the availability and popularity of non-violent, helpful\r\ngames.\r\nClearly, video games have considerable potential to enhance the\r\nlives of children and adolescents. Unfortunately, excessive video game\r\nplaying, especially of violent video games, has the potential to impact\r\nchildren in a number of negative ways.\r\nHarmful effects of video games\r\nVideo game addiction\r\nIn his moving biography, Unplugged: My Journey into the Dark World of\r\nVideo Game Addiction, Ryan Van Cleave describes the way that a violent\r\nonline game, World of Warcraft, dominated his life to such an extent\r\nthat he was unable to function normally and was driven to the verge of\r\nsuicide. Video game addiction is now taken so seriously by psychologists\r\nand psychiatrists that it was recently considered for inclusion in the fifth\r\nedition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders\r\n(DSM) as a diagnosable psychiatric disorder and has been lodged in its\r\nappendix to encourage further research. It is clear that many children\r\n59\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\nplay video games at a \u201cpathological\u201d level that causes damage to family,\r\nsocial, school or psychological functioning (see Anderson et al, 2012).\r\nFor example, it has been found that 8.5 per cent of 8\u201318-year-old US\r\nvideo game players do so at pathological levels (Gentile, 2009). Similar\r\nstudies have found figures of 11.9 per cent in Europe (Grusser et al,\r\n2007), 8.7 per cent in Singapore (Choo et al, 2010), 10.3 per cent in\r\nChina (Peng & Li, 2009) and 4 per cent for 12\u201318-year-olds in Norway\r\n(Johansson & G\u00f6testam, 2004), with a further 15.5 per cent \u201cat risk\u201d.\r\nAs will be seen in the ensuing sections, the amount that children\r\nplay video games is very important. Those who play excessively are not\r\nonly at risk of a number of negative outcomes, they are also much more\r\nlikely to be playing violent games (see Krah\u00e9 & M\u00f6ller, 2004).\r\nAttention deficits\r\nThere are some studies linking the amount of time children spend play-\r\ning video games to attention deficits, impulsivity and hyperactivity (see\r\nBailey et al, 2010; Swing et al, 2010). For example, Gentile (2009) found\r\nthat adolescents who used video games at pathological levels were\r\nnearly three times more likely to be diagnosed with Attention Deficit\r\nDisorder or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder than adolescents\r\nwho played at non-pathological levels. In a landmark paper, Swing and\r\ncolleagues (2010) examined the effect of video game playing on atten-\r\ntion in elementary school children. They used a longitudinal study that\r\nstatistically controlled for a range of other factors that could also lead to\r\nattention problems and found that amount of time spent playing video\r\ngames predicted increases in teacher assessments of attention deficits\r\nin the children 13 months later. These results suggest that the children\u2019s\r\nlevel of video game playing played a causal role in their subsequent loss\r\nof attentional capacity.\r\nAnderson et al (2012) believe that on theoretical grounds some\r\nvideo games should have less effect on attentional problems (for exam-\r\nple, those that require controlled thought and planning) and that those\r\nwhich require constant reactive behaviours from players (a common\r\nfeature of many violent first person shooting games for example)\r\nmay be more problematic in terms of children developing attentional\r\ndifficulties.\r\n60\r\ngrowing up fAsT And furious\r\nSchool performance\r\nIt is well established that spending longer hours playing video games\r\nis linked with poorer school performance for both children and adoles-\r\ncents (Anderson et al, 2007; Chan & Rabinowitz, 2006; Chiu et al, 2004;\r\nCordes & Miller, 2000; Gentile, 2009; Gentile et al, 2004; Sharif & Sargent,\r\n2006). One explanation for this is a simple displacement of time \u2013 hours\r\nspent playing video games eats into time that would normally be spent\r\nstudying and reading. For example, in a study of 1491 youth between\r\n10 and 19, gamers spent 30 per cent less time reading and 34 per cent\r\nless time doing homework (Cummings & Vandewater, 2007). It is also\r\npossible, however, that children who perform more poorly at school are\r\nalso more likely to \u201cspend more time playing games, where they may\r\nfeel a sense of mastery that eludes them at school\u201d (Anderson et al,\r\n2012). Of course, another possibility is the that excessive gaming creates\r\nattention deficits, which in turn can lead to poorer school performance.\r\nIncreased aggression\r\nShould we be concerned about children and adolescents playing violent\r\nvideo games? Can this lead to aggressive behaviour? Over 98 per cent of\r\npaediatricians in the United States have considered these questions and\r\nbelieve that excessive violent media exposure has a negative effect on\r\nchildhood aggression (Gentile et al, 2004). Similarly, there is a consen-\r\nsus amongst the vast majority of violent video game researchers that\r\ntoo much exposure to violent video games increases the likelihood of\r\naggressive thoughts, feelings and behaviours, leads to desensitisation\r\nto violence and also leads to decreases in pro-social behaviours and\r\nempathy (Anderson et al, 2010; Huesmann, 2010). There are, however,\r\na small number of researchers who dispute this evidence and it seems\r\nthat the views of this small minority have had a large impact on public\r\nperceptions (Anderson & Gentile, 2008; Dill, 2009). In this section of the\r\nchapter we will broadly examine the arguments for this view and then\r\nreview the scientific evidence that does find violent video game effects.\r\nIn this way, we hope that readers can judge the evidence for themselves.\r\n1. The first argument against violent video game effects is that there\r\nis little evidence linking the playing of violent video games to very\r\nviolent behaviours (such as school shootings). To better understand\r\n61\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\nthis argument it is helpful to reflect on the difference between aggres-\r\nsion and violence. In essence, violence is aggressive behaviour that\r\nhas extreme harm as its goal (Anderson & Bushman, 2002). Thus, all\r\nviolence is aggression but not all aggression is violence. With this in\r\nmind we make four points.\r\n(a) Ethically it is not possible to use the most powerful methods \u2013 experi-\r\nmental manipulations \u2013 to test the causal link between violent video\r\ngames and violence because we cannot rightfully incite people to\r\ncause extreme harm in a laboratory. There are, however, ways to\r\ntest links with aggressive behaviour, which can be examined ethi-\r\ncally in a laboratory. It is disingenuous to suggest that because there\r\nare no experimental studies that randomly assign children to years\r\nof playing violent or nonviolent video games and then measure\r\nwhich group commits the most violent crimes, that therefore there\r\nare no established negative or anti-social effects. This is like saying\r\nthat because there are no experimental studies on humans showing\r\nthat cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, smoking is not a causal\r\nrisk factor. The causal links between violent video game playing\r\nand physical aggression are, in our opinion, well established.\r\n(b) Cross-sectional (correlational) studies and longitudinal studies\r\nof violent video game effects have established significant links to\r\nviolent behaviour. Several longitudinal studies in particular\r\nprovide strong evidence that these are causal effects.\r\n(c) Aggressive behaviour, which can include bullying, hurting other\r\npeople physically, hurting other people\u2019s property or relationships\r\nand hurting people verbally, is a very important social phenomenon\r\nin its own right. Aggression does not have to escalate into violence\r\nto be harmful and destructive.\r\n(d) No aggression researchers claim that media violence is the sole or\r\neven the most important source of violent behaviour. The most\r\ncommon approach, and the one taken by the authors, is the \u201crisk\r\nfactor\u201d approach. According to this approach, people can have vari-\r\nous risk factors for aggression or violent behaviour (see Figure 1).\r\nThese might include coming from a violent home, having a violent\r\npeer group, high levels of trait aggression, exposure to violent\r\nmedia and a number of other factors. The more risk factors that are present for a person, especially when they are present from a\r\nyoung age, the more likely that person is to be aggressive or violent.\r\nStrasburger (2009, p 203) notes that:\r\nThe research on media violence and its relationship to real-life\r\naggression is clear: young people learn their attitudes about violence\r\nat a very young age, and once learned, those attitudes are difficult\r\nto change (Anderson et al, 2003; Bushman & Huesmann, 2006).\r\nConservative estimates are that media violence may be causing 10%\r\nof real-life violence \u2013 not the leading cause by any means, but an\r\nunhealthy chunk that we could do something about if we chose to\r\n(Strasburger et al, 2009; Comstock & Strasburger, 1990).\r\nWe believe that Victor Strasburger is right. Many risk factors for\r\naggression and violence are very hard to deal with as parents, as\r\neducators, as professionals and as policy-makers. Media violence,\r\nthough, is one risk factor that can be controlled and about which\r\naction can be taken from the level of the individual home through to\r\nthe level of State and federal governments. This makes the research\r\non media violence effects particularly important.\r\n2. Detractors of the view that playing violent video games increases\r\nthe likelihood of aggressive behaviour also criticise the methodology\r\nof video game studies and of meta-analyses of these studies. It is to this\r\nimportant scientific evidence that we now turn.\r\nFigure 1: Some longitudinal factors for youth violence\r\nAdapted from US Department of Health and Human Services (2001), Bushman and\r\nHuesmann (2006) and Anderson et al (2010).\r\n63\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\nWhat is a meta-analysis and what evidence do the\r\nmeta-analyses provide?\r\nA meta-analysis is a statistical technique whereby scientific studies that\r\ntest the same or a similar hypothesis (for example, that violent video\r\ngame exposure compared to neutral video game exposure will result in\r\nincreased aggression) and the same or a similar outcome (for example,\r\naggressive behaviour) are combined to ascertain the strength (\u201ceffect\r\nsize\u201d) of the average finding. To date there have been a number of meta-\r\nanalyses of the effect of violent video games on aggressive thoughts,\r\nfeelings and behaviours. In particular, studies by Distinguished\r\nProfessor Craig Anderson and Dr Chris Ferguson have received a lot of\r\npublicity in recent years and it is valuable to compare them.\r\nDr Ferguson, a vocal critic of the research demonstrating a link\r\nbetween violent video game playing and aggression, along with video\r\ngame industry representatives, claims that violent video game research\r\nis methodologically flawed and that mainstream media violence\r\nresearchers selectively report biased findings. Dr Ferguson has also\r\nsuggested that Professor Anderson\u2019s meta-analyses have a \u201cpublication\r\nbias\u201d that undermines their results. Dr Ferguson cites his own three\r\nmeta-analyses that examine the question of whether violent video game\r\nplaying increases subsequent aggression. These examined 24, 17 and 14\r\npublished papers, encompassing 25, 21 and 15 separate tests of the same\r\nhypothesis respectively (Ferguson 2007a, 2007b; Ferguson & Kilburn,\r\n2009). In total, 4205 and 3602 participants were tested in the first two\r\nmeta-analyses (the number cannot be determined for the most recent\r\nstudy but is assumed to be lower). Dr Ferguson found a positive relation-\r\nship between violent video game exposure and aggressive behaviour,\r\nwith effect sizes of .29, .14 and .15 respectively. He then inappropriately\r\n(according to some meta-analysis experts, see Bushman, Rothstein, &\r\nAnderson, 2010) \u201ccorrected\u201d for publication bias using a controversial\r\nstatistical procedure called \u201ctrim and fill\u201d that reduced these effect\r\nsizes. Such a procedure guesses what unpublished studies might be out\r\nthere and adds these guesses to the averaging procedure. Based on the\r\n\u201ccorrected\u201d figures, Dr Ferguson concluded there was no effect of violent\r\nvideo games on aggressive behaviour. These three meta-analyses, which\r\nuse highly overlapping subsets of the same small sample of studies, are\r\n64\r\ngrowing up fAsT And furious\r\nwidely cited as the strongest evidence that violent video game playing\r\ndoes not increase the likelihood of aggressive behaviour.\r\nEvidence that playing violent video games does increase the likeli-\r\nhood of aggression comes from many researchers. Professor Anderson\r\nand his colleagues have themselves conducted a large number of such\r\nstudies and have also summarised the available studies in three compre-\r\nhensive meta-analyses, the first in 2001 (Anderson & Bushman, 2001),\r\nthe second in 2004 (Anderson et al, 2004) and the most recent in 2010\r\n(Anderson et al, 2010). The latter paper was co-authored by Professor\r\nHannah Rothstein, an expert in meta-analyses and publication bias.\r\nThis paper detailed major shortcomings in the Ferguson meta-analyses\r\n(which failed to include numerous relevant studies) and included all\r\nrelevant studies then known. Data from 136 articles, 381 separate\r\ntests of hypotheses, and across a massive sample of 130, 296 participants\r\nwere analysed. In this large, all-inclusive meta-analysis, research\r\nmethodology was also examined. Among the many findings was that\r\nstudies with better research methods tended to find stronger effects of\r\nviolent video game playing on aggressive behaviour.\r\nWe present a summary of the findings in Figure 2 (over page). We\r\nunderstand that the concept of effect size is a hard one to grasp without\r\na detailed knowledge of statistical procedures, so we will provide some\r\ncomparison data afterwards to help readers make sense of the results.\r\nThe middle bar shows the effect found, the bars on either side reflect\r\nhow variable the findings were in the studies tested.\r\nFigure 2 shows several meta-analyses. Each tests a different hypoth-\r\nesis. All hypotheses are tested as outcomes of exposure to violent video\r\ngames, and these outcomes include aggressive behaviour, aggressive\r\nthoughts (cognitions), aggressive feelings (affects), physiological arousal,\r\ndesensitisation to violence/low empathy and pro-social behaviour.\r\nAs can be seen, the average effect across these many studies was one\r\nwhereby exposure to violent video games led to an increase in aggressive\r\nbehaviours, aggressive thoughts, aggressive feelings and physiological\r\narousal (which is linked to aggressive behaviour), to desensitisation\r\nto violence and decreased empathy, and to a reduction in pro-social\r\nbehaviours.\r\nIt is important to note that these findings come from a range of\r\nstudy types \u2013 experimental studies in which all participants have exactly the same experience other than the media type they experi-\r\nence, correlational studies of the links between levels of violent video\r\ngame playing and various types of aggressive behaviours in real life,\r\nand longitudinal studies that follow video game playing patterns and\r\nbehavioural patterns in the same people over time.\r\nEach study type makes a unique contribution to what we know.\r\nExperiments can be used to infer that one thing causes another, but it is\r\nharder to generalise these findings to \u201creal life\u201d. Correlational studies\r\ninvolve \u201creal life\u201d behaviours and can test alternative hypotheses, but\r\nit is difficult to determine the causal direction of relationships found\r\n(that is, whether playing violent games causes aggression or whether\r\naggressive people choose violent games). Longitudinal studies are real\r\nworld studies and can be used to find whether one thing causes another\r\nover time in a person\u2019s life. Some media violence studies have followed\r\nthe same people for over 40 years (eg, Huesmann et al, 2003) and have\r\nvery detailed data. Because links between violent video game playing and aggression are found consistently across all three study types, the\r\nevidence converges to suggest both a causal link and an effect that is\r\nfound in the real world.\r\nThe Anderson et al (2010) meta-analysis also found that when\r\nproper statistical methods are used, there was no evidence of systematic\r\npublication bias in the studies. The rather weak evidence of publication\r\nbias produced by Dr Ferguson was likely the result of several factors,\r\nincluding failure to use all of the relevant studies and the combining of\r\ncross-sectional and experimental studies in the publication bias analysis.\r\nTo understand how strong the obtained violent video game effect\r\non aggression is, it can be helpful to get a sense of what the \u201ceffect size\u201d\r\nnumbers actually mean. It is easy to understand that a higher number\r\nmeans a stronger effect, but it is much harder to know how a big a\r\nnumber needs to be before it is considered important. Figure 3 shows\r\nsome effect sizes for well known phenomena that can be used as points\r\nfor comparison.\r\nAs can be seen from Figure 3, violent video game effects are larger\r\nthan the effect of eating calcium on bone mass, of asbestos inhalation\r\nFigure 3: The comparative effect sizes of violent video game\r\neffects and other well known phenomena\r\n* From Best Practices studies, Anderson et al, Psychological Bulletin, 2010.\r\n67\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\non related cancers, of condom use on reducing HIV infection numbers,\r\nof taking aspirin on reducing heart attacks and a range of other very\r\nimportant phenomena. Clearly, the size of violent video game effects is\r\nlarge enough to be considered socially important.\r\nA final finding from the Anderson et al (2010) meta-analyses is that\r\nthe violent video game effects occurred for both males and females,\r\nand across low-violence collectivistic Eastern countries (for example,\r\nJapan) and high-violence individualistic Western countries (for example,\r\nAustralia and the United States). This is not a surprising finding, as other\r\nreviews have found that violent video games affect people regardless\r\nof age, gender, socio-economic status, game genre and game system\r\n(Barlett et al, 2009). In fact, to the knowledge of the authors, no group\r\nhas yet been identified that are immune to the effects of exposure to\r\nviolent media such as video games (see Anderson et al, 2003).\r\nPerhaps the best brief summary of the evidence presented here\r\nis articulated in a statement produced by 13 researchers into violent\r\nvideo game effects (including the authors of this chapter), prepared for\r\nan amicus curiae (friend of the court) brief for the Schwarzenegger and\r\nBrown v Video Software Dealers Association and Entertainment Software\r\nAssociation case in the Supreme Court of the United States (Docket #\r\n08-1448). This statement was supported as being accurate by a further\r\n102 well-respected researchers in this area.\r\nStatement on Video Game Violence\r\nBoth the American Psychological Association (APA, 2005) and the\r\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP, 2009) have issued formal\r\nstatements stating that scientific research on violent video games\r\nclearly shows that such games are causally related to later aggressive\r\nbehavior in children and adolescents. Extensive research has been\r\nconducted over many years using all three major types of research\r\ndesigns (experimental, cross-sectional, and longitudinal). Numerous\r\noriginal empirical research studies have been conducted on children\r\nand adolescents. Overall, the research data conclude that exposure\r\nto violent video games causes an increase in the likelihood of aggres-\r\nsive behavior. The effects are both immediate and long term. Violent\r\nvideo games have measurable and statistically significant effects on\r\nboth males and females. Theoretically important effects of violent\r\nvideo games have been confirmed by many empirical studies. The\r\neffects have been replicated by researchers in different settings and\r\nin numerous countries. The psychological processes underlying\r\n68\r\ngrowing up fAsT And furious\r\nsuch effects are well understood and include: imitation, observa-\r\ntional learning, priming of cognitive, emotional and behavioral\r\nscripts, physiological arousal, and emotional desensitization. These\r\nare general processes that underlie all types of social behavior, not\r\njust aggression and violence; they have been confirmed by count-\r\nless studies outside of the media violence domain. In addition to\r\ncausing an increase in the likelihood of aggressive behavior, violent\r\nvideo games have also been found to increase aggressive thinking,\r\naggressive feelings, physiological desensitization to violence, and to\r\ndecrease pro-social behavior.\r\nImportantly, this statement alludes to the psychological processes that\r\nare known to underlie the effect of exposure to violent video games\r\non children. These are worth examining in more detail because they\r\nalso provide some insight as to why the effects of violent video games,\r\ncompared to other violent media, may be stronger.\r\nThe psychology of violent video game effects on children\r\nMost of the explanations related to violent video game effects involve\r\ndifferent types of learning. Because of certain features of violent video\r\ngame playing \u2013 interactivity, repetition and the actual playing of the\r\nrole of aggressor \u2013 the effects may be stronger and patterns of behaviour\r\nbetter learned.\r\nImitation\r\nHumans seem to be hard-wired from birth to imitate others. Recently\r\ndiscovered \u201cmirror neurons\u201d in humans and primates represent one\r\nmechanism in the brain that may facilitate this (Caggiano et al, 2009;\r\nGallese et al, 1996; Rizzolati et al, 1996; Umilta et al, 2001). Imitation has\r\nbenefits, including the fast learning of important behaviours, and plays\r\na role in human bonding. However, imitation of unhelpful and anti-social\r\nbehaviours can have clear negative effects for the individual and for\r\nsociety. We know that children will imitate aggressive behaviours,\r\neven if the behaviours are totally new to the child and are not seen to\r\nbe rewarded in any way (Bandura, 1965; 1973; Bandura et al, 1961; 1963a,\r\n1963b).\r\nWe also know that children imitate characters from the media they\r\nsee, with some characters more likely to be imitated than others \u2013 those\r\nthat are attractive, heroic, rewarded for their behaviour or liked, or that\r\nhave high social status. In violent video games the central characters\r\n69\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\noften meet several of these criteria. Does this mean, though, that people\r\nwill copy the behaviours of the characters in very violent games such\r\nas GTA and others? It is possible. For example, an 18-year-old youth\r\nin Thailand stabbed a taxi driver to death trying to \u201cfind out if it was\r\nas easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game\u201d (Reed, 2008). As\r\na result, GTA IV was banned in Thailand. In 2003 William Buckner, 16,\r\nand his step-brother Joshua, 14, killed a man and seriously wounded a\r\nwoman shooting at cars in Tennessee (Calvert, 2003). The boys claimed\r\nthey were acting out the game Grand Theft Auto III. Also in 2003, Devin\r\nMoore, an 18-year-old from Alabama, killed three police officers follow-\r\ning his arrest for a carjacking. On being re-arrested he is reported to\r\nhave told police that \u201cLife is like a video game. Everybody\u2019s got to die\r\nsometime\u201d (Leung, 2005). Again, the killer told police he was copy-\r\ning behaviour he had learned playing GTA III. We are not suggesting\r\nthat violent video game playing alone was causal in these crimes. As\r\nnoted earlier, numerous risk factors influence the likelihood of aggressive\r\nand violent b ehaviour, and the most severe forms of violence virtually\r\nalways require the convergence of many risk factors. Furthermore, it is\r\ndifficult (perhaps impossible) to identify which risk factors were crucial\r\nto any particular aggressive or violent act. Nonetheless, imitation of media\r\nviolence seems to have played some role in these cases.\r\nThere are numerous other stories of aggressive behaviours that\r\nseemingly imitate violent video games. These are easily accessed on\r\nthe internet with a simple search. Clearly, for some violent video game\r\nplayers, simple imitation may play a causal role in some acts of\r\naggression. However there are a number of other factors, also linked with\r\nimitation and learned aggression, that may also be important.\r\nIdentification\r\nAlthough media effects can occur without the person identifying with\r\nany of the characters they have seen, identifying with an aggressor has\r\nbeen shown to increase the likelihood of adopting aggressive behav-\r\niours and attitudes (Cantor, 1994; Huesmann & Eron, 1986; Huesmann\r\net al, 2003). People are more likely to identify with a character who is\r\nperceived as similar, heroic and attractive (Hearold, 1986; Heath et al,\r\n1989), and are more likely to identify with and believe realistic portray-\r\nals because they are easier to relate to personal experiences (Berkowitz\r\n70\r\ngrowing up fAsT And furious\r\n& Alioto, 1973; Feshback, 1972; Geen, 1975). In violent video games, the\r\nplayer strongly identifies with (and usually takes the role of) the aggres-\r\nsor. The aggressive central character is usually glorified and portrayed\r\nas heroic and, in recent years, the portrayal of aggressive characters in\r\nvideo games has become increasingly realistic (Gentile et al, 2007). For\r\nthese reasons, identification with violent/aggressive characters may be\r\na key way that video games impact on children.\r\nRepetition\r\nIt is well established that repetition of behaviours establishes them\r\nin memory, increases skill and automates them as learned responses\r\n(eg, Gentile & Gentile, 2008). Further, repeating an entire behavioural\r\nsequence commits it to memory better than repeating only part of a\r\nsequence (Gentile et al, 2007). Violent video games are much more\r\nrepetitive than other forms of violent media and more often involve\r\nthe repetition of complete behavioural sequences (Gentile et al, 2007).\r\nPlayers repeat the same behaviours and receive similar rewards\r\nthroughout the game, experience similar thoughts and feelings during\r\nthose actions and are exposed to the attitudes espoused in the game\r\nimplicitly and explicitly (for example, sleeping with prostitutes and then\r\nmurdering them to retrieve one\u2019s money in GTA implies misogyny, the\r\nacceptance of violence to get what one wants and that human life has\r\nlittle value). Simply put, the repetitive nature of violent video games is\r\nideal for learning aggressive attitudes and scripts for behaviour.\r\nInteractivity\r\nActive participation assists learning as it requires attention, and closely\r\nattending to a task assists people to memorise the relevant behaviours\r\nand knowledge (Gentile et al, 2007; Gentile & Gentile, 2008). Violent\r\nvideo games are highly interactive, and the recent development of home\r\nconsoles that allow players to use realistic weapons such as replica guns\r\nand swords further increases the level of interactivity and decreases the\r\ngap between game playing behaviours and \u201creal world\u201d behaviours.\r\nThe combination of interactivity and frequent rehearsal is a potent\r\none for learning. In essence, this is a key reason that video games are\r\nsuch powerful tools for teaching pilots, astronauts and soldiers their\r\ncore skills. These factors give video games tremendous potential for\r\n71\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\npro-social pursuits and as learning tools, but have less welcome implica-\r\ntions regarding the interactive rehearsal of anti-social and aggressive\r\nbehaviours.\r\nLack of negative consequences\r\nAnother basic tenet of learning theory, demonstrated across thousands\r\nof studies, is that people are more likely to behave in ways that are\r\nrewarded and less likely to behave in ways that are punished. In terms of\r\nimitation, children imitate aggression they perceive as being rewarded\r\nmore often than aggression they perceive as resulting in punishment.\r\nInterestingly, children will imitate unpunished aggression as often as\r\nrewarded aggression (eg, see Bandura, 1973).\r\nWith these facts in mind, it is relevant that most acts of violence in\r\nvideo games:\r\n(a) go unpunished;\r\n(b) are rewarded (for example, by points, money, status and eleva-\r\ntion to higher game levels);\r\n(c) have unrealistic consequences for the victim.\r\nWith relation to the final point, it is important for parents and profession-\r\nals to note that seeing victims suffer realistic and negative consequences\r\nas a result of media violence should reduce the likelihood of subsequent\r\naggression because pain cues usually inhibit aggressive behaviour\r\n(Baron, 1971a, 1971b, 1979). Also note, however, that in some circum-\r\nstances pain and suffering cues can increase aggressive behaviour (see\r\nBerkowitz, 1993, p 174).\r\nAssociative learning\r\nAs noted in Chapter 1, the brain is a neural network in which concepts,\r\nideas, feelings and memories are stored and interconnected. The way\r\nthis network \u201cwires up\u201d depends on what people experience, with\r\npaired experiences (such as the smell of fresh coffee, pleasure and a\r\ncraving for a hot beverage) becoming more strongly wired together the\r\nmore they are experienced together. This means that people learn to\r\nassociate one thing with another.\r\nIn media generally, and in violent video games especially, many\r\nthings are frequently paired and thus become \u201cwired\u201d together. For\r\n72\r\ngrowing up fAsT And furious\r\nexample, guns are rarely used for any purpose other than violent action.\r\nThis is why there is a well demonstrated \u201cweapons effect\u201d, whereby\r\nthe simple sight of a weapon increases the likelihood of aggression if\r\nthe person has mentally paired a weapon such as a gun with killing or\r\nhurting people rather than with a non-aggressive use such as sports\r\nshooting (Bartholow et al, 2005; Berkowitz & LePage, 1967; Carlson et\r\nal, 1990). This suggests that children who often play video games where\r\nthere is frequent weapon use for the purpose of killing and hurting\r\nothers are more likely to be aggressive immediately after playing the\r\ngame and are more likely to be aggressive when exposed to a weapon\r\nof a similar type in real life.\r\nAssociative learning also explains why whole sequences of behav-\r\niour are learned during video game play and why the acquisition of\r\naggression-related knowledge structures is so important.\r\nAcquisition of aggressive knowledge structures, attitudes and\r\nscripts for behaviour\r\nClearly, violent video games are powerful teachers, but what is the\r\noutcome of such learning for the individual child? In essence, the child\r\n(and adult for that matter) internalises clusters of associated knowledge\r\nabout aggressive behaviour (knowledge structures or \u201cschemas\u201d), as\r\nwell as attitudes about aggressive behaviour and \u201cscripts\u201d for how to\r\nbehave in certain circumstances.\r\nSchemas and scripts contain knowledge about an aspect of living,\r\nmental links to related attitudes, feelings and memories, and a repertoire\r\nof associated behaviours. Scripts additionally contain information about\r\nhow commonly experienced situations \u201cplay out\u201d (such as visiting a\r\nsupermarket) and the typical sequence of behaviours in that situation\r\n(entrance at the left of the store, grab a trolley, milk at the back, bread in\r\nthe second aisle, line up and pay). Schemas and scripts are activated by\r\na trigger (for example, the supermarket logo) and, once active, help to\r\ndirect our behaviour, often without our being aware of it. Children start\r\nto develop schemas about the world as toddlers (and perhaps earlier)\r\nand these can sometimes be aggressive in nature.\r\nIn relation to the development of aggressive knowledge structures\r\nand attitudes, there is considerable evidence that exposure to violent\r\nmedia (including violent video games):\r\n73\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\n(a) increases attitudes approving of aggressive behaviour as a\r\n\u201cnormal\u201d social response (Huesmann, 1998);\r\n(b) increases mental access to scripts for resolving conflict that\r\ninvolve aggressive behaviour and reduces access to conflict-\r\nsolving scripts that are non-aggressive (Bushman & Anderson,\r\n2002; Huesmann, 1998);\r\n(c) underpins the attitude that aggression is (1) exciting and (2)\r\nincreases one\u2019s social status (Groebel, 1998);\r\n(d) increases the belief that the world is a frightening place (Cantor,\r\n2003; Donnerstein et al, 1994);\r\n(e) increases a hostile attributional bias whereby ambiguous but\r\ninnocent behaviours by others are interpreted as deliberately\r\nhurtful (Anderson et al, 2010; M\u00f6ller & Krah\u00e9, 2009); and\r\n(f) increases the likelihood of aggressive behaviour (Anderson et\r\nal, 2010).\r\nRegrettably, children are exposed to a lot of violent media. As noted in\r\nChapter 1, by the age of 18, most US children will have seen many tens\r\nof thousands of murders and acts of violence on television alone. Heavy\r\nplaying of violent video games that involve frequently killing of other\r\npeople or creatures would add greatly to those figures, especially for\r\nmurders. This means that for a lot of children, violent media influences\r\nmay result in higher levels of aggressive schemas, fear about the wider\r\nworld, hostile and anti-social attitudes, and scripts for behaving aggres-\r\nsively, than might otherwise occur without those influences.\r\nFictitious violence versus real violence\r\nRecent brain imaging studies, in which children\u2019s brain activation\r\npatterns are \u201cphotographed\u201d by fMRI machines whilst they are expe-\r\nriencing violent media, have shown that even when children know the\r\nviolence they are watching is fictitious or fantasy violence, their brains\r\nrespond to the violence as if there was a real threat (Murray et al, 2006;\r\nsee also Weber et al, 2006). In addition, long-term memory systems were\r\nactivated, suggesting that this effect could endure beyond the initial\r\nexposure. This research suggests that fantasy media violence seems to\r\nhave a similar impact on children as exposure to realistic media violence. The General Aggression Model\r\nThe General Aggression Model (GAM: Anderson & Bushman 2002;\r\nDeWall, Anderson & Bushman, in press) provides a theoretically sound\r\nand helpful way of understanding how exposure to violent media can\r\nincrease a person\u2019s likelihood of being aggressive in both the short and\r\nlong term (see Figures 4 and 5).\r\nThe GAM is a model of what is happening psychologically during an\r\nepisode of aggression. In essence the person brings their own readiness\r\nto aggress, through their gender, beliefs and attitudes about aggres-\r\nsion, personality and other stable factors. Each situation has cues and\r\ntriggers for aggression, such as the presence of a weapon or an insult.\r\nWhen a person encounters an aggression-triggering situation, various\r\nrelevant cognitions (memories, beliefs, attitudes, scripts for behaviour)\r\nare activated, along with feelings (such as fear and anger) and a level\r\nof physiological arousal. Higher levels of arousal make a dominant\r\ntendency to act more likely.\r\nFigure 4: The General Aggression Model\r\n75\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\nAs a result of these activated cognitions and feelings, and of the\r\nlevel of arousal, the person has an immediate response. If they are very\r\naroused or if the situation requires immediate action, this will probably\r\nbe the ultimate response. If the person has the time and cognitive capac-\r\nity for a more considered response they will evaluate their options and are more likely to make a thought-through response. Either way, the\r\neventual response, which may be aggressive, is enacted, elicits a social\r\nresponse and the episode is encoded into memory. Once in memory,\r\nit becomes part of the \u201cperson\u201d and can then affect their responses to\r\nfuture situations.\r\nAlthough \u201cperson\u201d characteristics are very important in deter-\r\nmining how an individual reacts in a specific situation, the research\r\npresented in this chapter reveals that most people, regardless of personal\r\ncharacteristics, are influenced by violent video games. It also reveals\r\nthat violent video games provide many cues for aggressive behaviour,\r\nactivate aggressive cognitions and feelings, and can increase levels of\r\narousal. These internal processes can explain why there is also a robust\r\nlink between violent video game playing and aggressive behaviour.\r\nOver the long term, exposure to the attitudes, ideas and scripts for\r\nbehaviour in violent video games leads to stable knowledge structures,\r\nattitudes, biases in thinking, scripts for conflict resolution and action\r\ntendencies that include aggressive behaviour (see Figure 5). In turn,\r\nthese increase the base level of aggressiveness in that person\u2019s personal-\r\nity and bring the person to an aggression-triggering type of situation\r\nwith a higher predisposition to aggress.\r\nBetween the two models, it is easy to see how playing a video game\r\ncan lead to aggression in the short term, and how repeated playing can\r\nlead to higher levels of aggression in the long term.\r\nConclusions and advice for parents and professionals\r\nworking with children\r\nIn this chapter we have detailed the evidence that video games can\r\nbe used for a wide array of helpful purposes, but that there can be\r\nmany negative consequences for playing violent games, especially when\r\nplayed excessively. This raises an important question: \u201cHow do we help\r\nchildren to benefit from video games but escape their negative impacts?\u201d\r\nIn Chapter 1 it was noted that the \u201cyou are what you eat\u201d principle\r\napplies to the way media exposure affects the way the human neural\r\nnetwork \u201cwires up\u201d as well as to food consumption. Using the food\r\nmetaphor can be helpful for parents and professionals when it comes\r\nto advising children on how to use media in a beneficial way. Through\r\n77\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\nschool education many children are interested in healthy eating and\r\nthis can be extended to maintaining a healthy media diet. For example,\r\nchildren could be told that, as with food, there are media that are good\r\nto consume regularly (in moderation), media that are for infrequent\r\nconsumption and media that children should avoid. Helping a child\r\nto self-regulate what they watch and hear in the media can be very\r\nimportant to a child\u2019s development in this media saturated world. This\r\nmay involve:\r\n\u2022 educating children about media effects generally and about video\r\ngame effects specifically, so that children can learn to make informed\r\nchoices;\r\n\u2022 helping children to limit their time playing video games;\r\n\u2022 encouraging children to play pro-social and educational video\r\ngames in preference to violent games;\r\n\u2022 keeping video game consoles in public areas and out of children\u2019s\r\nbedrooms; and\r\n\u2022 playing video games with your children so that you are aware of\r\ntheir content and can knowledgeably discuss the implications of\r\nplaying certain types of games and screen out potentially harmful\r\nones.\r\nIt is desirable for children to be able use video games for a range of\r\neducational and developmental objectives, but to have less exposure\r\nto the more harmful impacts. We hope that this chapter has helped to\r\ndispel some popular myths about the impact of violent video games\r\non children and adolescents and has clarified for readers how positive\r\noutcomes might be achieved. A Tragic Postscript\r\nI see MW2 more as a part of my training-simulation than anything else \u2026\r\nYou can more or less completely simulate actual operations\r\nThese were the chilling words with which Anders Behring Breivik\r\nreferred to the computer game Modern Warfare 2 in a 1500-page mani-\r\nfesto disseminated just hours before he was responsible for the deaths\r\nof 76 of his fellow Norwegians (Moses, 2011; Shah, 2011; Townsend &\r\nTisdall, 2011). The 32-year-old male behind the now infamous bombing\r\n78\r\ngrowing up fAsT And furious\r\nof government buildings in Oslo and subsequent shooting massacre on\r\nUtoya island on 22 July 2011 made no secret of the fact that playing the\r\nviolent video games Modern Warfare 2 and World of Warcraft aided\r\nhim in preparing and executing his attacks. Breivik identified Modern\r\nWarfare 2 as helping him with \u201ctarget practice\u201d (Shah, 2011) and\r\ninvolvement with World of Warcraft as providing sufficient cover for\r\nhis preparatory activities (Moses, 2011). As a result of the attacks, one\r\nof Norway\u2019s biggest retailers, Coop Norway, issued a ban of indefinite\r\nduration on these and other violent video games that, at the time of\r\npublication, has yet to be lifted (Narcisse, 2011; Navarro, 2011). When\r\nconsidering the impact of violent video games, particularly in light of\r\nthe Norway atrocities, it should also be noted that video games in which\r\nacts of violence are executed in first-person, immersive environments\r\nhave long been recognised and used by the US military forces as effec-\r\ntive in both the training and recruitment of their members (Holguin,\r\n2009; Robson, 2008).", "full_prompt": "When asked a question, you should only use the information within the provided context to form your answer. If you can't answer a question using the given context, reply with \"I don't have that information, did you have any other questions?\". Limit your answers to 200 words or less.\n\nParents often ask about the effects of violent video games on their\r\nchildren and teenagers. In most cases, they note that their \u201ccommon\r\nsense\u201d instinct is that too much exposure to violent video games must\r\nhave some sort of negative effect on their children, but that they have\r\nread in the media that \u201cthe jury is still out\u201d on violent media effects or\r\nthat there is no convincing evidence that violent video game playing is\r\nharmful. Confusion around this conflict will often prompt them then to\r\nask: \u201cwhat does the scientific evidence really say?\u201d In this chapter we\r\nshow that the common sense view is backed up by a substantial body\r\nof recent scientific findings. Helpful and pro-social video game content\r\nhas great potential for enhancing the lives of children and adolescents,\r\nbut exposure to anti-social and violent video game content increases\r\nthe likelihood of a range of negative outcomes, with greater exposure\r\nincreasing the risk.\r\nVideo games have been around for nearly 50 years. Kirsch (2010)\r\nnotes the first as being Spacewar (released in 1962), a game in which two\r\nspaceships battle to the death in space. Although the graphics were very\r\nsimple compared to modern games, the theme of battling to the death\r\nis one that has endured through the ensuing five decades.\r\nAccording to the most recent comprehensive poll by the Kaiser\r\nFoundation, American children aged 8\u201318 play an average of eight\r\nhours of video games per week, an increase of over 400 per cent from\r\n1999 (Rideout, Foehr & Roberts, 2010). Playing is heaviest in the 11\u201314\r\nage group, with boys outplaying girls more than 2.5 hours to 1. A recent\r\nstudy suggests that around 99 per cent of American boys play video\r\ngames, along with 94 per cent of girls (Lenhart et al, 2008). It is common\r\nfor US children and adolescents to play more than 20 hours per week\r\n56Chapter in W. Warburton & D. Braunstein (Eds.) Growing Up Fast and\r\nFurious: Reviewing the Impacts of Violent and Sexualised Media on\r\nChildren, (pp. 56-84). Annandale, NSW, Australia: The Federation Press.\r\nand it is not uncommon for males to play 40 hours or more per week\r\n(Bailey, West & Anderson, 2010). On average, Australian 7\u201318-year-olds\r\nplayed somewhat less than their US counterparts in 2007 (4.7 hours per\r\nweek: see ACMA, 2007), but this figure could have risen substantially\r\nin recent years if Australian children have followed the steep upward\r\ntrend found in the latest US studies.\r\nThe types of games vary, but content analyses by Dill and colleagues\r\n(2005) show that the majority of top selling video games and children\u2019s\r\nfavourite games contain violence, and often strong violence. More\r\nrecently, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 grossed ~$USD 550 million in\r\nthe first five days of its 2009 release, at that time more than any other\r\nentertainment product in history (movies included). Next on the list\r\nin 2009 was Grant Theft Auto IV (GTA), with ~$USD 500 million in\r\nfive days. Even more recently (a year is a long time in the video game\r\nworld) Call of Duty: Black Ops grossed $USD 360 million in a single\r\nday, breaking all records (Ortutay, 2010). According to Wikipedia, the\r\nmassive multiplayer online game (MMOG) World of Warcraft has more\r\nthan 12 million online subscribers and thus currently grosses more\r\nthan $USD 180 million per month (at $15 per month per player). GTA,\r\nwhich is rated M17+ in the United States and involves such activities\r\nas going on murderous rampages, having sex with prostitutes and then\r\nmurdering them to retrieve the money paid, has been played by 56 per\r\ncent of United States children aged 8\u201318 (Rideout et al, 2010). Clearly, a\r\nlarge number of children and adolescents are exposed regularly to video\r\ngames with high levels of violence and anti-social themes. This makes\r\nit important for parents, educators and professionals who work with\r\nchildren to have some knowledge of their effects.\r\nBefore turning to the negative effects of violent video games\r\nhowever, it is important to stress that video games can have many\r\nhelpful benefits. Here are just a few.\r\nHelpful effects of video games\r\nPain management\r\nKirsch (2010) notes that various media, including video games, can be\r\nused to distract and relax children during painful medical procedures.\r\n57\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\nCoordination and spatial cognition\r\nA number of studies reveal that video games which require the place-\r\nment of objects within a screen (such as Tetris) can enhance the spatial\r\ncognition abilities of players (that is, the ability to mentally arrange\r\nand rotate objects in three dimensions). Indeed, video game playing\r\nhas been linked with a wide array of visual and spatial skills, primarily\r\nthrough practice effects (see Green & Bavelier, 2006; Okagaki & Frensch,\r\n1994; see also Bailey et al, 2010, for a review). In one study by Gopher,\r\nWeil and Bareket (1994), the flight performance of Israeli Air Force\r\ncadets who had been trained on the Space Fortress II video game was\r\ncompared with the performance of an untrained group. The trained\r\ncadets performed better in almost all aspects of flight performance and\r\nas a result the game was incorporated into the Israeli Air Force training\r\nprogram.\r\nPro-social behaviour\r\nAlthough this area of study is still in its infancy, there is mounting\r\nevidence that video games which model and involve participants in pro-\r\nsocial, helping behaviours can lead to increases in pro-social behaviour\r\nin the short and long term. Most notably, Gentile et al (2009) found that\r\nelementary school students exposed to pro-social video games were\r\nmore helpful than those exposed to violent or non-social video games.\r\nIn a second longitudinal study of Japanese children in grades 5, 8 and 11,\r\nexposure to pro-social video games at the start of the study was linked\r\nwith increased pro-social behaviour some months later, even when the\r\nbaseline pro-social tendencies of children were statistically removed.\r\nIn a final study of Singaporean secondary school students, the amount\r\nof pro-social video game play experienced was correlated with helping\r\nbehaviour, cooperation, sharing and empathy. A study by Greitemeyer\r\nand Osswald (2009) found that pro-social video game playing led to a\r\nshort-term reduction in the tendency to see the world as hostile and an\r\nimmediate reduction in anti-social thoughts.\r\nEducation\r\nA considerable literature reveals video games to be a powerful teaching\r\ntool (eg, Barlett et al, 2009; Murphy et al, 2002; Swing & Anderson,\r\n58\r\ngrowing up fAsT And furious\r\n2008). They have been used to teach algebra (Corbett et al, 2001), biol-\r\nogy (Ybarrondo, 1984), photography (Abrams, 1986), and computer\r\nprogramming (Kahn, 1999), to teach children how to manage diabetes\r\n(Lieberman, 2001; 2006) and to teach specific skills using simulators\r\n(for example, by Qantas pilots, NASA and the Air Force). Gentile and\r\nGentile (2008) describe the educational advantages of using video games\r\nas teaching tools. These include the power of video games to engage\r\nchildren and to \u201cencourage children to persevere in acquiring and\r\nmastering a number of skills, to navigate through complex problems\r\nand changing environments, and to experiment with different identities\r\nuntil success is achieved\u201d (p 127).\r\nExercise\r\nThere has been a recent explosion in the popularity of video games that\r\npromote physical activity and exercise (that is, \u201cExergames\u201d). Games\r\nsuch as Wii Sports Heart Rate; Wii Fit; Wii Play; Wii FitPlus; Dance, Dance\r\nRevolution and Just Dance seem to be part of a recent trend that has seen\r\nan increase in the availability and popularity of non-violent, helpful\r\ngames.\r\nClearly, video games have considerable potential to enhance the\r\nlives of children and adolescents. Unfortunately, excessive video game\r\nplaying, especially of violent video games, has the potential to impact\r\nchildren in a number of negative ways.\r\nHarmful effects of video games\r\nVideo game addiction\r\nIn his moving biography, Unplugged: My Journey into the Dark World of\r\nVideo Game Addiction, Ryan Van Cleave describes the way that a violent\r\nonline game, World of Warcraft, dominated his life to such an extent\r\nthat he was unable to function normally and was driven to the verge of\r\nsuicide. Video game addiction is now taken so seriously by psychologists\r\nand psychiatrists that it was recently considered for inclusion in the fifth\r\nedition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders\r\n(DSM) as a diagnosable psychiatric disorder and has been lodged in its\r\nappendix to encourage further research. It is clear that many children\r\n59\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\nplay video games at a \u201cpathological\u201d level that causes damage to family,\r\nsocial, school or psychological functioning (see Anderson et al, 2012).\r\nFor example, it has been found that 8.5 per cent of 8\u201318-year-old US\r\nvideo game players do so at pathological levels (Gentile, 2009). Similar\r\nstudies have found figures of 11.9 per cent in Europe (Grusser et al,\r\n2007), 8.7 per cent in Singapore (Choo et al, 2010), 10.3 per cent in\r\nChina (Peng & Li, 2009) and 4 per cent for 12\u201318-year-olds in Norway\r\n(Johansson & G\u00f6testam, 2004), with a further 15.5 per cent \u201cat risk\u201d.\r\nAs will be seen in the ensuing sections, the amount that children\r\nplay video games is very important. Those who play excessively are not\r\nonly at risk of a number of negative outcomes, they are also much more\r\nlikely to be playing violent games (see Krah\u00e9 & M\u00f6ller, 2004).\r\nAttention deficits\r\nThere are some studies linking the amount of time children spend play-\r\ning video games to attention deficits, impulsivity and hyperactivity (see\r\nBailey et al, 2010; Swing et al, 2010). For example, Gentile (2009) found\r\nthat adolescents who used video games at pathological levels were\r\nnearly three times more likely to be diagnosed with Attention Deficit\r\nDisorder or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder than adolescents\r\nwho played at non-pathological levels. In a landmark paper, Swing and\r\ncolleagues (2010) examined the effect of video game playing on atten-\r\ntion in elementary school children. They used a longitudinal study that\r\nstatistically controlled for a range of other factors that could also lead to\r\nattention problems and found that amount of time spent playing video\r\ngames predicted increases in teacher assessments of attention deficits\r\nin the children 13 months later. These results suggest that the children\u2019s\r\nlevel of video game playing played a causal role in their subsequent loss\r\nof attentional capacity.\r\nAnderson et al (2012) believe that on theoretical grounds some\r\nvideo games should have less effect on attentional problems (for exam-\r\nple, those that require controlled thought and planning) and that those\r\nwhich require constant reactive behaviours from players (a common\r\nfeature of many violent first person shooting games for example)\r\nmay be more problematic in terms of children developing attentional\r\ndifficulties.\r\n60\r\ngrowing up fAsT And furious\r\nSchool performance\r\nIt is well established that spending longer hours playing video games\r\nis linked with poorer school performance for both children and adoles-\r\ncents (Anderson et al, 2007; Chan & Rabinowitz, 2006; Chiu et al, 2004;\r\nCordes & Miller, 2000; Gentile, 2009; Gentile et al, 2004; Sharif & Sargent,\r\n2006). One explanation for this is a simple displacement of time \u2013 hours\r\nspent playing video games eats into time that would normally be spent\r\nstudying and reading. For example, in a study of 1491 youth between\r\n10 and 19, gamers spent 30 per cent less time reading and 34 per cent\r\nless time doing homework (Cummings & Vandewater, 2007). It is also\r\npossible, however, that children who perform more poorly at school are\r\nalso more likely to \u201cspend more time playing games, where they may\r\nfeel a sense of mastery that eludes them at school\u201d (Anderson et al,\r\n2012). Of course, another possibility is the that excessive gaming creates\r\nattention deficits, which in turn can lead to poorer school performance.\r\nIncreased aggression\r\nShould we be concerned about children and adolescents playing violent\r\nvideo games? Can this lead to aggressive behaviour? Over 98 per cent of\r\npaediatricians in the United States have considered these questions and\r\nbelieve that excessive violent media exposure has a negative effect on\r\nchildhood aggression (Gentile et al, 2004). Similarly, there is a consen-\r\nsus amongst the vast majority of violent video game researchers that\r\ntoo much exposure to violent video games increases the likelihood of\r\naggressive thoughts, feelings and behaviours, leads to desensitisation\r\nto violence and also leads to decreases in pro-social behaviours and\r\nempathy (Anderson et al, 2010; Huesmann, 2010). There are, however,\r\na small number of researchers who dispute this evidence and it seems\r\nthat the views of this small minority have had a large impact on public\r\nperceptions (Anderson & Gentile, 2008; Dill, 2009). In this section of the\r\nchapter we will broadly examine the arguments for this view and then\r\nreview the scientific evidence that does find violent video game effects.\r\nIn this way, we hope that readers can judge the evidence for themselves.\r\n1. The first argument against violent video game effects is that there\r\nis little evidence linking the playing of violent video games to very\r\nviolent behaviours (such as school shootings). To better understand\r\n61\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\nthis argument it is helpful to reflect on the difference between aggres-\r\nsion and violence. In essence, violence is aggressive behaviour that\r\nhas extreme harm as its goal (Anderson & Bushman, 2002). Thus, all\r\nviolence is aggression but not all aggression is violence. With this in\r\nmind we make four points.\r\n(a) Ethically it is not possible to use the most powerful methods \u2013 experi-\r\nmental manipulations \u2013 to test the causal link between violent video\r\ngames and violence because we cannot rightfully incite people to\r\ncause extreme harm in a laboratory. There are, however, ways to\r\ntest links with aggressive behaviour, which can be examined ethi-\r\ncally in a laboratory. It is disingenuous to suggest that because there\r\nare no experimental studies that randomly assign children to years\r\nof playing violent or nonviolent video games and then measure\r\nwhich group commits the most violent crimes, that therefore there\r\nare no established negative or anti-social effects. This is like saying\r\nthat because there are no experimental studies on humans showing\r\nthat cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, smoking is not a causal\r\nrisk factor. The causal links between violent video game playing\r\nand physical aggression are, in our opinion, well established.\r\n(b) Cross-sectional (correlational) studies and longitudinal studies\r\nof violent video game effects have established significant links to\r\nviolent behaviour. Several longitudinal studies in particular\r\nprovide strong evidence that these are causal effects.\r\n(c) Aggressive behaviour, which can include bullying, hurting other\r\npeople physically, hurting other people\u2019s property or relationships\r\nand hurting people verbally, is a very important social phenomenon\r\nin its own right. Aggression does not have to escalate into violence\r\nto be harmful and destructive.\r\n(d) No aggression researchers claim that media violence is the sole or\r\neven the most important source of violent behaviour. The most\r\ncommon approach, and the one taken by the authors, is the \u201crisk\r\nfactor\u201d approach. According to this approach, people can have vari-\r\nous risk factors for aggression or violent behaviour (see Figure 1).\r\nThese might include coming from a violent home, having a violent\r\npeer group, high levels of trait aggression, exposure to violent\r\nmedia and a number of other factors. The more risk factors that are present for a person, especially when they are present from a\r\nyoung age, the more likely that person is to be aggressive or violent.\r\nStrasburger (2009, p 203) notes that:\r\nThe research on media violence and its relationship to real-life\r\naggression is clear: young people learn their attitudes about violence\r\nat a very young age, and once learned, those attitudes are difficult\r\nto change (Anderson et al, 2003; Bushman & Huesmann, 2006).\r\nConservative estimates are that media violence may be causing 10%\r\nof real-life violence \u2013 not the leading cause by any means, but an\r\nunhealthy chunk that we could do something about if we chose to\r\n(Strasburger et al, 2009; Comstock & Strasburger, 1990).\r\nWe believe that Victor Strasburger is right. Many risk factors for\r\naggression and violence are very hard to deal with as parents, as\r\neducators, as professionals and as policy-makers. Media violence,\r\nthough, is one risk factor that can be controlled and about which\r\naction can be taken from the level of the individual home through to\r\nthe level of State and federal governments. This makes the research\r\non media violence effects particularly important.\r\n2. Detractors of the view that playing violent video games increases\r\nthe likelihood of aggressive behaviour also criticise the methodology\r\nof video game studies and of meta-analyses of these studies. It is to this\r\nimportant scientific evidence that we now turn.\r\nFigure 1: Some longitudinal factors for youth violence\r\nAdapted from US Department of Health and Human Services (2001), Bushman and\r\nHuesmann (2006) and Anderson et al (2010).\r\n63\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\nWhat is a meta-analysis and what evidence do the\r\nmeta-analyses provide?\r\nA meta-analysis is a statistical technique whereby scientific studies that\r\ntest the same or a similar hypothesis (for example, that violent video\r\ngame exposure compared to neutral video game exposure will result in\r\nincreased aggression) and the same or a similar outcome (for example,\r\naggressive behaviour) are combined to ascertain the strength (\u201ceffect\r\nsize\u201d) of the average finding. To date there have been a number of meta-\r\nanalyses of the effect of violent video games on aggressive thoughts,\r\nfeelings and behaviours. In particular, studies by Distinguished\r\nProfessor Craig Anderson and Dr Chris Ferguson have received a lot of\r\npublicity in recent years and it is valuable to compare them.\r\nDr Ferguson, a vocal critic of the research demonstrating a link\r\nbetween violent video game playing and aggression, along with video\r\ngame industry representatives, claims that violent video game research\r\nis methodologically flawed and that mainstream media violence\r\nresearchers selectively report biased findings. Dr Ferguson has also\r\nsuggested that Professor Anderson\u2019s meta-analyses have a \u201cpublication\r\nbias\u201d that undermines their results. Dr Ferguson cites his own three\r\nmeta-analyses that examine the question of whether violent video game\r\nplaying increases subsequent aggression. These examined 24, 17 and 14\r\npublished papers, encompassing 25, 21 and 15 separate tests of the same\r\nhypothesis respectively (Ferguson 2007a, 2007b; Ferguson & Kilburn,\r\n2009). In total, 4205 and 3602 participants were tested in the first two\r\nmeta-analyses (the number cannot be determined for the most recent\r\nstudy but is assumed to be lower). Dr Ferguson found a positive relation-\r\nship between violent video game exposure and aggressive behaviour,\r\nwith effect sizes of .29, .14 and .15 respectively. He then inappropriately\r\n(according to some meta-analysis experts, see Bushman, Rothstein, &\r\nAnderson, 2010) \u201ccorrected\u201d for publication bias using a controversial\r\nstatistical procedure called \u201ctrim and fill\u201d that reduced these effect\r\nsizes. Such a procedure guesses what unpublished studies might be out\r\nthere and adds these guesses to the averaging procedure. Based on the\r\n\u201ccorrected\u201d figures, Dr Ferguson concluded there was no effect of violent\r\nvideo games on aggressive behaviour. These three meta-analyses, which\r\nuse highly overlapping subsets of the same small sample of studies, are\r\n64\r\ngrowing up fAsT And furious\r\nwidely cited as the strongest evidence that violent video game playing\r\ndoes not increase the likelihood of aggressive behaviour.\r\nEvidence that playing violent video games does increase the likeli-\r\nhood of aggression comes from many researchers. Professor Anderson\r\nand his colleagues have themselves conducted a large number of such\r\nstudies and have also summarised the available studies in three compre-\r\nhensive meta-analyses, the first in 2001 (Anderson & Bushman, 2001),\r\nthe second in 2004 (Anderson et al, 2004) and the most recent in 2010\r\n(Anderson et al, 2010). The latter paper was co-authored by Professor\r\nHannah Rothstein, an expert in meta-analyses and publication bias.\r\nThis paper detailed major shortcomings in the Ferguson meta-analyses\r\n(which failed to include numerous relevant studies) and included all\r\nrelevant studies then known. Data from 136 articles, 381 separate\r\ntests of hypotheses, and across a massive sample of 130, 296 participants\r\nwere analysed. In this large, all-inclusive meta-analysis, research\r\nmethodology was also examined. Among the many findings was that\r\nstudies with better research methods tended to find stronger effects of\r\nviolent video game playing on aggressive behaviour.\r\nWe present a summary of the findings in Figure 2 (over page). We\r\nunderstand that the concept of effect size is a hard one to grasp without\r\na detailed knowledge of statistical procedures, so we will provide some\r\ncomparison data afterwards to help readers make sense of the results.\r\nThe middle bar shows the effect found, the bars on either side reflect\r\nhow variable the findings were in the studies tested.\r\nFigure 2 shows several meta-analyses. Each tests a different hypoth-\r\nesis. All hypotheses are tested as outcomes of exposure to violent video\r\ngames, and these outcomes include aggressive behaviour, aggressive\r\nthoughts (cognitions), aggressive feelings (affects), physiological arousal,\r\ndesensitisation to violence/low empathy and pro-social behaviour.\r\nAs can be seen, the average effect across these many studies was one\r\nwhereby exposure to violent video games led to an increase in aggressive\r\nbehaviours, aggressive thoughts, aggressive feelings and physiological\r\narousal (which is linked to aggressive behaviour), to desensitisation\r\nto violence and decreased empathy, and to a reduction in pro-social\r\nbehaviours.\r\nIt is important to note that these findings come from a range of\r\nstudy types \u2013 experimental studies in which all participants have exactly the same experience other than the media type they experi-\r\nence, correlational studies of the links between levels of violent video\r\ngame playing and various types of aggressive behaviours in real life,\r\nand longitudinal studies that follow video game playing patterns and\r\nbehavioural patterns in the same people over time.\r\nEach study type makes a unique contribution to what we know.\r\nExperiments can be used to infer that one thing causes another, but it is\r\nharder to generalise these findings to \u201creal life\u201d. Correlational studies\r\ninvolve \u201creal life\u201d behaviours and can test alternative hypotheses, but\r\nit is difficult to determine the causal direction of relationships found\r\n(that is, whether playing violent games causes aggression or whether\r\naggressive people choose violent games). Longitudinal studies are real\r\nworld studies and can be used to find whether one thing causes another\r\nover time in a person\u2019s life. Some media violence studies have followed\r\nthe same people for over 40 years (eg, Huesmann et al, 2003) and have\r\nvery detailed data. Because links between violent video game playing and aggression are found consistently across all three study types, the\r\nevidence converges to suggest both a causal link and an effect that is\r\nfound in the real world.\r\nThe Anderson et al (2010) meta-analysis also found that when\r\nproper statistical methods are used, there was no evidence of systematic\r\npublication bias in the studies. The rather weak evidence of publication\r\nbias produced by Dr Ferguson was likely the result of several factors,\r\nincluding failure to use all of the relevant studies and the combining of\r\ncross-sectional and experimental studies in the publication bias analysis.\r\nTo understand how strong the obtained violent video game effect\r\non aggression is, it can be helpful to get a sense of what the \u201ceffect size\u201d\r\nnumbers actually mean. It is easy to understand that a higher number\r\nmeans a stronger effect, but it is much harder to know how a big a\r\nnumber needs to be before it is considered important. Figure 3 shows\r\nsome effect sizes for well known phenomena that can be used as points\r\nfor comparison.\r\nAs can be seen from Figure 3, violent video game effects are larger\r\nthan the effect of eating calcium on bone mass, of asbestos inhalation\r\nFigure 3: The comparative effect sizes of violent video game\r\neffects and other well known phenomena\r\n* From Best Practices studies, Anderson et al, Psychological Bulletin, 2010.\r\n67\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\non related cancers, of condom use on reducing HIV infection numbers,\r\nof taking aspirin on reducing heart attacks and a range of other very\r\nimportant phenomena. Clearly, the size of violent video game effects is\r\nlarge enough to be considered socially important.\r\nA final finding from the Anderson et al (2010) meta-analyses is that\r\nthe violent video game effects occurred for both males and females,\r\nand across low-violence collectivistic Eastern countries (for example,\r\nJapan) and high-violence individualistic Western countries (for example,\r\nAustralia and the United States). This is not a surprising finding, as other\r\nreviews have found that violent video games affect people regardless\r\nof age, gender, socio-economic status, game genre and game system\r\n(Barlett et al, 2009). In fact, to the knowledge of the authors, no group\r\nhas yet been identified that are immune to the effects of exposure to\r\nviolent media such as video games (see Anderson et al, 2003).\r\nPerhaps the best brief summary of the evidence presented here\r\nis articulated in a statement produced by 13 researchers into violent\r\nvideo game effects (including the authors of this chapter), prepared for\r\nan amicus curiae (friend of the court) brief for the Schwarzenegger and\r\nBrown v Video Software Dealers Association and Entertainment Software\r\nAssociation case in the Supreme Court of the United States (Docket #\r\n08-1448). This statement was supported as being accurate by a further\r\n102 well-respected researchers in this area.\r\nStatement on Video Game Violence\r\nBoth the American Psychological Association (APA, 2005) and the\r\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP, 2009) have issued formal\r\nstatements stating that scientific research on violent video games\r\nclearly shows that such games are causally related to later aggressive\r\nbehavior in children and adolescents. Extensive research has been\r\nconducted over many years using all three major types of research\r\ndesigns (experimental, cross-sectional, and longitudinal). Numerous\r\noriginal empirical research studies have been conducted on children\r\nand adolescents. Overall, the research data conclude that exposure\r\nto violent video games causes an increase in the likelihood of aggres-\r\nsive behavior. The effects are both immediate and long term. Violent\r\nvideo games have measurable and statistically significant effects on\r\nboth males and females. Theoretically important effects of violent\r\nvideo games have been confirmed by many empirical studies. The\r\neffects have been replicated by researchers in different settings and\r\nin numerous countries. The psychological processes underlying\r\n68\r\ngrowing up fAsT And furious\r\nsuch effects are well understood and include: imitation, observa-\r\ntional learning, priming of cognitive, emotional and behavioral\r\nscripts, physiological arousal, and emotional desensitization. These\r\nare general processes that underlie all types of social behavior, not\r\njust aggression and violence; they have been confirmed by count-\r\nless studies outside of the media violence domain. In addition to\r\ncausing an increase in the likelihood of aggressive behavior, violent\r\nvideo games have also been found to increase aggressive thinking,\r\naggressive feelings, physiological desensitization to violence, and to\r\ndecrease pro-social behavior.\r\nImportantly, this statement alludes to the psychological processes that\r\nare known to underlie the effect of exposure to violent video games\r\non children. These are worth examining in more detail because they\r\nalso provide some insight as to why the effects of violent video games,\r\ncompared to other violent media, may be stronger.\r\nThe psychology of violent video game effects on children\r\nMost of the explanations related to violent video game effects involve\r\ndifferent types of learning. Because of certain features of violent video\r\ngame playing \u2013 interactivity, repetition and the actual playing of the\r\nrole of aggressor \u2013 the effects may be stronger and patterns of behaviour\r\nbetter learned.\r\nImitation\r\nHumans seem to be hard-wired from birth to imitate others. Recently\r\ndiscovered \u201cmirror neurons\u201d in humans and primates represent one\r\nmechanism in the brain that may facilitate this (Caggiano et al, 2009;\r\nGallese et al, 1996; Rizzolati et al, 1996; Umilta et al, 2001). Imitation has\r\nbenefits, including the fast learning of important behaviours, and plays\r\na role in human bonding. However, imitation of unhelpful and anti-social\r\nbehaviours can have clear negative effects for the individual and for\r\nsociety. We know that children will imitate aggressive behaviours,\r\neven if the behaviours are totally new to the child and are not seen to\r\nbe rewarded in any way (Bandura, 1965; 1973; Bandura et al, 1961; 1963a,\r\n1963b).\r\nWe also know that children imitate characters from the media they\r\nsee, with some characters more likely to be imitated than others \u2013 those\r\nthat are attractive, heroic, rewarded for their behaviour or liked, or that\r\nhave high social status. In violent video games the central characters\r\n69\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\noften meet several of these criteria. Does this mean, though, that people\r\nwill copy the behaviours of the characters in very violent games such\r\nas GTA and others? It is possible. For example, an 18-year-old youth\r\nin Thailand stabbed a taxi driver to death trying to \u201cfind out if it was\r\nas easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game\u201d (Reed, 2008). As\r\na result, GTA IV was banned in Thailand. In 2003 William Buckner, 16,\r\nand his step-brother Joshua, 14, killed a man and seriously wounded a\r\nwoman shooting at cars in Tennessee (Calvert, 2003). The boys claimed\r\nthey were acting out the game Grand Theft Auto III. Also in 2003, Devin\r\nMoore, an 18-year-old from Alabama, killed three police officers follow-\r\ning his arrest for a carjacking. On being re-arrested he is reported to\r\nhave told police that \u201cLife is like a video game. Everybody\u2019s got to die\r\nsometime\u201d (Leung, 2005). Again, the killer told police he was copy-\r\ning behaviour he had learned playing GTA III. We are not suggesting\r\nthat violent video game playing alone was causal in these crimes. As\r\nnoted earlier, numerous risk factors influence the likelihood of aggressive\r\nand violent b ehaviour, and the most severe forms of violence virtually\r\nalways require the convergence of many risk factors. Furthermore, it is\r\ndifficult (perhaps impossible) to identify which risk factors were crucial\r\nto any particular aggressive or violent act. Nonetheless, imitation of media\r\nviolence seems to have played some role in these cases.\r\nThere are numerous other stories of aggressive behaviours that\r\nseemingly imitate violent video games. These are easily accessed on\r\nthe internet with a simple search. Clearly, for some violent video game\r\nplayers, simple imitation may play a causal role in some acts of\r\naggression. However there are a number of other factors, also linked with\r\nimitation and learned aggression, that may also be important.\r\nIdentification\r\nAlthough media effects can occur without the person identifying with\r\nany of the characters they have seen, identifying with an aggressor has\r\nbeen shown to increase the likelihood of adopting aggressive behav-\r\niours and attitudes (Cantor, 1994; Huesmann & Eron, 1986; Huesmann\r\net al, 2003). People are more likely to identify with a character who is\r\nperceived as similar, heroic and attractive (Hearold, 1986; Heath et al,\r\n1989), and are more likely to identify with and believe realistic portray-\r\nals because they are easier to relate to personal experiences (Berkowitz\r\n70\r\ngrowing up fAsT And furious\r\n& Alioto, 1973; Feshback, 1972; Geen, 1975). In violent video games, the\r\nplayer strongly identifies with (and usually takes the role of) the aggres-\r\nsor. The aggressive central character is usually glorified and portrayed\r\nas heroic and, in recent years, the portrayal of aggressive characters in\r\nvideo games has become increasingly realistic (Gentile et al, 2007). For\r\nthese reasons, identification with violent/aggressive characters may be\r\na key way that video games impact on children.\r\nRepetition\r\nIt is well established that repetition of behaviours establishes them\r\nin memory, increases skill and automates them as learned responses\r\n(eg, Gentile & Gentile, 2008). Further, repeating an entire behavioural\r\nsequence commits it to memory better than repeating only part of a\r\nsequence (Gentile et al, 2007). Violent video games are much more\r\nrepetitive than other forms of violent media and more often involve\r\nthe repetition of complete behavioural sequences (Gentile et al, 2007).\r\nPlayers repeat the same behaviours and receive similar rewards\r\nthroughout the game, experience similar thoughts and feelings during\r\nthose actions and are exposed to the attitudes espoused in the game\r\nimplicitly and explicitly (for example, sleeping with prostitutes and then\r\nmurdering them to retrieve one\u2019s money in GTA implies misogyny, the\r\nacceptance of violence to get what one wants and that human life has\r\nlittle value). Simply put, the repetitive nature of violent video games is\r\nideal for learning aggressive attitudes and scripts for behaviour.\r\nInteractivity\r\nActive participation assists learning as it requires attention, and closely\r\nattending to a task assists people to memorise the relevant behaviours\r\nand knowledge (Gentile et al, 2007; Gentile & Gentile, 2008). Violent\r\nvideo games are highly interactive, and the recent development of home\r\nconsoles that allow players to use realistic weapons such as replica guns\r\nand swords further increases the level of interactivity and decreases the\r\ngap between game playing behaviours and \u201creal world\u201d behaviours.\r\nThe combination of interactivity and frequent rehearsal is a potent\r\none for learning. In essence, this is a key reason that video games are\r\nsuch powerful tools for teaching pilots, astronauts and soldiers their\r\ncore skills. These factors give video games tremendous potential for\r\n71\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\npro-social pursuits and as learning tools, but have less welcome implica-\r\ntions regarding the interactive rehearsal of anti-social and aggressive\r\nbehaviours.\r\nLack of negative consequences\r\nAnother basic tenet of learning theory, demonstrated across thousands\r\nof studies, is that people are more likely to behave in ways that are\r\nrewarded and less likely to behave in ways that are punished. In terms of\r\nimitation, children imitate aggression they perceive as being rewarded\r\nmore often than aggression they perceive as resulting in punishment.\r\nInterestingly, children will imitate unpunished aggression as often as\r\nrewarded aggression (eg, see Bandura, 1973).\r\nWith these facts in mind, it is relevant that most acts of violence in\r\nvideo games:\r\n(a) go unpunished;\r\n(b) are rewarded (for example, by points, money, status and eleva-\r\ntion to higher game levels);\r\n(c) have unrealistic consequences for the victim.\r\nWith relation to the final point, it is important for parents and profession-\r\nals to note that seeing victims suffer realistic and negative consequences\r\nas a result of media violence should reduce the likelihood of subsequent\r\naggression because pain cues usually inhibit aggressive behaviour\r\n(Baron, 1971a, 1971b, 1979). Also note, however, that in some circum-\r\nstances pain and suffering cues can increase aggressive behaviour (see\r\nBerkowitz, 1993, p 174).\r\nAssociative learning\r\nAs noted in Chapter 1, the brain is a neural network in which concepts,\r\nideas, feelings and memories are stored and interconnected. The way\r\nthis network \u201cwires up\u201d depends on what people experience, with\r\npaired experiences (such as the smell of fresh coffee, pleasure and a\r\ncraving for a hot beverage) becoming more strongly wired together the\r\nmore they are experienced together. This means that people learn to\r\nassociate one thing with another.\r\nIn media generally, and in violent video games especially, many\r\nthings are frequently paired and thus become \u201cwired\u201d together. For\r\n72\r\ngrowing up fAsT And furious\r\nexample, guns are rarely used for any purpose other than violent action.\r\nThis is why there is a well demonstrated \u201cweapons effect\u201d, whereby\r\nthe simple sight of a weapon increases the likelihood of aggression if\r\nthe person has mentally paired a weapon such as a gun with killing or\r\nhurting people rather than with a non-aggressive use such as sports\r\nshooting (Bartholow et al, 2005; Berkowitz & LePage, 1967; Carlson et\r\nal, 1990). This suggests that children who often play video games where\r\nthere is frequent weapon use for the purpose of killing and hurting\r\nothers are more likely to be aggressive immediately after playing the\r\ngame and are more likely to be aggressive when exposed to a weapon\r\nof a similar type in real life.\r\nAssociative learning also explains why whole sequences of behav-\r\niour are learned during video game play and why the acquisition of\r\naggression-related knowledge structures is so important.\r\nAcquisition of aggressive knowledge structures, attitudes and\r\nscripts for behaviour\r\nClearly, violent video games are powerful teachers, but what is the\r\noutcome of such learning for the individual child? In essence, the child\r\n(and adult for that matter) internalises clusters of associated knowledge\r\nabout aggressive behaviour (knowledge structures or \u201cschemas\u201d), as\r\nwell as attitudes about aggressive behaviour and \u201cscripts\u201d for how to\r\nbehave in certain circumstances.\r\nSchemas and scripts contain knowledge about an aspect of living,\r\nmental links to related attitudes, feelings and memories, and a repertoire\r\nof associated behaviours. Scripts additionally contain information about\r\nhow commonly experienced situations \u201cplay out\u201d (such as visiting a\r\nsupermarket) and the typical sequence of behaviours in that situation\r\n(entrance at the left of the store, grab a trolley, milk at the back, bread in\r\nthe second aisle, line up and pay). Schemas and scripts are activated by\r\na trigger (for example, the supermarket logo) and, once active, help to\r\ndirect our behaviour, often without our being aware of it. Children start\r\nto develop schemas about the world as toddlers (and perhaps earlier)\r\nand these can sometimes be aggressive in nature.\r\nIn relation to the development of aggressive knowledge structures\r\nand attitudes, there is considerable evidence that exposure to violent\r\nmedia (including violent video games):\r\n73\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\n(a) increases attitudes approving of aggressive behaviour as a\r\n\u201cnormal\u201d social response (Huesmann, 1998);\r\n(b) increases mental access to scripts for resolving conflict that\r\ninvolve aggressive behaviour and reduces access to conflict-\r\nsolving scripts that are non-aggressive (Bushman & Anderson,\r\n2002; Huesmann, 1998);\r\n(c) underpins the attitude that aggression is (1) exciting and (2)\r\nincreases one\u2019s social status (Groebel, 1998);\r\n(d) increases the belief that the world is a frightening place (Cantor,\r\n2003; Donnerstein et al, 1994);\r\n(e) increases a hostile attributional bias whereby ambiguous but\r\ninnocent behaviours by others are interpreted as deliberately\r\nhurtful (Anderson et al, 2010; M\u00f6ller & Krah\u00e9, 2009); and\r\n(f) increases the likelihood of aggressive behaviour (Anderson et\r\nal, 2010).\r\nRegrettably, children are exposed to a lot of violent media. As noted in\r\nChapter 1, by the age of 18, most US children will have seen many tens\r\nof thousands of murders and acts of violence on television alone. Heavy\r\nplaying of violent video games that involve frequently killing of other\r\npeople or creatures would add greatly to those figures, especially for\r\nmurders. This means that for a lot of children, violent media influences\r\nmay result in higher levels of aggressive schemas, fear about the wider\r\nworld, hostile and anti-social attitudes, and scripts for behaving aggres-\r\nsively, than might otherwise occur without those influences.\r\nFictitious violence versus real violence\r\nRecent brain imaging studies, in which children\u2019s brain activation\r\npatterns are \u201cphotographed\u201d by fMRI machines whilst they are expe-\r\nriencing violent media, have shown that even when children know the\r\nviolence they are watching is fictitious or fantasy violence, their brains\r\nrespond to the violence as if there was a real threat (Murray et al, 2006;\r\nsee also Weber et al, 2006). In addition, long-term memory systems were\r\nactivated, suggesting that this effect could endure beyond the initial\r\nexposure. This research suggests that fantasy media violence seems to\r\nhave a similar impact on children as exposure to realistic media violence. The General Aggression Model\r\nThe General Aggression Model (GAM: Anderson & Bushman 2002;\r\nDeWall, Anderson & Bushman, in press) provides a theoretically sound\r\nand helpful way of understanding how exposure to violent media can\r\nincrease a person\u2019s likelihood of being aggressive in both the short and\r\nlong term (see Figures 4 and 5).\r\nThe GAM is a model of what is happening psychologically during an\r\nepisode of aggression. In essence the person brings their own readiness\r\nto aggress, through their gender, beliefs and attitudes about aggres-\r\nsion, personality and other stable factors. Each situation has cues and\r\ntriggers for aggression, such as the presence of a weapon or an insult.\r\nWhen a person encounters an aggression-triggering situation, various\r\nrelevant cognitions (memories, beliefs, attitudes, scripts for behaviour)\r\nare activated, along with feelings (such as fear and anger) and a level\r\nof physiological arousal. Higher levels of arousal make a dominant\r\ntendency to act more likely.\r\nFigure 4: The General Aggression Model\r\n75\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\nAs a result of these activated cognitions and feelings, and of the\r\nlevel of arousal, the person has an immediate response. If they are very\r\naroused or if the situation requires immediate action, this will probably\r\nbe the ultimate response. If the person has the time and cognitive capac-\r\nity for a more considered response they will evaluate their options and are more likely to make a thought-through response. Either way, the\r\neventual response, which may be aggressive, is enacted, elicits a social\r\nresponse and the episode is encoded into memory. Once in memory,\r\nit becomes part of the \u201cperson\u201d and can then affect their responses to\r\nfuture situations.\r\nAlthough \u201cperson\u201d characteristics are very important in deter-\r\nmining how an individual reacts in a specific situation, the research\r\npresented in this chapter reveals that most people, regardless of personal\r\ncharacteristics, are influenced by violent video games. It also reveals\r\nthat violent video games provide many cues for aggressive behaviour,\r\nactivate aggressive cognitions and feelings, and can increase levels of\r\narousal. These internal processes can explain why there is also a robust\r\nlink between violent video game playing and aggressive behaviour.\r\nOver the long term, exposure to the attitudes, ideas and scripts for\r\nbehaviour in violent video games leads to stable knowledge structures,\r\nattitudes, biases in thinking, scripts for conflict resolution and action\r\ntendencies that include aggressive behaviour (see Figure 5). In turn,\r\nthese increase the base level of aggressiveness in that person\u2019s personal-\r\nity and bring the person to an aggression-triggering type of situation\r\nwith a higher predisposition to aggress.\r\nBetween the two models, it is easy to see how playing a video game\r\ncan lead to aggression in the short term, and how repeated playing can\r\nlead to higher levels of aggression in the long term.\r\nConclusions and advice for parents and professionals\r\nworking with children\r\nIn this chapter we have detailed the evidence that video games can\r\nbe used for a wide array of helpful purposes, but that there can be\r\nmany negative consequences for playing violent games, especially when\r\nplayed excessively. This raises an important question: \u201cHow do we help\r\nchildren to benefit from video games but escape their negative impacts?\u201d\r\nIn Chapter 1 it was noted that the \u201cyou are what you eat\u201d principle\r\napplies to the way media exposure affects the way the human neural\r\nnetwork \u201cwires up\u201d as well as to food consumption. Using the food\r\nmetaphor can be helpful for parents and professionals when it comes\r\nto advising children on how to use media in a beneficial way. Through\r\n77\r\nThe impACT of violenT video gAmes: An overview\r\nschool education many children are interested in healthy eating and\r\nthis can be extended to maintaining a healthy media diet. For example,\r\nchildren could be told that, as with food, there are media that are good\r\nto consume regularly (in moderation), media that are for infrequent\r\nconsumption and media that children should avoid. Helping a child\r\nto self-regulate what they watch and hear in the media can be very\r\nimportant to a child\u2019s development in this media saturated world. This\r\nmay involve:\r\n\u2022 educating children about media effects generally and about video\r\ngame effects specifically, so that children can learn to make informed\r\nchoices;\r\n\u2022 helping children to limit their time playing video games;\r\n\u2022 encouraging children to play pro-social and educational video\r\ngames in preference to violent games;\r\n\u2022 keeping video game consoles in public areas and out of children\u2019s\r\nbedrooms; and\r\n\u2022 playing video games with your children so that you are aware of\r\ntheir content and can knowledgeably discuss the implications of\r\nplaying certain types of games and screen out potentially harmful\r\nones.\r\nIt is desirable for children to be able use video games for a range of\r\neducational and developmental objectives, but to have less exposure\r\nto the more harmful impacts. We hope that this chapter has helped to\r\ndispel some popular myths about the impact of violent video games\r\non children and adolescents and has clarified for readers how positive\r\noutcomes might be achieved. A Tragic Postscript\r\nI see MW2 more as a part of my training-simulation than anything else \u2026\r\nYou can more or less completely simulate actual operations\r\nThese were the chilling words with which Anders Behring Breivik\r\nreferred to the computer game Modern Warfare 2 in a 1500-page mani-\r\nfesto disseminated just hours before he was responsible for the deaths\r\nof 76 of his fellow Norwegians (Moses, 2011; Shah, 2011; Townsend &\r\nTisdall, 2011). The 32-year-old male behind the now infamous bombing\r\n78\r\ngrowing up fAsT And furious\r\nof government buildings in Oslo and subsequent shooting massacre on\r\nUtoya island on 22 July 2011 made no secret of the fact that playing the\r\nviolent video games Modern Warfare 2 and World of Warcraft aided\r\nhim in preparing and executing his attacks. Breivik identified Modern\r\nWarfare 2 as helping him with \u201ctarget practice\u201d (Shah, 2011) and\r\ninvolvement with World of Warcraft as providing sufficient cover for\r\nhis preparatory activities (Moses, 2011). As a result of the attacks, one\r\nof Norway\u2019s biggest retailers, Coop Norway, issued a ban of indefinite\r\nduration on these and other violent video games that, at the time of\r\npublication, has yet to be lifted (Narcisse, 2011; Navarro, 2011). When\r\nconsidering the impact of violent video games, particularly in light of\r\nthe Norway atrocities, it should also be noted that video games in which\r\nacts of violence are executed in first-person, immersive environments\r\nhave long been recognised and used by the US military forces as effec-\r\ntive in both the training and recruitment of their members (Holguin,\r\n2009; Robson, 2008).\n\nI know that violent video games can potentially have negative effects on children, but are there any positive psychological effects associated with video games?"}

Instead of identifying the transaction by an individual bank account through a financial institution, transactions are simply linked to the transaction ID on the blockchain.\n \n\n This type of pseudonymity worries many banks who are concerned about the lack of anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) regulations surrounding digital currency transactions. Oftentimes, banks are under the impression that cryptocurrency transactions can\u2019t be tracked for AML and KYC considerations, which could lead to illegal activity and scams on the network.\n \n\n Volatility\n The price of cryptocurrencies (bitcoin specifically) have generally been volatile over their short life. There are many reasons for this including market size, liquidity, and the number of market participants. Banks see this as a risk because historically, the price hasn\u2019t been stable, so they believe the currency might not remain a stable investment vehicle over time.\n \n\n How Banks Can Get Involved in the Cryptocurrency Industry\n To avoid being left behind, banks need to find a way to embrace this technology and treat it as a friend rather than an enemy. Cryptocurrency adoption could streamline, enhance, and upgrade financial services, and there are plenty of recent industry advancements that can ease banks\u2019 concerns around the risks and instead let them recognize the potential benefits.\n \n\n Custody Services\n In July, the OCC stated that banks and savings associations could provide crypto custody services for customers, including holding unique cryptographic keys associated with accessing private wallets. This means that the OCC believes that banks could safely and effectively hold either the cryptocurrency itself, or the key to access crypto on a personal digital wallet for its customers.\n \n\n Easy Onboarding & Expert Assistance\n Banks could help bring new, less experienced individual investors into the space by developing tools that would facilitate the adoption of crypto by their customers. For example, inexperienced cryptocurrency investors may not have the capabilities to set up their own wallet to custody their own cryptocurrency. Rather than leaving their cryptocurrency \u201coff exchange\u201d or at an unregulated third party, they may find it easier and more secure to hold it within a trusted financial institution.\n \n\n Banks could offer interest-bearing crypto accounts, where customers could invest the crypto on the back end or through other financial tools. Banks might relieve some of the stress of investors that aren\u2019t experts in the nuances of crypto by acting as a trusted third party that\u2019s well-respected in the finance industry and can keep investors\u2019 assets protected.\n \n\n AML/KYC Regulations Administered\n In 2019, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network\u2019s (FinCEN) determined that any cryptocurrency transactions and custody services conducted through crypto entities that are considered money service businesses must still abide by AML/KYC regulations. This will help avoid malicious transactions, illegal activity, or scams using these platforms. These regulations could help banks and larger financial institutions conduct due diligence on customers involved in crypto transactions, further diminishing their anxieties about the risks that these transactions pose.\n \n\n There\u2019s even a possibility that blockchain technology could automate AML and KYC verifications. Blockchain could potentially allow for a streamlined view of shared data on individuals between banks, loan officers, and other institutions. In other words, there could eventually be one blockchain that stores all customer data. This blockchain data could then be utilized by all financial institutions, allowing for fast reviews of customers to quickly identify any red flags insinuating nefarious or illegal activity.\n \n\n Security Concerns\n Banks can help mitigate the security concerns of cryptocurrency holders. Hacking of personal wallets and exchanges is a concern for many holders. Well-established banks could help secure digital currencies from theft or hacks, putting clients\u2019 minds at ease. Bringing cryptocurrency under bank supervision could help diminish criminal activity or the appearance to outsiders that cryptocurrency transactions aren\u2019t secure.\n \n\n Payments\n As indicated in the most recent OCC letter, banks can utilize public blockchains, including stablecoins, to speed up their payment processes. Blockchain technology provides a faster and less expensive alternative to clearing houses when processing transactions. The clearing and settlements could occur at a much faster rate if banks utilized blockchain technology.\n \n\n Smart Contracts\n When entering into an agreement through a smart contract, there\u2019s a reduced level of trust needed among parties because the success of the transaction relies on computer code instead of an individual\u2019s behavior. Banks could reinforce that trust by becoming a reliable third party that utilizes these smart contracts for mortgages, commercial loans, letters of credit, or other transactions.\n \n\n Guidance and regulation surrounding digital assets is sparse, leaving many financial institutions wary of adoption. Concerns surrounding the security and stability of cryptocurrency also hold banks back from entering this space\u2014but instead of fearing the risks of this technology, banks should be looking ahead to its potential benefits.\n \n\n Financial institutions should also shift from thinking of crypto as a competitor to that of a partner. Banks can actually play a significant role in the crypto industry, adding some much needed assurance and security to the largely unregulated environment.

Hacking of personal wallets and exchanges is a concern for many holders. Well-established banks could help secure digital currencies from theft or hacks, putting clients\u2019 minds at ease. Bringing cryptocurrency under bank supervision could help diminish criminal activity or the appearance to outsiders that cryptocurrency transactions aren\u2019t secure.\n \n\n Payments\n As indicated in the most recent OCC letter, banks can utilize public blockchains, including stablecoins, to speed up their payment processes. Blockchain technology provides a faster and less expensive alternative to clearing houses when processing transactions. The clearing and settlements could occur at a much faster rate if banks utilized blockchain technology.\n \n\n Smart Contracts\n When entering into an agreement through a smart contract, there\u2019s a reduced level of trust needed among parties because the success of the transaction relies on computer code instead of an individual\u2019s behavior. Banks could reinforce that trust by becoming a reliable third party that utilizes these smart contracts for mortgages, commercial loans, letters of credit, or other transactions.\n \n\n Guidance and regulation surrounding digital assets is sparse, leaving many financial institutions wary of adoption. Concerns surrounding the security and stability of cryptocurrency also hold banks back from entering this space\u2014but instead of fearing the risks of this technology, banks should be looking ahead to its potential benefits.\n \n\n Financial institutions should also shift from thinking of crypto as a competitor to that of a partner. Banks can actually play a significant role in the crypto industry, adding some much needed assurance and security to the largely unregulated environment. Adopting cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology overall can streamline processes and take banking into the next generation of efficiency and innovation.\n https://www.wolfandco.com/resources/insights/how-cryptocurrencies-may-impact-the-banking-industry/"}

Use complete sentences.", "user_request": "Summarize the possible uses, that are addressed in the provided document, of Google Gemini.", "context_document": "**What is Google Gemini (formerly Bard)?**\nGoogle Gemini -- formerly called Bard -- is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot tool designed by Google to simulate human conversations using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. In addition to supplementing Google Search, Gemini can be integrated into websites, messaging platforms or applications to provide realistic, natural language responses to user questions.\n\nList of tasks Google Gemini can perform.\nGoogle Gemini can be applied pragmatically to complete various tasks.\nGoogle Gemini is a family of multimodal AI large language models (LLMs) that have capabilities in language, audio, code and video understanding.\n\nGemini 1.0 was announced on Dec. 6, 2023, and built by Alphabet's Google DeepMind business unit, which is focused on advanced AI research and development. Google co-founder Sergey Brin is credited with helping to develop the Gemini LLMs, alongside other Google staff.\n\nAt its release, Gemini was the most advanced set of LLMs at Google, powering Bard before Bard's renaming and superseding the company's Pathways Language Model (Palm 2). As was the case with Palm 2, Gemini was integrated into multiple Google technologies to provide generative AI capabilities.\n\nGemini integrates NLP capabilities, which provide the ability to understand and process language. Gemini is also used to comprehend input queries as well as data. It's able to understand and recognize images, enabling it to parse complex visuals, such as charts and figures, without the need for external optical character recognition (OCR). It also has broad multilingual capabilities for translation tasks and functionality across different languages.\n\nHow does Google Gemini work?\nGoogle Gemini works by first being trained on a massive corpus of data. After training, the model uses several neural network techniques to be able to understand content, answer questions, generate text and produce outputs.\n\nSpecifically, the Gemini LLMs use a transformer model-based neural network architecture. The Gemini architecture has been enhanced to process lengthy contextual sequences across different data types, including text, audio and video. Google DeepMind makes use of efficient attention mechanisms in the transformer decoder to help the models process long contexts, spanning different modalities.\n\nGemini models have been trained on diverse multimodal and multilingual data sets of text, images, audio and video with Google DeepMind using advanced data filtering to optimize training. As different Gemini models are deployed in support of specific Google services, there's a process of targeted fine-tuning that can be used to further optimize a model for a use case. During both the training and inference phases, Gemini benefits from the use of Google's latest tensor processing unit chips, TPU v5, which are optimized custom AI accelerators designed to efficiently train and deploy large models.\n\nA key challenge for LLMs is the risk of bias and potentially toxic content. According to Google, Gemini underwent extensive safety testing and mitigation around risks such as bias and toxicity to help provide a degree of LLM safety. To help further ensure Gemini works as it should, the models were tested against academic benchmarks spanning language, image, audio, video and code domains. Google has assured the public it adheres to a list of AI principles.\n\nAt launch on Dec. 6, 2023, Gemini was announced to be made up of a series of different model sizes, each designed for a specific set of use cases and deployment environments. The Ultra model is the top end and is designed for highly complex tasks. The Pro model is designed for performance and deployment at scale. As of Dec. 13, 2023, Google enabled access to Gemini Pro in Google Cloud Vertex AI and Google AI Studio. For code, a version of Gemini Pro is being used to power the Google AlphaCode 2 generative AI coding technology.\n\nThe Nano model is targeted at on-device use cases. There are two different versions of Gemini Nano: Nano-1 is a 1.8 billion-parameter model, while Nano-2 is a 3.25 billion-parameter model. Among the places where Nano is being embedded is the Google Pixel 8 Pro smartphone.\n\nWhen was Google Bard first released?\nGoogle initially announced Bard, its AI-powered chatbot, on Feb. 6, 2023, with a vague release date. It opened access to Bard on March 21, 2023, inviting users to join a waitlist. On May 10, 2023, Google removed the waitlist and made Bard available in more than 180 countries and territories. Almost precisely a year after its initial announcement, Bard was renamed Gemini.\n\nMany believed that Google felt the pressure of ChatGPT's success and positive press, leading the company to rush Bard out before it was ready. For example, during a live demo by Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, it responded to a query with a wrong answer.\n\nIn the demo, a user asked Bard the question: \"What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my 9-year-old about?\" In Bard's response, it mentioned that the telescope \"took the very first pictures of a planet outside of our own solar system.\" Astronomers quickly took to social media to point out that the first image of an exoplanet was taken by an earthbound observatory in 2004, making Bard's answer incorrect. The next day, Google lost $100 billion in market value -- a decline attributed to the embarrassing mistake.\n\nWhy did Google rename Bard to Gemini and when did it happen?\nBard was renamed Gemini on Feb. 8, 2024. Gemini was already the LLM powering Bard. Rebranding the platform as Gemini some believe might have been done to draw attention away from the Bard moniker and the criticism the chatbot faced when it was first released. It also simplified Google's AI effort and focused on the success of the Gemini LLM.\n\nThe name change also made sense from a marketing perspective, as Google aims to expand its AI services. It's a way for Google to increase awareness of its advanced LLM offering as AI democratization and advancements show no signs of slowing.\n\nWho can use Google Gemini?\nGemini is widely available around the world. Gemini Pro is available in more than 230 countries and territories, while Gemini Advanced is available in more than 150 countries at the time of this writing. However, there are age limits in place to comply with laws and regulations that exist to govern AI.\n\nUsers must be at least 18 years old and have a personal Google account. However, age restrictions vary for the Gemini web app. Users in Europe must be 18 or older. In other countries where the platform is available, the minimum age is 13 unless otherwise specified by local laws. Also, users younger than 18 can only use the Gemini web app in English.\n\nIs Gemini free to use?\nWhen Bard became available, Google gave no indication that it would charge for use. Google has no history of charging customers for services, excluding enterprise-level usage of Google Cloud. The assumption was that the chatbot would be integrated into Google's basic search engine, and therefore be free to use.\n\nAfter rebranding Bard to Gemini on Feb. 8, 2024, Google introduced a paid tier in addition to the free web application. Pro and Nano currently are free to use via registration. However, users can only get access to Ultra through the Gemini Advanced option for $20 per month. Users sign up for Gemini Advanced through a Google One AI Premium subscription, which also includes Google Workspace features and 2 terabytes of storage.\n\nWhat can you use Gemini for?

", "user_request": "Discuss the concept of military necessity as outlined in this article and its relationship to contemporary asymmetric conflict.", "context_document": "Abstract Inequality in arms, indeed, significant disparity between belligerents, has become a prominent feature of various contemporary armed conflicts. Such asymmetries, albeit not at all a new phenomenon in the field of warfare, no longer constitute a random occurrence of singular battles. As a structural characteristic of modern-day warfare asymmetric conflict structures have repercussions on the application of fundamental principles of international humanitarian law. How, for example, can the concept of military necessity, commonly understood to justify the degree of force necessary to secure military defeat of the enemy, be reconciled with a constellation in which one side in the conflict is from the outset bereft of any chance of winning the conflict militarily? Moreover, military imbalances of this scope evidently carry incentives for the inferior party to level out its inferiority by circumventing accepted rules of warfare. This article attempts tentatively to assess the repercussions this could have on the principle of reciprocity, especially the risk of the instigation of a destabilizing dynamic of negative reciprocity which ultimately could lead to a gradual intensification of a mutual disregard of international humanitarian law.\r\nIntroduction \r\nWith only one remaining superpower and more generally the considerable and predictably widening technological divide, an imbalance in the military capacity of warring parties has become a characteristic feature of contemporary armed conflicts. Coupled with a growing involvement of non-state entities, the disparity between belligerents is steadily increasing, and various contemporary armed conflicts appear to be more and more asymmetric in structure. Unlike the geostrategic set-up that prevailed throughout the cold war period, it is a widely perceived paradox of today\u2019s strategic environment that military superiority may actually accentuate the threat of nuclear, biological, chemical and, generally speaking, perfidious attack. Indeed, direct attacks against civilians, hostage-taking and the use of human shields \u2013 practices that have long been outlawed in armed conflicts\u2013 have seen a revival in recent conflicts in which the far weaker party has often sought to gain a comparative advantage over the militarily superior enemy by resorting to such practices as a matter of strategy. International terrorism, although not necessarily conducted within the context of an armed conflict triggering the application of international humanitarian law (IHL), is often regarded as the epitome of such asymmetry. At the same time militarily superior parties at the other end of the spectrum have had recourse to indiscriminate attacks, illegal interrogation practices and renditions, as well as legally dubious practices such as targeted killings or hardly reviewable covert operations, in order to strike at their frequently amorphous enemy. Significant inequality of arms, that is a disparate distribution of military strength and technological capability in a given conflict, seemingly creates incentives for adversaries to resort to means and methods of warfare that undermine and are sometimes an outright violation of long-accepted standards of international humanitarian law. The war between the US-led Coalition and Iraq or the war in Afghanistan are clear examples. This tendency is reinforced if belligerents differ in nature, as in the recent conflict between Israel and Hezbollah (\u2018\u2018party of God\u2019\u2019)\u2013 the Lebanon-based Shia Islamic militia and political organization\u2013 or if factual asymmetries are combined with a legal asymmetry, that is in a constellation in which one side is accorded little or no legal standing. To be sure, perfect symmetries have rarely been present in war. However, the patterns of non-compliance displayed in various contemporary conflicts seem to be more structured and systematic than ever before. The present study first seeks to verify this assumption. It considers whether factual and potentially legal asymmetries do indeed constitute an incentive for breaches of international humanitarian law provisions, and, if so, how patterns of contemporary conflicts differ from those of previous conflicts that likewise exhibited discernible asymmetries. In a second step, closer scrutiny is given to the actual patterns of non-compliance in asymmetric scenarios, particularly in the light of the interplay of the principle of distinction and the principle of proportionality.\r\nNeither the term \u2018\u2018asymmetric warfare\u2019\u2019 nor the sometimes synonymously employed terms \u2018\u2018fourth-generation warfare\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018non-linear war\u2019\u2019 have thus far been concordantly defined.3 It is not the intention of this study to venture into this perhaps impenetrable terrain. Analysis shows, however, that there is a noticeable tendency in contemporary conflicts towards an increasing inequality between belligerents in terms of weaponry. While this is a long-known phenomenon in non-international armed conflicts, evaluation of the effects of military disparity in international armed conflicts continues, as does the debate over the extent to which transnational conflicts involving states and non-state entities should be subject to the laws of war. In attempting to approach this debate from a somewhat different angle, it is the overall purpose of this study to gauge the long-term repercussions that asymmetric conflict structures may have on the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law and thereby tentatively to assess the degree of asymmetry\u2013 that is, the level of military disparity between belligerents\u2013 that can still be reconciled with the legal regime applicable in times of war.5 To this end the study, in a third step, weighs the traditional concept of military necessity as laid down in the Lieber Code of 1863 against the promulgated necessities in asymmetric conflicts of our time. Even though the fundamental concepts and principles of the laws of war have been designed as prophylactic mechanisms flexible enough to outlast changes in the way in which wars are waged, it is here contended that the concept of military necessity and the principle of distinction presuppose a minimum degree of symmetry and therefore cannot be applied in subordinative constellations akin to human rights patterns, as are commonly seen in the fight against international terrorism.\r\nThe vantage point for the fourth and final part of the analysis is the principle of reciprocity. As the military mismatch between conflicting parties in numerous modern armed conflicts becomes more marked, the balancing influence of the reciprocity entailed by the traditional concept of symmetric warfare is gradually being undermined.6 While the deterrent effects of an increasingly effective system of international criminal law and of media coverage and public opinion\u2013 although the last two are ambivalent factors that could also be used for the opposite purpose\u2013 could arguably help to contain non-compliant behaviour in war, international humanitarian law might thus be simultaneously bereft of its own inherent regulating mechanisms which have traditionally taken effect in the combat zone itself. The destabilizing dynamic of reciprocity could lead to a gradual and perhaps insidious erosion of the protective scope of core principles of international humanitarian law. Repeated violations of, for example, the principle of distinction by one party to a conflict are likely to induce the other side to expand its perception of what is militarily necessary, and hence proportional, when engaging in battle against such an enemy. In the final stage, and admittedly only as a worst-case scenario, an intentional and deceitful deviation from accepted standards regulating the conduct of hostilities carries the considerable risk of starting a vicious circle of ever greater negative reciprocity, in which the expectations of the warring parties are transformed into an escalating mutual noncompliance with international humanitarian law.\r\nA heightened risk of structural non-compliance? \r\nHistorically, the majority of laws on international armed conflict have been designed on the basis of Clausewitz\u2019s arguably rather Eurocentric conception of war, that is, the assumption of symmetric conflicts taking place between state armies of roughly equal military strength or at least comparable organizational structures. Throughout most of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries the dominant powers engaged in sustained arms races either to maintain a peace ensuring symmetry or to establish a tactical asymmetry vis-a `-vis their opponents as a guarantee of military victory in war.7 But quite apart from the biblical story of David and Goliath it is evident that asymmetry in the sense of military disparity is no new phenomenon.8 Nor is it a concept entirely alien to IHL. With the intrinsic disparity of the parties concerned, and even though the threshold criteria of Article 1 of Additional Protocol II to the 1949 Geneva Conventions arguably help to ensure a minimum degree of comparability between those parties, non-international armed conflicts are inherently asymmetric. It was moreover already accepted in the classic concept of symmetric warfare that the structure of conflicts could shift from symmetric to asymmetric, for by the time a conflict drew to its close and one party had gained the upper hand, the initial military balance would be out of kilter. More recently, during the Diplomatic Conference that led to the adoption of Additional Protocol I, states taking part not only acknowledged the persistence of significant disparities in military capacity but accepted that factual disparity between opponents may even lead to differing humanitarian law obligations. For example, with respect to Article 57 of Additional Protocol I on the obligation to take precautions in attack,9 the Indian delegation pointed out that according to the chosen wording the content of the due diligence obligation enshrined therein\u2013 that is, the precise identification of objectives as military or civilian\u2013 largely depended on the technical means of detection available to the belligerents.10 Despite these concerns, the present wording was accepted on the implicit understanding that because of prevailing factual disparities, international humanitarian law obligations may impose differing burdens in practice.11 Schwarzenberger has pointed out that the protective scope of the laws of war has historically been the strongest in duel-type wars between comparable belligerents that were fought for limited purposes, such as the Crimean War of 1853\u20136 or the Franco-German War of 1870\u20131, whereas in major wars such as the Napoleonic wars or the two world wars of the twentieth century\u2013 wars that were fought to the bitter end\u2013 the weaker side often tended to seek short-term advantages by violating the laws of war.12 Indeed, violations of the laws of war have occurred in nearly every case in which IHL has been applicable,13 and the risk that one party may order or connive in large-scale violations of the laws of war in order to gain a tempting advantage or stave off in some way an otherwise threatening defeat has always hovered over the legal regime intended to regulate conduct in armed conflicts.14 However, in symmetric constellations such instances have tended to remain marginal, often limited to the final stages of a war and confined to individual battles in which defeat seemed inevitable, or resort to perfidy or similarly prohibited tactics was perceived as guaranteeing an immediate tactical breakthrough in what was otherwise a military stalemate. As a result of the evident disparate military capabilities of opponents in certain contemporary conflicts, incentives for violations of IHL seem in comparison to have reached a new height. Non-compliance with the provisions of IHL is no longer a random event, confined to temporally and spatially limited incidents within a conflict, but has become a recurrent structural feature that characterizes many of today\u2019s armed conflicts from the outset. The reason is that, faced with an enemy of overwhelming technological superiority, the weaker party ab initio has no chance of winning the war militarily. Figures from the recent war against Iraq illustrate this imbalance of power and capacity quite well. While the Iraqi air force reportedly never left the ground, Coalition forces flew rather more than 20,000 sorties, during which only one fixed-wing aircraft and only seven aircraft in all were lost to hostile fire.15 Evidence of a comparable inequality in the military capability of belligerents will probably become available in the aftermath of the recent conflict in Lebanon. Without anticipating the more detailed analysis below, it should be noted that the Iraqi army\u2019s widespread infringements during the international conflict against the US-led Coalition, as well as Hezbollah\u2019s indiscriminate attacks, stem to a significant extent from the blatant inequality in weaponry. Practices employed by the Iraqi army included recourse to human shields, abuse of the red cross and red crescent emblems, the use of anti-personnel mines and the placing of military objects in protected areas such as mosques and hospitals. Clearly, there is thus an elevated risk that the militarily inferior party, unable to identify any military weaknesses of its superior opponent, may feel compelled systematically to offset the enemy\u2019s superiority by resorting to means and methods of warfare outside the realm of international humanitarian law. \r\nAt the same time the use of \u2018\u2018unthinkable\u2019\u2019 tactics as well as the tactical circumvention of accepted IHL standards creates a barrier that cannot be readily overcome by military superiority alone. Apart from the ongoing hostilities in Iraq, the tactics employed by the Somali tribal leader Farah Aydid in 1993 are a good example of this. In conventional terms, his forces were no match for heavily armed and technologically sophisticated airborne US troops. However, by using primitive weapons and communication systems\u2013 which reportedly varied from cellular phones to tribal drums\u2013 and by resorting to \u2018\u2018unthinkable\u2019\u2019 tactics and to \u2018\u2018barbaric\u2019\u2019 acts perpetrated for the benefit of the news media, the militia convinced the leadership of the United States that despite the military backwardness of the Somali forces the price of involvement in Somalia was very high. In the course of the war against Iraq the use of cluster munitions in populated areas, as well as the alleged use of white phosphorus and the continued recourse by US and British forces to \u2018\u2018decapitation\u2019\u2019 strikes that caused high numbers of civilian casualties, partly constituted indiscriminate attacks and arguably a failure to take \u2018\u2018all feasible precautions\u2019\u2019 as required by IHL. There are thus apparent incentives for both sides to give increasing priority, potentially to the detriment of humanitarian considerations, to the necessities of such a kind of warfare.\r\n Patterns of non-compliance: the interplay between the principle of distinction and the principle of proportionality \r\nRecent conflict patterns suggest that militarily inferior parties, in order to evade attack by an enemy of insurmountable superiority or to level out inequalities in military power, tend in particular to instrumentalize and intentionally manipulate the principle of distinction. This manipulation may occur in different ways.18 Similarly, superior parties are likely to lower the barrier of proportionality in response to a systematic misuse of the principle of distinction and their resulting inability to tackle the enemy effectively. The following description of potential strategies that belligerents may feel compelled to adopt when faced with overwhelming odds or systematic deviations from accepted legal rules is merely intended to facilitate understanding of likely patterns of non-compliance and does not claim to be comprehensive. It is part of the very nature of asymmetric strategies that they are impossible to predict. The principle of distinction As a defensive strategy when facing a technologically superior enemy it is essential, but ever more difficult, to stay out of reach and conceal one\u2019s presence as a combatant. Hiding in mountainous areas, caves, underground facilities and tunnels is one way. However, another means of doing so quickly and efficiently is readily available by virtue of the provisions of IHL themselves. In view of the various forms of protection accorded to civilians, assuming civilian guise is an easy way to evade the enemy and, unlike the more traditional guerrilla-style tactics of hiding underground or in inaccessible areas, it cannot be countered by the development of advanced discovery technologies. Indeed, in order to keep Coalition forces from identifying them as enemies, that is as legitimate targets, many Iraqi soldiers in the recent war reportedly quite often discarded their uniforms. This is not a prohibited tactic, as long as such practices are not used to launch an attack under the cover of protected status; according to Article 4 of the Third Geneva Convention the absence of any fixed distinctive sign recognizable at a distance merely leads to the loss of combatant status and the corresponding privileges. Still, despite its legality such a practice will, if employed as a matter of strategy, create considerable uncertainty about a person\u2019s status and thus subtly erode the effectiveness of the fundamental and, in the words of the International Court of Justice (ICJ), intransgressible principle of distinction. Evidently the notion of distinction, that is, the legally prescribed invulnerability of certain persons and objects, can if manipulated offer manifold loopholes for the evasion of attack.22 The dividing line between legal tactics and illegitimate practices is easily crossed. The misuse of protective emblems for the concealment of military objects is a case in point, and the marking of the Ba\u2019ath Party building in Basra with the ICRC emblem is a flagrant example of such tactics.23 To protect military objects whose nature could not be so readily concealed, weaker warring parties have repeatedly utilized the proportionality barrier: in order to manipulate the adversary\u2019s proportionality equation, immobile military objects are shielded by civilians, while mobile military equipment is intentionally sited close to civilian installations or other specifically protected locations. For example, in the recent conflict in the Middle East Hezbollah hid its rockets and military equipment in civilian neighbourhoods, and UN UnderSecretary-General Jan Egeland\u2019s statement clearly points to the vicious circle that might be triggered by such a practice.24 Similar modes of conduct have been employed with regard to offensive tactics. The reported seizure of ambulance vehicles in order to feign protected status and thus improve the chances of attacking is a typical example, as is the fact that during the battle of Fallujah in November 2004 sixty of the city\u2019s one hundred mosques were reportedly used as bases for military operations.25 It should be noted that, besides violating the principle of distinction, creating the false impression of legal entitlement to immunity from attack and exploiting the enemy\u2019s confidence in that status also amount to perfidy and are prohibited as such.26 Not each and every strategy employed to circumvent superior military power by cunning, surprise, indirect approach or ruthlessness automatically constitutes prohibited conduct; it may, depending on the circumstances, amount to no more than good tactics. However, if unable to identify any military weaknesses of a superior enemy, the weaker opponent may ultimately see no other alternative than to aim for the stronger state\u2019s soft underbelly and attack civilians or civilian objects directly, in outright violation of the principle of distinction. The series of terrorist attacks in the aftermath of 9/11, that is, the attacks in Bali, Mombasa and Djerba in 2002, Riyadh and Casablanca in 2003, Madrid in 2004, London and Cairo in 2005 and Mumbai in 2006\u2013 to mention only those which have received the greatest media attention\u2013 and the constant attacks in Afghanistan and Iraq, shows that this tendency is increasing. Avoiding the risks of attacking well-protected military installations, it enables the weaker opponent to wage an offensive war on the television screens and in the homes of the stronger state and to benefit from the repercussive effects of mass media coverage.27 The principle of proportionality Over time there is a considerable risk that in view of the aforesaid practices, international humanitarian law itself, with its clear-cut categorizations and differentiations between military and civil, may be perceived by a belligerent confronted with repeated violations by its opponent as opening the doors to a kind of war which intentionally does away with such clear demarcations.28 However, the more immediate risk is that the adversary, faced with such a misuse of the principle of distinction, could feel compelled gradually to lower the proportionality barrier. Evidently, if the use of human shields or the concealment of military equipment among civilian facilities occurs only sporadically and at random in an armed conflict, humanitarian concerns are likely to outweigh the necessity to attack using disproportionate force, whereas if such tactics are systematically employed for a strategic purpose, the enemy may feel a compelling and overriding necessity to attack irrespective of the anticipated civilian casualties and damage. Indeed, the explanation given by the Israeli government for the mounting number of civilian casualties in its recent military operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon29 confirms that systematic violation of, for example, the principle of distinction by one side during a conflict is likely adversely to affect the other side\u2019s interpretation and application of the proportionality principle.\r\nMilitary necessity in asymmetric conflicts\r\n Although the concept of military necessity is invoked now and then as a separate justification for violations of the laws of war, today there can be no doubt that in contemporary international humanitarian law the element of military necessity must be balanced against the principle of humanity, and that there is no such elasticity in the laws of war that military necessity can be claimed as a reason to deviate from accepted humanitarian standards. Nevertheless, asymmetric conflict arguably entails a certain risk of the emergence of a modern-day Kriegsrason because obstacles seen as insurmountable could make both sides feel inclined and ultimately compelled vastly to expand their perception of what is necessary to overcome the enemy. Since military necessity is a component of the ius in bello equation of proportionality, to expand or overemphasize the concept of military necessity would impair the protective scope of the proportionality principle.33 The principle of military necessity is closely linked to the objectives of war. However, the objectives sought in asymmetric conflicts vary significantly from those sought in the kind of symmetric conflict constellations which the drafting fathers of the principle of military necessity had in mind. Modern authorities on the laws of war continue to refer to the definition of military necessity laid down in Article 14 of the Lieber Code, according to which \u2018\u2018Military necessity, as understood by modern civilized nations, consists in the necessity of those measures which are indispensable for securing the ends of the war, and which are lawful according to the modern law and usages of war.\u2019\u2019 In view of the formulation \u2018\u2018indispensable for securing the ends of war\u2019\u2019, the principle of military necessity is commonly understood to justify only that degree of force necessary to secure military defeat and the prompt submission of the enemy.37 Indeed, the Declaration of St Petersburg states as early as 1868 that \u2018\u2018the only legitimate object which States should endeavour to accomplish during war is to weaken the military forces of the enemy\u2019\u201938 and the US Army Field Manual stipulates that \u2018\u2018The law of war \u2026 requires that belligerents refrain from employing any kind or degree of violence which is not actually necessary for military purposes\u2019\u2019 and defines military necessity as \u2018\u2018that principle which justifies those measures not forbidden by international law which are indispensable for the complete submission of the enemy as soon as possible\u2019\u2019. Historically, the rather strict alignment of the concept of military necessity with exclusively military objectives, that is, military defeat and the prompt military submission of the enemy, is due to the fact that the concept was originally designed to restrain violence in war. Although sometimes overlooked today, restrictions on violence in war do not merely stem from balancing the principle of military necessity against the principle of humanity.41 The principle of military necessity in and of itself constitutes an important restrictive factor by prescribing that to be legitimate, violence in war first of all has to be militarily necessary.42 A gradual, clandestine widening of this concept, or simply a more lenient understanding of the factors that determine military necessity and hence the notion of military advantage, would therefore undermine the restrictive standards imposed on the use of violence in armed conflicts. Such a process seems particularly likely in view of asymmetric constellations which, owing to their complexity and intangibility, escape any military apprehension stricto sensu. For example, application of the rule of proportionality as laid down in Articles 51 and 57 of Additional Protocol I is significantly affected, even in traditional armed conflicts, by whether the notion of military advantage is understood to mean the advantage anticipated from an attack considered as a whole or merely from isolated or particular parts of the attack.43 In asymmetric constellations that elude both temporal and spatial boundaries\u2013 in other words, the traditional concept of the \u2018\u2018battlefield\u2019\u2019 altogether\u2013 it would seem somewhat difficult to delineate and determine with any degree of precision what is meant by the notion of \u2018\u2018an attack considered as a whole\u2019\u2019.44 More generally, as the asymmetry between belligerents increases, the distinction between political and military objectives and necessities becomes more and more blurred. Especially in conflicts such as those against al Qaeda or Hezbollah, that is, conflicts between a state or group of states and a non-state entity, that entity\u2019s ultimate aim in using military force will be to exert pressure on the politics of the enemy rather than even attempt to achieve the latter\u2019s military submission. Conversely, the superior party is likely to adopt a far more holistic approach, inseparably combining political and military efforts to bring about the entire political eradication or dissolution of the enemy and not just the enemy\u2019s military submission\u2013 especially if it is battling against a non-state entity it categorizes as a terrorist organization.45 To be sure, the separation of military and political aims already present in traditional warfare has always been axiomatic to some extent, given that each and every military operation emanates from both military and political motivations.46 The so-called Christmas bombing of North Vietnam in 1972 is a typical example: even though solely military objectives within the definition thereof were targeted, its purpose was to induce the North Vietnamese government to proceed with political negotiations. Nonetheless, symmetric warfare with its identifiable battlefields in terms of space and duration did allow, at least in theory, a relatively clear separation of military and political necessities and objectives in the actual conduct of warfare. In asymmetric scenarios, however, the weaker adversary is militarily outmatched from the start, military superiority in itself is no longer a reliable guarantee for winning such conflicts and the very notions of \u2018\u2018victory\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018defeat\u2019\u2019 thus become more and more indistinct. If these parameters remain undefined or even indefinable, straightforward determinations of what is militarily necessary are impeded. Military necessities have always been subject to change as warfare has developed, and the concept of military necessity has been flexible enough to adapt accordingly as long as that development largely resulted from technological advances in weaponry. Yet it seems doubtful whether asymmetric constellations akin to law enforcement patterns could still be grasped by and measured against the concept of military necessity,48 for the complexities and intangibility of such scenarios escape its traditionally narrow delimitations. To compromise the concept\u2019s very narrowness, however, would mean compromising long-achieved humanitarian protections that flow directly from the concept itself and could shift the focus of the proportionality equation away from humanitarian considerations and towards military necessities.", "full_prompt": "You can only respond to the prompt using information in the context block. \n\nDiscuss the concept of military necessity as outlined in this article and its relationship to contemporary asymmetric conflict.\n\nAbstract Inequality in arms, indeed, significant disparity between belligerents, has become a prominent feature of various contemporary armed conflicts. Such asymmetries, albeit not at all a new phenomenon in the field of warfare, no longer constitute a random occurrence of singular battles. As a structural characteristic of modern-day warfare asymmetric conflict structures have repercussions on the application of fundamental principles of international humanitarian law. How, for example, can the concept of military necessity, commonly understood to justify the degree of force necessary to secure military defeat of the enemy, be reconciled with a constellation in which one side in the conflict is from the outset bereft of any chance of winning the conflict militarily? Moreover, military imbalances of this scope evidently carry incentives for the inferior party to level out its inferiority by circumventing accepted rules of warfare. This article attempts tentatively to assess the repercussions this could have on the principle of reciprocity, especially the risk of the instigation of a destabilizing dynamic of negative reciprocity which ultimately could lead to a gradual intensification of a mutual disregard of international humanitarian law.\r\nIntroduction \r\nWith only one remaining superpower and more generally the considerable and predictably widening technological divide, an imbalance in the military capacity of warring parties has become a characteristic feature of contemporary armed conflicts. Coupled with a growing involvement of non-state entities, the disparity between belligerents is steadily increasing, and various contemporary armed conflicts appear to be more and more asymmetric in structure. Unlike the geostrategic set-up that prevailed throughout the cold war period, it is a widely perceived paradox of today\u2019s strategic environment that military superiority may actually accentuate the threat of nuclear, biological, chemical and, generally speaking, perfidious attack. Indeed, direct attacks against civilians, hostage-taking and the use of human shields \u2013 practices that have long been outlawed in armed conflicts\u2013 have seen a revival in recent conflicts in which the far weaker party has often sought to gain a comparative advantage over the militarily superior enemy by resorting to such practices as a matter of strategy. International terrorism, although not necessarily conducted within the context of an armed conflict triggering the application of international humanitarian law (IHL), is often regarded as the epitome of such asymmetry. At the same time militarily superior parties at the other end of the spectrum have had recourse to indiscriminate attacks, illegal interrogation practices and renditions, as well as legally dubious practices such as targeted killings or hardly reviewable covert operations, in order to strike at their frequently amorphous enemy. Significant inequality of arms, that is a disparate distribution of military strength and technological capability in a given conflict, seemingly creates incentives for adversaries to resort to means and methods of warfare that undermine and are sometimes an outright violation of long-accepted standards of international humanitarian law. The war between the US-led Coalition and Iraq or the war in Afghanistan are clear examples. This tendency is reinforced if belligerents differ in nature, as in the recent conflict between Israel and Hezbollah (\u2018\u2018party of God\u2019\u2019)\u2013 the Lebanon-based Shia Islamic militia and political organization\u2013 or if factual asymmetries are combined with a legal asymmetry, that is in a constellation in which one side is accorded little or no legal standing. To be sure, perfect symmetries have rarely been present in war. However, the patterns of non-compliance displayed in various contemporary conflicts seem to be more structured and systematic than ever before. The present study first seeks to verify this assumption. It considers whether factual and potentially legal asymmetries do indeed constitute an incentive for breaches of international humanitarian law provisions, and, if so, how patterns of contemporary conflicts differ from those of previous conflicts that likewise exhibited discernible asymmetries. In a second step, closer scrutiny is given to the actual patterns of non-compliance in asymmetric scenarios, particularly in the light of the interplay of the principle of distinction and the principle of proportionality.\r\nNeither the term \u2018\u2018asymmetric warfare\u2019\u2019 nor the sometimes synonymously employed terms \u2018\u2018fourth-generation warfare\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018non-linear war\u2019\u2019 have thus far been concordantly defined.3 It is not the intention of this study to venture into this perhaps impenetrable terrain. Analysis shows, however, that there is a noticeable tendency in contemporary conflicts towards an increasing inequality between belligerents in terms of weaponry. While this is a long-known phenomenon in non-international armed conflicts, evaluation of the effects of military disparity in international armed conflicts continues, as does the debate over the extent to which transnational conflicts involving states and non-state entities should be subject to the laws of war. In attempting to approach this debate from a somewhat different angle, it is the overall purpose of this study to gauge the long-term repercussions that asymmetric conflict structures may have on the fundamental principles of international humanitarian law and thereby tentatively to assess the degree of asymmetry\u2013 that is, the level of military disparity between belligerents\u2013 that can still be reconciled with the legal regime applicable in times of war.5 To this end the study, in a third step, weighs the traditional concept of military necessity as laid down in the Lieber Code of 1863 against the promulgated necessities in asymmetric conflicts of our time. Even though the fundamental concepts and principles of the laws of war have been designed as prophylactic mechanisms flexible enough to outlast changes in the way in which wars are waged, it is here contended that the concept of military necessity and the principle of distinction presuppose a minimum degree of symmetry and therefore cannot be applied in subordinative constellations akin to human rights patterns, as are commonly seen in the fight against international terrorism.\r\nThe vantage point for the fourth and final part of the analysis is the principle of reciprocity. As the military mismatch between conflicting parties in numerous modern armed conflicts becomes more marked, the balancing influence of the reciprocity entailed by the traditional concept of symmetric warfare is gradually being undermined.6 While the deterrent effects of an increasingly effective system of international criminal law and of media coverage and public opinion\u2013 although the last two are ambivalent factors that could also be used for the opposite purpose\u2013 could arguably help to contain non-compliant behaviour in war, international humanitarian law might thus be simultaneously bereft of its own inherent regulating mechanisms which have traditionally taken effect in the combat zone itself. The destabilizing dynamic of reciprocity could lead to a gradual and perhaps insidious erosion of the protective scope of core principles of international humanitarian law. Repeated violations of, for example, the principle of distinction by one party to a conflict are likely to induce the other side to expand its perception of what is militarily necessary, and hence proportional, when engaging in battle against such an enemy. In the final stage, and admittedly only as a worst-case scenario, an intentional and deceitful deviation from accepted standards regulating the conduct of hostilities carries the considerable risk of starting a vicious circle of ever greater negative reciprocity, in which the expectations of the warring parties are transformed into an escalating mutual noncompliance with international humanitarian law.\r\nA heightened risk of structural non-compliance? \r\nHistorically, the majority of laws on international armed conflict have been designed on the basis of Clausewitz\u2019s arguably rather Eurocentric conception of war, that is, the assumption of symmetric conflicts taking place between state armies of roughly equal military strength or at least comparable organizational structures.

The misuse of protective emblems for the concealment of military objects is a case in point, and the marking of the Ba\u2019ath Party building in Basra with the ICRC emblem is a flagrant example of such tactics.23 To protect military objects whose nature could not be so readily concealed, weaker warring parties have repeatedly utilized the proportionality barrier: in order to manipulate the adversary\u2019s proportionality equation, immobile military objects are shielded by civilians, while mobile military equipment is intentionally sited close to civilian installations or other specifically protected locations. For example, in the recent conflict in the Middle East Hezbollah hid its rockets and military equipment in civilian neighbourhoods, and UN UnderSecretary-General Jan Egeland\u2019s statement clearly points to the vicious circle that might be triggered by such a practice.24 Similar modes of conduct have been employed with regard to offensive tactics. The reported seizure of ambulance vehicles in order to feign protected status and thus improve the chances of attacking is a typical example, as is the fact that during the battle of Fallujah in November 2004 sixty of the city\u2019s one hundred mosques were reportedly used as bases for military operations.25 It should be noted that, besides violating the principle of distinction, creating the false impression of legal entitlement to immunity from attack and exploiting the enemy\u2019s confidence in that status also amount to perfidy and are prohibited as such.26 Not each and every strategy employed to circumvent superior military power by cunning, surprise, indirect approach or ruthlessness automatically constitutes prohibited conduct; it may, depending on the circumstances, amount to no more than good tactics. However, if unable to identify any military weaknesses of a superior enemy, the weaker opponent may ultimately see no other alternative than to aim for the stronger state\u2019s soft underbelly and attack civilians or civilian objects directly, in outright violation of the principle of distinction. The series of terrorist attacks in the aftermath of 9/11, that is, the attacks in Bali, Mombasa and Djerba in 2002, Riyadh and Casablanca in 2003, Madrid in 2004, London and Cairo in 2005 and Mumbai in 2006\u2013 to mention only those which have received the greatest media attention\u2013 and the constant attacks in Afghanistan and Iraq, shows that this tendency is increasing. Avoiding the risks of attacking well-protected military installations, it enables the weaker opponent to wage an offensive war on the television screens and in the homes of the stronger state and to benefit from the repercussive effects of mass media coverage.27 The principle of proportionality Over time there is a considerable risk that in view of the aforesaid practices, international humanitarian law itself, with its clear-cut categorizations and differentiations between military and civil, may be perceived by a belligerent confronted with repeated violations by its opponent as opening the doors to a kind of war which intentionally does away with such clear demarcations.28 However, the more immediate risk is that the adversary, faced with such a misuse of the principle of distinction, could feel compelled gradually to lower the proportionality barrier. Evidently, if the use of human shields or the concealment of military equipment among civilian facilities occurs only sporadically and at random in an armed conflict, humanitarian concerns are likely to outweigh the necessity to attack using disproportionate force, whereas if such tactics are systematically employed for a strategic purpose, the enemy may feel a compelling and overriding necessity to attack irrespective of the anticipated civilian casualties and damage. Indeed, the explanation given by the Israeli government for the mounting number of civilian casualties in its recent military operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon29 confirms that systematic violation of, for example, the principle of distinction by one side during a conflict is likely adversely to affect the other side\u2019s interpretation and application of the proportionality principle.\r\nMilitary necessity in asymmetric conflicts\r\n Although the concept of military necessity is invoked now and then as a separate justification for violations of the laws of war, today there can be no doubt that in contemporary international humanitarian law the element of military necessity must be balanced against the principle of humanity, and that there is no such elasticity in the laws of war that military necessity can be claimed as a reason to deviate from accepted humanitarian standards. Nevertheless, asymmetric conflict arguably entails a certain risk of the emergence of a modern-day Kriegsrason because obstacles seen as insurmountable could make both sides feel inclined and ultimately compelled vastly to expand their perception of what is necessary to overcome the enemy. Since military necessity is a component of the ius in bello equation of proportionality, to expand or overemphasize the concept of military necessity would impair the protective scope of the proportionality principle.33 The principle of military necessity is closely linked to the objectives of war. However, the objectives sought in asymmetric conflicts vary significantly from those sought in the kind of symmetric conflict constellations which the drafting fathers of the principle of military necessity had in mind. Modern authorities on the laws of war continue to refer to the definition of military necessity laid down in Article 14 of the Lieber Code, according to which \u2018\u2018Military necessity, as understood by modern civilized nations, consists in the necessity of those measures which are indispensable for securing the ends of the war, and which are lawful according to the modern law and usages of war.\u2019\u2019 In view of the formulation \u2018\u2018indispensable for securing the ends of war\u2019\u2019, the principle of military necessity is commonly understood to justify only that degree of force necessary to secure military defeat and the prompt submission of the enemy.37 Indeed, the Declaration of St Petersburg states as early as 1868 that \u2018\u2018the only legitimate object which States should endeavour to accomplish during war is to weaken the military forces of the enemy\u2019\u201938 and the US Army Field Manual stipulates that \u2018\u2018The law of war \u2026 requires that belligerents refrain from employing any kind or degree of violence which is not actually necessary for military purposes\u2019\u2019 and defines military necessity as \u2018\u2018that principle which justifies those measures not forbidden by international law which are indispensable for the complete submission of the enemy as soon as possible\u2019\u2019. Historically, the rather strict alignment of the concept of military necessity with exclusively military objectives, that is, military defeat and the prompt military submission of the enemy, is due to the fact that the concept was originally designed to restrain violence in war. Although sometimes overlooked today, restrictions on violence in war do not merely stem from balancing the principle of military necessity against the principle of humanity.41 The principle of military necessity in and of itself constitutes an important restrictive factor by prescribing that to be legitimate, violence in war first of all has to be militarily necessary.42 A gradual, clandestine widening of this concept, or simply a more lenient understanding of the factors that determine military necessity and hence the notion of military advantage, would therefore undermine the restrictive standards imposed on the use of violence in armed conflicts. Such a process seems particularly likely in view of asymmetric constellations which, owing to their complexity and intangibility, escape any military apprehension stricto sensu. For example, application of the rule of proportionality as laid down in Articles 51 and 57 of Additional Protocol I is significantly affected, even in traditional armed conflicts, by whether the notion of military advantage is understood to mean the advantage anticipated from an attack considered as a whole or merely from isolated or particular parts of the attack.43 In asymmetric constellations that elude both temporal and spatial boundaries\u2013 in other words, the traditional concept of the \u2018\u2018battlefield\u2019\u2019 altogether\u2013 it would seem somewhat difficult to delineate and determine with any degree of precision what is meant by the notion of \u2018\u2018an attack considered as a whole\u2019\u2019.44 More generally, as the asymmetry between belligerents increases, the distinction between political and military objectives and necessities becomes more and more blurred. Especially in conflicts such as those against al Qaeda or Hezbollah, that is, conflicts between a state or group of states and a non-state entity, that entity\u2019s ultimate aim in using military force will be to exert pressure on the politics of the enemy rather than even attempt to achieve the latter\u2019s military submission. Conversely, the superior party is likely to adopt a far more holistic approach, inseparably combining political and military efforts to bring about the entire political eradication or dissolution of the enemy and not just the enemy\u2019s military submission\u2013 especially if it is battling against a non-state entity it categorizes as a terrorist organization.45 To be sure, the separation of military and political aims already present in traditional warfare has always been axiomatic to some extent, given that each and every military operation emanates from both military and political motivations.46 The so-called Christmas bombing of North Vietnam in 1972 is a typical example: even though solely military objectives within the definition thereof were targeted, its purpose was to induce the North Vietnamese government to proceed with political negotiations. Nonetheless, symmetric warfare with its identifiable battlefields in terms of space and duration did allow, at least in theory, a relatively clear separation of military and political necessities and objectives in the actual conduct of warfare. In asymmetric scenarios, however, the weaker adversary is militarily outmatched from the start, military superiority in itself is no longer a reliable guarantee for winning such conflicts and the very notions of \u2018\u2018victory\u2019\u2019 or \u2018\u2018defeat\u2019\u2019 thus become more and more indistinct. If these parameters remain undefined or even indefinable, straightforward determinations of what is militarily necessary are impeded. Military necessities have always been subject to change as warfare has developed, and the concept of military necessity has been flexible enough to adapt accordingly as long as that development largely resulted from technological advances in weaponry. Yet it seems doubtful whether asymmetric constellations akin to law enforcement patterns could still be grasped by and measured against the concept of military necessity,48 for the complexities and intangibility of such scenarios escape its traditionally narrow delimitations. To compromise the concept\u2019s very narrowness, however, would mean compromising long-achieved humanitarian protections that flow directly from the concept itself and could shift the focus of the proportionality equation away from humanitarian considerations and towards military necessities."}

Seawater electrolysis, as a promising alternative for sustainable hydrogen production, faces challenges due to the expensive and scarce platinum catalyst, as well as the need for additional purification processes to address the complex nature of seawater, resulting in higher production costs (5\u20137). Compared to the widely adopted practice of hydrogen production through electrolysis of alkaline freshwater, the advancement of hydrogen production from seawater has been relatively sluggish (8). The pH of natural seawater is typically around 8.0 and reduced ionic mobility in seawater leads to a diminished pH dependence of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (9, 10), necessitating higher applied voltages to attain the desired efficiency in hydrogen production (11). Furthermore, the complex composition of seawater and the insoluble deposits formed by alkaline earth metal ions such as Ca2+, Mg2+ during electrolysis make seawater HER challenging (1, 12). More fatally, Cl- has a high affinity for the metal active sites of the catalysts as they have strong depassivation and penetrating properties (13, 14), leading to severe degradation of the catalyst and hindering direct seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production (15\u201317). Although certain catalysts demonstrated activity at low current densities but offer low hydrogen production rates (18, 19), far below the high-current hydrogen production conditions required for industrial water electrolysis.\n To address this bottleneck issue, various strategies have been developed, including selective active site engineering (20, 21), three-dimensional structure design (22, 23), and carbon layer protection (24, 25). Recently, Guo et al. (26) proposed an innovative strategy, wherein they enhanced the kinetic processes by generating an in situ localized alkaline environment, achieving excellent seawater catalytic performance at 60\u00b0C. Metal nitrides (MNs) have inherent chemical stability, electrical conductivity, and excellent catalytic activity, and their surfaces undergo in situ transformation to form highly catalytic active hydroxides, while the nitride core remains stable (27, 28). For example, NiMoN@NiFeN prepared by Yu et al. (29) required an overpotential of 160 mV to reach a current density of 500 mA cm-2 and stable operation for 48 hours, which is attributed to the amorphous NiFeOOH layer formed on the nitride surface. Regrettably, the performance of current MN-based electrocatalysts is still suboptimal and it is urgent to manipulate them for efficient seawater splitting.\n In this work, we present a protective strategy by introducing a V2O3 layer by in situ reduction into a catalyst with low loading of Pt and Ni3N. The V2O3 layer acts as an \u201carmor\u201d during electrolysis, markedly reducing the adsorption of Cl- and alkaline earth cations (Ca2+ and Mg2+) from seawater and preventing corrosion of the active sites on the electrode. Benefiting from the powerful protection mechanism, the assembled Pt-Ni3N@V2O3 catalyst exhibits remarkable HER activity in alkalized natural seawater and maintains its performance for at least 500 hours at industrial-grade current density, surpassing the performance of other reported electrocatalysts.\n RESULTS\n Synthesis and characterization\n The hydrothermal method was used to prepare hydroxide precursors in nanoflower-shaped structures, as illustrated in figs. S1 and S2. Subsequently, calcination in NH3 gas was used to obtain a composite of Ni3N and V2O3, resulting in the formation of numerous rough porous structures on the catalyst surface. Pt-Ni3N@V2O3/NF (nickel foam noted as NF) was constructed by placing the Ni3N@V2O3/NF precursor in an aqueous solution of H2PtCl6 at room temperature. On the basis of previous reports, we speculate on the reduction mechanism and route (30\u201332). Specifically, V2O3, as a strong reducing agent, first forms (V2O3)x(OH-)y(s) with H2O molecules (chemical eq. S1), and then Pt4+ ions in solution adsorb onto the surface of the (V2O3)x(OH-)y(s). In situ reduction then occurs with the assistance of H2O molecules to form Pt nanoparticles (chemical eq. S2). Theoretical calculations also confirm that Pt nanoparticles preferentially form on the V2O3 surface rather than the Ni3N surface (fig. S2).\n The powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, as illustrated in Fig. 1A and fig. S3, confirm the presence of a composite phase comprising Ni3N, V2O3, and Pt. These results demonstrate the successful preparation of Pt-Ni3N@V2O3/NF. The hydroxide precursors prepared by the hydrothermal method exhibited nanoflower-like structures with low crystallinity, as shown in figs. S4 and S5. After ammonolysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) show that Ni3N@V2O3/NF exhibit interconnected porous structures (fig. S6) with lattice stripes of 0.203 and 0.183 nm corresponding well to the (111) and (024) facets of Ni3N and V2O3 (fig. S7), respectively. After the incorporation of Pt, SEM and TEM analyses reveal that Pt-Ni3N@V2O3/NF exhibits a granular morphology, together with a rough surface (Fig. 1, B and C). Pt nanoparticles, formed in situ, have an average particle size of 4.41 nm. The high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) shows that amorphous/low crystallinity V2O3 covers the outer surface of Pt-Ni3N@V2O3/NF (Fig. 1D), with lattice stripes of 0.203 and 0.226 nm corresponding to the (111) facets of Ni3N and the (111) facets of Pt (Fig. 1, E to G), respectively. As demonstrated in fig. S8, the particle size of Pt-Ni3N@V2O3/NF increases with longer impregnation time, and this observation is also supported by the electrochemical properties. In Fig. 1 (H and I), high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) images, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) elemental mapping, and EDS line scan collectively suggest that the internal larger nanoparticles comprise Ni3N, while V2O3 is distributed in the surrounding region. In addition, uniformly anchored, small-sized Pt nanoparticles are found on the surface of the structure, forming a dual-active site. The content of Pt is determined by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy to be approximately 6.61% (fig. S9 and table S1), which is consistent with the results of inductively coupled plasma\u2013optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) analysis (6.94%). It is worth noting that the reduction of Pt also occurs on the Ni3N surface in the absence of the V2O3 in situ reduction layer (fig. S3C), but with considerable agglomeration (figs. S10 and S11), which is undoubtedly detrimental to catalytic performance. The V2O3 serves as both a potent in situ reducing agent and stabilizer. Its rough surface offers numerous anchor sites and exerts steric hindrance effects, influencing the nucleation and growth kinetics of Pt nanoparticles while impeding their migration and aggregation (30).To address this bottleneck issue, various strategies have been developed, including selective active site engineering (20, 21), three-dimensional structure design (22, 23), and carbon layer protection (24, 25).

Using a nationally representative sample, we assessed the association of two dimensions of social media use\u2014how much it\u2019s routinely used and how emotionally connected users are to the platforms\u2014with three health-related outcomes: social well-being, positive mental health, and self-rated health.\n \n\n We found that routine social media use\u2014for example, using social media as part of everyday routine and responding to content that others share\u2014is positively associated with all three health outcomes. Emotional connection to social media\u2014for example, checking apps excessively out of fear of missing out, being disappointed about or feeling disconnected from friends when not logged into social media\u2014is negatively associated with all three outcomes.\n \n\n In more general terms, these findings suggest that as long as we are mindful users, routine use may not in itself be a problem.

We know that having a strong social network is associated with positive mental health and well-being. Routine social media use may compensate for diminishing face-to-face social interactions in people\u2019s busy lives.

Specifically, while the benefits were generally associated with younger age, better education, and being white, the harms were associated with older age, less education, and being a racial minority. Indeed, these findings are consistent with the body of work on communication inequalities and health disparities that our lab, the Viswanath lab, has documented over the past 15 or so years.

Using a nationally representative sample, we assessed the association of two dimensions of social media use\u2014how much it\u2019s routinely used and how emotionally connected users are to the platforms\u2014with three health-related outcomes: social well-being, positive mental health, and self-rated health.\n \n\n We found that routine social media use\u2014for example, using social media as part of everyday routine and responding to content that others share\u2014is positively associated with all three health outcomes. Emotional connection to social media\u2014for example, checking apps excessively out of fear of missing out, being disappointed about or feeling disconnected from friends when not logged into social media\u2014is negatively associated with all three outcomes.\n \n\n In more general terms, these findings suggest that as long as we are mindful users, routine use may not in itself be a problem. Indeed, it could be beneficial.\n \n\n For those with unhealthy social media use, behavioral interventions may help. For example, programs that develop \u201ceffortful control\u201d skills\u2014the ability to self-regulate behavior\u2014have been widely shown to be useful in dealing with problematic Internet and social media use.\n \n\n We\u2019re used to hearing that social media use is harmful to mental health and well-being, particularly for young people. Did it surprise you to find that it can have positive effects?\n \n\n The findings go against what some might expect, which is intriguing. We know that having a strong social network is associated with positive mental health and well-being. Routine social media use may compensate for diminishing face-to-face social interactions in people\u2019s busy lives. Social media may provide individuals with a platform that overcomes barriers of distance and time, allowing them to connect and reconnect with others and thereby expand and strengthen their in-person networks and interactions. Indeed, there is some empirical evidence supporting this.\n \n\n On the other hand, a growing body of research has demonstrated that social media use is negatively associated with mental health and well-being, particularly among young people\u2014for example, it may contribute to increased risk of depression and anxiety symptoms.\n \n\n Our findings suggest that the ways that people are using social media may have more of an impact on their mental health and well-being than just the frequency and duration of their use.\n \n\n What disparities did you find in the ways that social media use benefits and harms certain populations? What concerns does this raise?\n \n\n My co-authors Rachel McCloud, Vish Viswanath, and I found that the benefits and harms associated with social media use varied across demographic, socioeconomic, and racial population sub-groups. Specifically, while the benefits were generally associated with younger age, better education, and being white, the harms were associated with older age, less education, and being a racial minority. Indeed, these findings are consistent with the body of work on communication inequalities and health disparities that our lab, the Viswanath lab, has documented over the past 15 or so years. We know that education, income, race, and ethnicity influence people\u2019s access to, and ability to act on, health information from media, including the Internet.

You must answer questions solely on the basis of the information provided in the prompt.", "user_request": "What are the main legal arguments for and against the FTC's Non-Compete Rule?", "context_document": "Legal Authority\nThe FTC relied on Sections 5 and 6(g) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act) in promulgating\nthe Non-Compete Rule. Section 5 prohibits \u201cunfair methods of competition\u201d (UMC) and empowers the\nFTC to enforce that prohibition through adjudication. Section 6 is titled \u201cAdditional powers of\nCommission.\u201d It confers a range of authorities, most of which involve investigations and the publication\nof reports. The provision also includes Section 6(g), which empowers the FTC to \u201cfrom time to time\nclassify corporations and . . . to make rules and regulations for the purpose of carrying out\u201d the FTC Act.\nSections 5 and 6(g) were both part of the original FTC Act, which Congress enacted in 1914. Since the\nstatute\u2019s enactment, Congress has adopted several laws granting the FTC rulemaking authority over\ndiscrete subjects, including the Wool Products Labeling Act, the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act,\nthe Fur Products Labeling Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act.\nThe FTC first asserted that Section 6(g) endows it with general substantive rulemaking power in 1962,\nand the agency adopted a number of trade regulation rules in the years that followed. Some of those rules\ndefined certain conduct as both a UMC and an \u201cunfair or deceptive act or practice\u201d (UDAP)\u2014a separate\ncategory of conduct prohibited by Section 5. Other rules relied only on the FTC\u2019s UDAP power. One rule\nrelied solely on the FTC\u2019s competition authority, but was never enforced and has been repealed.\nIn the 1970s, a trade association challenged the FTC\u2019s authority to issue substantive rules under\nSection 6(g) in National Petroleum Refiners Association v. FTC. The trade association argued that\nSection 6(g) authorized only procedural rules, emphasizing that the FTC had not asserted substantive\nrulemaking authority under Section 6(g) until 1962 and that FTC officials had occasionally denied the\nexistence of such authority. The trade association also contended that Congress\u2019s enactment of several\nstatutes granting the FTC specific rulemaking authorities implied that the FTC lacked general rulemaking\nauthority.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected those arguments. In affirming the FTC\u2019s power to\nissue legislative rules under Section 6(g), the court relied on appellate decisions construing similar\nstatutes as authorizing substantive rulemaking, the advantages of rulemaking in effectuating the FTC\nCongressional Research Service 3\nAct\u2019s purposes, and the absence of any limiting language in the statutory text. The D.C. Circuit\ndownplayed the fact that the FTC had not claimed general rulemaking authority until 1962, reasoning that\nthe agency\u2019s earlier interpretation of its legal authority did not warrant judicial deference. The court also\nconcluded that Congress may have provided the FTC with more specific rulemaking authorities based on\n\u201cuncertainty, understandable caution, and a desire to avoid litigation,\u201d rather than a firm conviction that\nthe FTC lacked general rulemaking authority.\nTwo years after the National Petroleum Refiners decision, Congress enacted the Magnuson-Moss Act,\nwhich imposed special procedural requirements for the FTC\u2019s UDAP rules and eliminated the FTC\u2019s\nauthority to issue such rules under Section 6(g). Magnuson-Moss did not by its terms affect the FTC\u2019s\nauthority to issue UMC rules: the statute included a provision disclaiming an intent to affect \u201cany\nauthority of the Commission to prescribe rules (including interpretive rules), and general statements of\npolicy, with respect to unfair methods of competition.\u201d\nDespite this language in Magnuson-Moss, the FTC\u2019s putative authority to issue UMC rules has been\ndormant since the enactment of that statute. The Non-Compete Rule marks the first rule promulgated\nunder Section 6(g) since the 1970s and the second rule ever that relies solely upon the FTC\u2019s competition\nauthority.\nA 1983 decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit agreed with the D.C. Circuit\u2019s\nreasoning in National Petroleum Refiners, but no other federal appellate court has addressed the FTC\u2019s\nauthority to issue legislative rules under Section 6(g). Whether the FTC possesses such authority remains\nunsettled; some commentators have argued that National Petroleum Refiners was wrongly decided and\nthat it is unlikely that modern courts would reach the same conclusion.\nIn issuing the Non-Compete Rule, the FTC defended its authority to issue substantive rules under\nSection 6(g) by pointing to the provision\u2019s plain meaning and the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in National\nPetroleum Refiners. The FTC also argued that Congress implicitly ratified the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in\nboth the Magnuson-Moss Act and the Federal Trade Commission Improvements Act of 1980 (the 1980\nAmendments). The 1980 Amendments imposed procedural requirements that the FTC must follow in\nissuing any \u201crule.\u201d It defined the term \u201crule\u201d to include rules promulgated under Section 6 or\nMagnuson-Moss. The statute excluded from that definition \u201cinterpretive rules, rules involving\nCommission management or personnel, general statements of policy, or rules relating to Commission\norganization, procedure, or practice.\u201d The FTC argued that this exclusion confirms its authority to issue\nrules under Section 6 that are not merely \u201cinterpretive rules, rules involving Commission management or\npersonnel, general statements of policy, or rules relating to Commission organization, procedure, or\npractice.\u201d\nThe FTC\u2019s authority to issue the Non-Compete Rule depends not only on whether Section 6(g) authorizes\nlegislative rulemaking, but also on the scope of Section 5\u2019s prohibition of UMC. The Supreme Court has\nrepeatedly said that Section 5 is broader than the Sherman Act and the Clayton Act (the other core federal\nantitrust laws). However, the scope of this additional coverage\u2014often called the FTC\u2019s \u201cstandalone\u201d\nSection 5 authority\u2014is unsettled.\nUnder previous leadership, the FTC took a narrow view of its standalone Section 5 authority. In a 2015\npolicy statement, the FTC indicated that decisions to bring standalone Section 5 actions would be guided\nby considerations of consumer welfare, that the FTC would evaluate challenged conduct under \u201ca\nframework similar to the rule of reason,\u201d and that the FTC was less likely to bring a standalone Section 5\naction if enforcement of the Sherman Act or Clayton Act was sufficient to address the relevant\ncompetitive harm.\nThe FTC rescinded this policy statement in 2021 and issued a new Section 5 policy statement the\nfollowing year. In the 2022 policy statement, the FTC identified \u201ctwo key criteria\u201d it will consider in\nevaluating whether a \u201cmethod of competition\u201d is \u201cunfair.\u201d First, the FTC indicated that \u201cunfair\u201d conduct\nCongressional Research Service 4\n\u201cmay be coercive, exploitative, collusive, abusive, deceptive, predatory, or involve the use of economic\npower of a similar nature,\u201d and \u201cmay also be otherwise restrictive or exclusionary.\u201d Second, the FTC\nexplained that such conduct \u201cmust tend to negatively affect competitive conditions\u201d\u2014for example, by\nforeclosing or impairing the opportunities of market participants, reducing competition between rivals,\nlimiting choice, or otherwise harming consumers. The 2022 policy statement indicated that this second\ninquiry will not turn on whether conduct directly causes harm in particular cases, but instead will focus on\nwhether conduct \u201chas a tendency to generate negative consequences.\u201d\nIn promulgating the Non-Compete Rule, the FTC found that non-competes violate Section 5 because they\nrepresent \u201crestrictive and exclusionary conduct that tends to negatively affect competitive conditions\u201d in\nlabor markets and product and service markets. The FTC also determined that non-competes for workers\nother than senior executives violate Section 5 because they constitute \u201cexploitative and coercive conduct\nthat tends to negatively affect competitive conditions\u201d in labor markets and product and service markets.\n(A previous Legal Sidebar provides a more extensive discussion of the FTC\u2019s justification for the\nNon-Compete Rule.)\nTwo FTC Commissioners voted against the Non-Compete Rule, arguing that the FTC lacks the authority\nto issue substantive competition regulations and that the evidence did not justify a categorical prohibition\nof non-competes.", "full_prompt": "Do not use any prior knowledge or external resources. You must answer questions solely on the basis of the information provided in the prompt.\n\nWhat are the main legal arguments for and against the FTC's Non-Compete Rule?\n\nLegal Authority\nThe FTC relied on Sections 5 and 6(g) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act) in promulgating\nthe Non-Compete Rule. Section 5 prohibits \u201cunfair methods of competition\u201d (UMC) and empowers the\nFTC to enforce that prohibition through adjudication. Section 6 is titled \u201cAdditional powers of\nCommission.\u201d It confers a range of authorities, most of which involve investigations and the publication\nof reports. The provision also includes Section 6(g), which empowers the FTC to \u201cfrom time to time\nclassify corporations and . . . to make rules and regulations for the purpose of carrying out\u201d the FTC Act.\nSections 5 and 6(g) were both part of the original FTC Act, which Congress enacted in 1914. Since the\nstatute\u2019s enactment, Congress has adopted several laws granting the FTC rulemaking authority over\ndiscrete subjects, including the Wool Products Labeling Act, the Textile Fiber Products Identification Act,\nthe Fur Products Labeling Act, the Flammable Fabrics Act, and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act.\nThe FTC first asserted that Section 6(g) endows it with general substantive rulemaking power in 1962,\nand the agency adopted a number of trade regulation rules in the years that followed. Some of those rules\ndefined certain conduct as both a UMC and an \u201cunfair or deceptive act or practice\u201d (UDAP)\u2014a separate\ncategory of conduct prohibited by Section 5. Other rules relied only on the FTC\u2019s UDAP power. One rule\nrelied solely on the FTC\u2019s competition authority, but was never enforced and has been repealed.\nIn the 1970s, a trade association challenged the FTC\u2019s authority to issue substantive rules under\nSection 6(g) in National Petroleum Refiners Association v. FTC. The trade association argued that\nSection 6(g) authorized only procedural rules, emphasizing that the FTC had not asserted substantive\nrulemaking authority under Section 6(g) until 1962 and that FTC officials had occasionally denied the\nexistence of such authority. The trade association also contended that Congress\u2019s enactment of several\nstatutes granting the FTC specific rulemaking authorities implied that the FTC lacked general rulemaking\nauthority.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit rejected those arguments. In affirming the FTC\u2019s power to\nissue legislative rules under Section 6(g), the court relied on appellate decisions construing similar\nstatutes as authorizing substantive rulemaking, the advantages of rulemaking in effectuating the FTC\nCongressional Research Service 3\nAct\u2019s purposes, and the absence of any limiting language in the statutory text. The D.C. Circuit\ndownplayed the fact that the FTC had not claimed general rulemaking authority until 1962, reasoning that\nthe agency\u2019s earlier interpretation of its legal authority did not warrant judicial deference. The court also\nconcluded that Congress may have provided the FTC with more specific rulemaking authorities based on\n\u201cuncertainty, understandable caution, and a desire to avoid litigation,\u201d rather than a firm conviction that\nthe FTC lacked general rulemaking authority.\nTwo years after the National Petroleum Refiners decision, Congress enacted the Magnuson-Moss Act,\nwhich imposed special procedural requirements for the FTC\u2019s UDAP rules and eliminated the FTC\u2019s\nauthority to issue such rules under Section 6(g). Magnuson-Moss did not by its terms affect the FTC\u2019s\nauthority to issue UMC rules: the statute included a provision disclaiming an intent to affect \u201cany\nauthority of the Commission to prescribe rules (including interpretive rules), and general statements of\npolicy, with respect to unfair methods of competition.\u201d\nDespite this language in Magnuson-Moss, the FTC\u2019s putative authority to issue UMC rules has been\ndormant since the enactment of that statute. The Non-Compete Rule marks the first rule promulgated\nunder Section 6(g) since the 1970s and the second rule ever that relies solely upon the FTC\u2019s competition\nauthority.\nA 1983 decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit agreed with the D.C. Circuit\u2019s\nreasoning in National Petroleum Refiners, but no other federal appellate court has addressed the FTC\u2019s\nauthority to issue legislative rules under Section 6(g). Whether the FTC possesses such authority remains\nunsettled; some commentators have argued that National Petroleum Refiners was wrongly decided and\nthat it is unlikely that modern courts would reach the same conclusion.\nIn issuing the Non-Compete Rule, the FTC defended its authority to issue substantive rules under\nSection 6(g) by pointing to the provision\u2019s plain meaning and the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in National\nPetroleum Refiners. The FTC also argued that Congress implicitly ratified the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in\nboth the Magnuson-Moss Act and the Federal Trade Commission Improvements Act of 1980 (the 1980\nAmendments). The 1980 Amendments imposed procedural requirements that the FTC must follow in\nissuing any \u201crule.\u201d It defined the term \u201crule\u201d to include rules promulgated under Section 6 or\nMagnuson-Moss. The statute excluded from that definition \u201cinterpretive rules, rules involving\nCommission management or personnel, general statements of policy, or rules relating to Commission\norganization, procedure, or practice.\u201d The FTC argued that this exclusion confirms its authority to issue\nrules under Section 6 that are not merely \u201cinterpretive rules, rules involving Commission management or\npersonnel, general statements of policy, or rules relating to Commission organization, procedure, or\npractice.\u201d\nThe FTC\u2019s authority to issue the Non-Compete Rule depends not only on whether Section 6(g) authorizes\nlegislative rulemaking, but also on the scope of Section 5\u2019s prohibition of UMC.

Although most low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSILs) can regress naturally within 1\u20132 years, while high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSILs) have a higher potential for malignant transformation. Current treatment methods for SIL comprise ablative treatments (such as cryotherapy, radiofrequency, and focused ultrasound treatments) and excision procedures (including cold knife conization, cervical loop electrosurgical excision procedure, and laser conization). In the past few years, there has been an increase in the occurrence of SIL among younger woman. As a result, clinicians and patients are not only concerned about lesion clearance, but also paying attention to cervical wound healing, which has emerged as a new area of interest.\n \n\n SARS-CoV-2, a novel coronavirus, emerged in 2019 and caused a global pandemic of acute respiratory illness named SARS-CoV-2. With the deepening of research, it has been found that SARS-CoV-2 not only affects the respiratory system, but also the digestive system, nervous system, cardiovascular system, endocrine system, reproductive system, and can cause a decrease in the body\u2019s immunity, leading to secondary bacterial infections. However, little is known about the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cervical wound healing after treatment. In this study, we investigated the wound healing status of patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 within one month after cervical treatment and compared them with a control group of patients who underwent cervical treatment after the disappearance of infection symptoms. \n \n\n 2 Materials and methods\n 2.1 Study population\n A total of 60 patients, aged 19 to 53 years old, who underwent cervical treatment for SILs at the gynecology cervical clinic of the People\u2019s Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region from November 2022 to February 2023 were recruited as the study population. Informed consent was obtained from all subjects involved in the study. The inclusion criteria for patients were a diagnosis of SIL using the three-step method of cervical cytology, which including HPV test, colposcopy, and cervical biopsy.\n \n\n The exclusion criteria included: patients with acute or subacute genital infections, genital malignancy, a history of hysterectomy or pelvic radiotherapy, a history of cervical excision, cervical ablation, or medication treatment, pregnant or lactating women, uncontrolled diabetes, hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, severe cardiovascular, cerebral, pulmonary, hepatic, or renal dysfunction, or comorbidities of immunological disorders or immunosuppressive drug use.\n \n\n The experimental group consisted of 29 patients who exhibited symptoms (such as fever, sore throat, and cough) and were confirmed to have SARS-CoV-2 infection through antigen testing within one month of receiving cervical treatment. The control group comprised t31 patients who underwent cervical treatment at least one week after their SARS-CoV-2 symptoms had resolved. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and was approved by the Ethics Committee of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region People\u2019s Hospital (no. KY-KJT02023-10) on August 01, 2022.\n \n\n 2.2 Treatment methods\n All cervical treatments were performed 3\u20137 days after the end of menstruation, excluding patients who have reached menopause. To assess the extent of the cervical lesion, acetic acid and iodine are applied to stain the junction of the cervical squamous epithelium and columnar epithelium. Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine is administered at the 4 quadrants of the cervix. The cervical SILs are treated using either loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) or ablative treatment such as focused ultrasound or radiofrequency ablation. Details regarding the indications for patients undergoing LEEP excision or ablative treatment can be found in the Supplementary materials.\n \n\n The (LEEP) is performed using a triangular-shaped electrosurgical knife with a length of 15\u201320 mm, The treatment area is set to approximately 5 mm from the outer edge of the lesion, utilizing a cutting-coagulation mode with a power setting of 40 W. Depending on the type of transformation zone, different lengths of lesion tissue are removed (7\u201310 mm for type 1, 10\u201315 mm for type 2, and 15\u201325 mm for type 3). Following excision, a ball-shaped electrode is used to perform electrocoagulation for hemostasis at the surgical site.\n \n\n The power setting for focused ultrasound therapy is between 3.5 and 4.5 W. Treatment is performed in a circular scanning pattern from the lesion area toward the normal area. During the treatment, the focused ultrasound probe is kept in close contact with the treatment area. The treatment should be stopped when local tissues become concave or hardened. The treatment range should extend beyond the edge of the cervical lesion by approximately 2\u20135 mm. The power for radiofrequency ablation is set to 30 W. The treatment area extends beyond the area that tests positive in acetic acid and iodine tests by 2\u20135 mm. An auto-coagulator knife is used to ablate the cervical epithelium from the inside out, until the epithelium is thermocoagulated to a light yellow color and the wound has formed a shallow cone shape.\n \n\n 2.3 Cervical wound healing evaluation after treatment\n Assessing the rate of wound healing is a key factor in evaluating the progress of wound recovery. A comprehensive evaluation of the healing process includes recording the cervical wound condition immediately after treatment and at a specified time-point after treatment. The wound area is measured using Imagine J software (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). To calculate the wound healing rate, the formula [(treatment wound area - remaining wound area)/treatment wound area] \u00d7 100% is applied. This approach enables clinicians to quantitatively assess the healing process and monitor the progress of wound closure over time. Specifically, the calculation is performed on the 30th day after treatment, providing a comprehensive evaluation of healing rate.\n \n\n 2.4 Vaginal discharge test before and one month after treatment\n Before undergoing cervical treatment, each patient underwent a vaginal discharge examination to rule out vaginal inflammation. During the one-month follow-up vaginal colposcopy after receiving cervical treatment, another examination of vaginal discharge was conducted to assess the vaginal microbiota and inflammatory condition.\n \n\n 4 Results\n There were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of age, disease severity, treatment methods, or treatment duration. The mean time of SARS-CoV-2 infection in post-treatment infection group is 15.83 \u00b1 9.74 days after cervical treatment, and the mean time of SARS-CoV-2 infection in treatment after infection recovered group is 39.13 \u00b1 9.80 days before cervical treatment.\n \n\n Compared with the control group, the experimental group had a lower wound healing rate 83.77 (62.04, 97.09) % vs. 98.64(97.10, 99.46)%, p < 0.001. The Box and whisker plot of the wound healing rate for the two group was shown in Supplementary Figure 1. Also the experimental group had a higher scab non-shedding rate 24.14% (7/29) on the 30th day after treatment when compared with control group (24.14% vs. 3.22%, p = 0.024).\n \n\n We conducted further analysis to explore the potential correlation between delayed wound healing and the timing of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the experimental group. Out of the 7 patients who experienced delayed wound healing, 5 patients (71.43%) contracted SARS-CoV-2 within 2 weeks after undergoing cervical treatment, only 2 (2/7 or 28.57%) patients infected with delayed wound healing infected SARS-CoV-2 2 weeks after cervical treatment. It is worth noting that in the control group, there was only 1 patient who experienced poor wound healing, and the cervical treatment of this patient was conducted 45 days after SARS-CoV-2 infection.\n \n\n Pre-treatment vaginal discharge tests for all patients exhibited normal levels of white blood cell counts and leukocyte esterase, with no detection of trichomonas vaginalis, pseudohyphae, or budding spores in both pre and post-treatment assessments. We compared the correlation between white blood cell count and leukocyte esterase in vaginal discharge with cervical healing. The results of the chi-square test for contingency table revealed no significant correlation between white blood cell count or leukocyte esterase in vaginal discharge and delayed wound healing of the cervix (defined as the non-shedding of scabs after 1 month of treatment) (p = 0.947 and 0.970, respectively).", "full_prompt": "[question]\n I'm making a presentation to first-year biology students based on this article.

For example, a loan repayment program may be an\neffective incentive when jobs are plentiful for recent graduates who are weighing multiple\nemployment opportunities but may be unnecessary when there are fewer employment\nopportunities. In relatively recent years, for instance, law school graduates have had fewer\nemployment opportunities57 and may take a public interest or government job because of more\nlimited private sector opportunities.

For example, one study\nfound that healthcare providers who practice in rural areas would have done so without receiving\na loan repayment award.58\nAlthough in some cases loan forgiveness or loan repayment programs may appear to be\nunnecessary, in some instances there is evidence showing that participants would likely not have\ntaken a particular position but for loan repayment. For example, the NIH examined its IRP loan\nrepayment program and found that most loan repayment award recipients had competing job\noffers and stated that the potential for loan repayment was an attractive benefit that was unique to\nthe NIH employment. This was particularly true for physicians who often had competing job\noffers at higher salaries. Physicians who received loan repayment benefits were also more likely\nto remain in research at the NIH, which demonstrates that loan repayment may be an important\nrecruitment and retention tool.59\nOther federal agencies have found that loan repayment programs are effective at recruiting and\nmaintaining staff, but there are indications that some aspects of a program\u2019s design may\nundermine its effectiveness.60 For example, discretionary programs may have their funding\nreduced or cut altogether, thus making the availability of loan repayment benefits to individuals\nuncertain. The effectiveness of these programs as a recruitment incentive may be hard to\ndetermine because job applicants do not know whether they will receive a loan repayment award\nuntil after having accepted a job.61 Additionally, loan repayment award amounts may not be a sufficient incentive for individuals to\nenter into and remain in certain professions. Some researchers have theorized that loan repayment\nprograms may be more likely to be successful in meeting recruitment and retention needs if the\nfinancial benefits are sufficiently meaningful to offset a reasonable share of the costs associated\nwith borrowing to pursue a postsecondary education.62\nSimilarly, in some circumstances, while the dollar amount of loan repayment benefits may be\nperceived as sufficient, additional program design elements such as an individual\u2019s responsibility\nto pay federal income taxes associated with receiving a loan payment may make the benefit less\nattractive for an individual. Specifically, under the Government Employee Student Loan\nRepayment Program (GESLRP), participants are responsible for the tax liability, which some\nagencies estimate can account for 39% of the loan repayment amount.63 Some agencies suggest\nthat this makes the program less attractive to participants than it would be if benefits were\nexcluded from taxation.64\nAnother consideration is the short-term nature of many of these programs (e.g., providing loan\nrepayment benefits in exchange for a two-year employment commitment), which may contribute\nto turnover, as individuals may decide to change jobs once they have realized the full benefit of a\nprogram. This could possibly lead to a less stable workforce for employers. For example, some\nresearchers have found that individuals who have a service obligation have shorter tenures in a\nparticular position than do individuals who do not have service obligations.65\n", "full_prompt": "In assessing the influence of a loan forgiveness or loan repayment program on an individual\u2019s\nemployment choice, one issue to consider is whether, in the absence of such a program, the\nrecipient would have engaged in the qualifying service.

Personalized cancer vaccines\n Thousands of NHS cancer patients in England could soon access trials of a new vaccine treatment. It's designed to prime the immune system to target cancer cells and reduce recurrence risk. These vaccines are also hoped to produce fewer side effects than conventional chemotherapy. Thirty hospitals have joined the Cancer Vaccine Launch Pad, which matches patients with upcoming trials using the same mRNA technology found in current COVID-19 jabs. Over 200 patients from the UK, Germany, Belgium, Spain and Sweden will receive up to 15 doses of the personalized vaccine, with the study expected to complete by 2027.\n \n\n 2. Test to identify 18 early-stage cancers\n Researchers in the US have developed a test they say can identify 18 early-stage cancers. Instead of the usual invasive and costly methods, Novelna's test works by analyzing a patient's blood protein. In a screening of 440 people already diagnosed with cancer, the test correctly identified 93% of stage 1 cancers in men and 84% in women. The researchers believe the findings \"pave the way for a cost-effective, highly accurate, multi-cancer screening test that can be implemented on a population-wide scale\". It's early days, however. With such a small sample screening and a lack of information on co-existing conditions, the test is currently more of \"a starting point for developing a new generation of screening tests for the early detection of cancer\".\n \n\n \n\n 3. Seven-minute cancer treatment jab\n England's National Health Service (NHS) is to be the first in the world to make use of a cancer treatment injection, which takes just seven minutes to administer, rather than the current time of up to an hour to have the same drug via intravenous infusion. This will not only speed up the treatment process for patients, but also free up time for medical professionals. The drug, Atezolizumab or Tecentriq, treats cancers including lung and breast, and it's expected most of the 3,600 NHS patients in England currently receiving it intravenously will now switch to the jab.\n \n\n 4. Precision oncology\n Precision oncology is the \u201cbest new weapon to defeat cancer\u201d, the chief executive of Genetron Health, Sizhen Wang, says in a blog for the World Economic Forum. This involves studying the genetic makeup and molecular characteristics of cancer tumours in individual patients. The precision oncology approach identifies changes in cells that might be causing the cancer to grow and spread. Personalized treatments can then be developed. The 100,000 Genomes Project, a National Health Service initiative, studied more than 13,000 tumour samples from UK cancer patients, successfully integrating genomic data to more accurately pin-point effective treatment. Because precision oncology treatments are targeted \u2013 as opposed to general treatments like chemotherapy \u2013 it can mean less harm to healthy cells and fewer side effects as a result.\n \n\n 5. Artificial intelligence fights cancer\n In India, World Economic Forum partners are using emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to transform cancer care. For example, AI-based risk profiling can help screen for common cancers like breast cancer, leading to early diagnosis. AI technology can also be used to analyze X-rays to identify cancers in places where imaging experts might not be available. These are two of 18 cancer interventions that The Centre for the Fourth Industrial Revolution India, a collaboration with the Forum, hopes to accelerate.\n \n\n \n\n 6. Greater prediction capabilities\n Lung cancer kills more people in the US yearly than the next three deadliest cancers combined. It's notoriously hard to detect the early stages of the disease with X-rays and scans alone. However, MIT scientists have developed an AI learning model to predict a person's likelihood of developing lung cancer up to six years in advance via a low-dose CT scan. Trained using complex imaging data, 'Sybil' can forecast both short- and long-term lung cancer risk, according to a recent study. \"We found that while we as humans couldn't quite see where the cancer was, the model could still have some predictive power as to which lung would eventually develop cancer,\" said co-author Jeremy Wohlwend.\n \n\n 7. Clues in the DNA of cancer\n At Cambridge University Hospitals in England, the DNA of cancer tumours from 12,000 patients is revealing new clues about the causes of cancer, scientists say. By analyzing genomic data, oncologists are identifying different mutations that have contributed to each person\u2019s cancer. For example, exposure to smoking or UV light, or internal malfunctions in cells. These are like \u201cfingerprints in a crime scene\u201d, the scientists say \u2013 and more of them are being found. \u201cWe uncovered 58 new mutational signatures and broadened our knowledge of cancer,\u201d says study author Dr Andrea Degasperi, from Cambridge\u2019s Department of Oncology.\n \n\n \n\n 8. Liquid and synthetic biopsies\n Biopsies are the main way doctors diagnose cancer \u2013 but the process is invasive and involves removing a section of tissue from the body, sometimes surgically, so it can be examined in a laboratory. Liquid biopsies are an easier and less invasive solution where blood samples can be tested for signs of cancer. Synthetic biopsies are another innovation that can force cancer cells to reveal themselves during the earliest stages of the disease.\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n 9. CAR-T-cell therapy\n A treatment that makes immune cells hunt down and kill cancer cells was declared a success for leukaemia patients in 2022. Known as CAR-T-cell therapy, it involves removing and genetically altering immune cells, called T cells, from cancer patients. The altered cells then produce proteins called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), which can recognize and destroy cancer cells. In the journal Nature, scientists at the University of Pennsylvania announced that two of the first people treated with CAR-T-cell therapy were still in remission 12 years on.\n \n\n However, the US Food and Drug Administration is currently investigating whether the process can in fact cause cancer, after 33 cases of secondary cancer were observed in patients receiving CAR-T therapies. The jury is still out as to whether the therapy is to blame but, as a precaution, the drug packaging now carries a warning.\n \n\n 10. Fighting pancreatic cancer\n Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest cancers. It is rarely diagnosed before it starts to spread and has a survival rate of less than 5% over five years. At the University of California San Diego School of Medicine, scientists developed a test that identified 95% of early pancreatic cancers in a study. The research, published in Nature Communications Medicine, explains how biomarkers in extracellular vesicles \u2013 particles that regulate communication between cells \u2013 were used to detect pancreatic, ovarian and bladder cancer at stages I and II.\n \n\n Scientists are also getting closer to a cure. A new US/UK study has discovered that pancreatic cancer shuts down particular molecules in a key gene. The hope now is that the new knowledge \"could lead to the development of more effective treatment options in the future\u201d, Dr Chris Macdonald, head of research at Pancreatic Cancer UK, told The Guardian.\n \n\n \n\n 11. A tablet to cut breast cancer risk\n A drug that could halve the chance of women developing breast cancer is being tested out by England's National Health Service (NHS). It will be made available to almost 300,000 women seen as being at most risk of developing breast cancer, which is the most common type of cancer in the UK. The drug, named anastrozole, cuts the level of oestrogen women produce by blocking the enzyme aromatase. It has already been used for many years as a breast cancer treatment but has now been repurposed as a preventive medicine. \u201cThis is the first drug to be repurposed through a world-leading new programme to help us realize the full potential of existing medicines in new uses to save and improve more lives on the NHS,\" says NHS Chief Executive Amanda Pritchard.", "full_prompt": "\"================\n <TEXT PASSAGE>\n =======\n 1.

We linked the app data with survey data with electronic health records.\u201d\n \n\n Dr. Bennett said that they then analyzed the link between eating intervals, including the participants\u2019 total eating window, the time between their wake-up and bedtime, and the time between their last meal and bedtime, with changes in their weight over about six years.\n \n\n The researchers found that the timing from the first meal of the day to the last meal of the day was not associated with changes in weight. However, they did find that eating more frequent, larger meals were associated with weight gain.\n \n\n Data on intermittent fasting is still emerging, so no one study offers all the proof that the method is effective or ineffective. This particular study also had several limitations to consider.\n \n\n First, researchers could only analyze data from study participants who downloaded and used the Daily24 app. This exclusion may have impacted the study population and results.\n \n\n They only recruited participants from three health systems, meaning the results cannot necessarily be generalized. Almost 78% of participants were women and white, indicating the need for more diverse future studies.\n \n\n The study also had a relatively short follow-up time, leading to fewer weight measurements and declines in measurement precision. Researchers were also unable to measure participants\u2019 intentions to lose weight before their enrollment in the study.\n \n\n The way researchers measured eating periods could not evaluate more complex fasting methods. Data also relied on participants\u2019 self-reporting, and food was not standardized or assessed for quality.\n \n\n \u201cThis study did not specifically assess patterns like intermittent fasting. We also did not assess diet quality for the meals reported in the app,\u201d Dr. Bennett noted to MNT.\n \n\n \u201cRandomized controlled trials that adjust for caloric intake are needed to further test the role of timing of eating in weight gain prevention and also weight loss,\u201d she added.\n https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/weight-loss-study-finds-calorie-restriction-more-effective-than-intermittent-fasting#Intermittent-fasting:-risks-and-benefits"}

Biologic approaches targeting Type 2 cytokines are emerging as potential therapeutic options. Here, we summarize the up-to-date evidence of pathophysiologic mechanisms and diagnosis/management approaches to the patients with NERD with its phenotypic classification.\n \n\n Introduction\n Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA) and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the most commonly prescribed drugs in the world (Do\u00f1a et al., 2012); however, they are considered the most common causes of hypersensitivity reactions to drugs (Blanca-Lopez et al., 2018). Hypersensitivity reactions to NSAIDs have recently been classified by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) and European Network of Drug Allergy (ENDA): 1) pharmacologic reactions (mediated by cyclooxygenase [COX]-1 inhibitions) include NSAID-exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD), NSAID-exacerbated cutaneous disease (NECD) and NSAID-induced urticarial/angioedema (NIUA), and present cross-intolerance to various COX-1 inhibitors; 2) selective responses (mediated by immunologic mechanisms) include single NSAIDs-induced urticaria, angioedema and/or anaphylaxis (SNIUAA) and single NSAIDs-induced delayed hypersensitivity reactions (SNIDHR) (Kowalski and Stevenson, 2013). NERD is a major phenotype among cross-intolerant categories of NSAID hypersensitivity and had been called ASA-induced asthma, ASA-intolerant asthma, ASA-sensitive asthma; however, NERD and ASA-exacerbated respiratory disease (AERD) are commonly used (S\u00e1nchez-Borges, 2019). The prevalence of NERD is reported to be 5.5% to 12.4% in the general population (Lee et al., 2018a; Chu et al., 2019; Taniguchi et al., 2019), 7.1% among adult asthmatics and 14.9% among severe asthmatics (Rajan et al., 2015), while it rarely occurs in children (Taniguchi et al., 2019). No relationships were found with family history or NSAID administration history (Kowalski et al., 2011; Taniguchi et al., 2019).\n \n\n NERD is characterized by moderate-to-severe asthma and a higher prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) nasal polyps (NPs) with persistent eosinophilic inflammation in the upper and lower airways (Taniguchi et al., 2019) as well as NSAID hypersensitivity where cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) over-production and chronic type 2 airway inflammation are key findings (Taniguchi et al., 2019). The diagnosis of NERD is confirmed by ASA challenge (via orally, bronchially or nasally route) and supported by potential biomarkers (Pham et al., 2017; Cingi and Bayar Muluk, 2020). In addition, in vitro cell activation tests and radiological imaging with nasal endoscopy can aid in NERD diagnosis (Taniguchi et al., 2019). This review updates the current knowledge on pathophysiologic mechanisms including molecular genetic mechanisms as well as the diagnosis and treatment of NERD.\n \n\n Clinical Features\n NERD is characterized by chronic type 2 inflammation in the upper and lower airways; therefore, patients suffer from chronic persistent asthmatic symptoms and CRS with/without NPs, which are exacerbated by ASA/NSAID exposure and refractory to conventional medical or surgical treatment. Some patients are accompanied by cutaneous symptoms such as urticaria, angioedema, flushing or gastrointestinal symptoms (Buchheit and Laidlaw, 2016). Previous studies suggested that NERD is more common in females (middle-age onset) and non-atopics (Choi et al., 2015; Trinh et al., 2018). It was reported that rhinitis symptoms appear and then evolve into CRS which worsens asthmatic symptoms, subsequently followed by ASA intolerance (Szczeklik et al., 2000). However, their clinical presentations and courses have been found to be heterogeneous. It has been increasingly required to classify the subphenotypes of NERD according to its clinical features. One study demonstrated 4 subphenotypes by applying a latent class analysis in a Polish cohort: class 1 patients showing moderate asthma with upper airway symptoms and blood eosinophilia; class 2 patients showing mild asthma with low healthcare use; class 3 patients showing severe asthma with severe exacerbation and airway obstruction; and class 4 patients showing poorly controlled asthma with frequent and severe exacerbation (Bochenek et al., 2014). Another study showed 4 subtypes presenting distinct clinical/biochemical findings in a Korean cohort using a 2-step cluster analysis based on 3 clinical phenotypes (urticaria, CRS and atopy status): subtype 1 (NERD with CRS/atopy and no urticaria), subtype 2 (NERD with CRS and no urticaria/atopy), subtype 3 (NERD without CRS/urticaria), and subtype 4 (NERD with acute/chronic urticaria exacerbated by NSAID exposure) (Lee et al., 2017). Each subtype had distinct features in the aspect of female proportion, the degree of eosinophilia, leukotriene (LT) E4 metabolite levels, the frequency of asthma exacerbation, medication requirements (high-dose ICS-LABA or systemic corticosteroids) and asthma severity, suggesting that stratified strategies according to subtype classification may help achieve better clinical outcomes in the management of NERD.", "full_prompt": "\"================\n <TEXT PASSAGE>\n =======\n Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID)-exacerbated respiratory disease (NERD) is characterized by moderate-to-severe asthma and a higher prevalence of chronic rhinosinusitis/nasal polyps, but is a highly heterogeneous disorder with various clinical manifestations.

MoCRA also expands upon required recordkeeping by manufacturers, packers,\nand distributors. A \u201cresponsible person\u201d63 for a cosmetic product must ensure that it has been\nadequately tested to substantiate safety,64 and that records supporting this substantiation are\nmaintained by the same responsible person.65 Certain products and facilities already regulated\nunder Chapter V of FFDCA as a drug or device are exempt from MoCRA\u2019s safety substantiation\nand recordkeeping requirements.66 However, if such a facility also manufactures or processes\ncosmetic products not subject to FFDCA Chapter V, the exemption does not apply to those\nparticular cosmetic products.67\nEnforcement\nAmong various enforcement mechanisms, under MoCRA, FDA may access and copy all records\nrelated to a cosmetic product that it reasonably believes is likely adulterated and a serious danger\nModernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022 (MoCRA)\nCongressional Research Service 9\nto humans. FDA may access and copy all records necessary to determine whether a cosmetic or\nrelated product is adulterated and a serious threat to human health, barring certain cosmetic\nformula, personnel, research, and financial data records. Accessible records include those related\nto safety substantiation data for cosmetic products and their ingredients.68\nRegistration and Listing\nPrior to MoCRA, cosmetic manufacturers were not required to register their establishments or list\ntheir products with FDA. Instead, according to FDA regulations, owners or operators of\nestablishments that manufactured or packaged cosmetics were requested to register with FDA.69\nLikewise, previous to MoCRA, manufacturers, packers, and distributors of cosmetic products\nwere requested to file a cosmetic product ingredient statement (CPIS) containing certain\ninformation on each cosmetic product they marketed.70 Entities could submit registration\ninformation and CPISs to FDA\u2019s Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP).71\nUnder MoCRA, both facility72 registration and product listings are now required.73 Existing and\nnew facilities that manufacture or process cosmetic products for distribution in the United States\nmust be registered with FDA. These registrations must be renewed every two years and updated\nwithin 60 days of a content revision.74 Domestic facilities registering with FDA must provide the\nfacility\u2019s name, physical address, email address, and phone number, while foreign facilities must\nprovide contact information for an agent within the United States and, if available, electronic\ncontact information. Additionally, a facility must include its registration number, if one was\npreviously assigned, and all brand names associated with cosmetic products sold that were\nmanufactured or processed at that facility. The product categories and responsible person for each\ncosmetic product manufactured or processed at the facility must also be provided.75\nEach responsible person must also ensure the submission of a cosmetic product listing with FDA\nthat is renewed and updated annually.76 The product listing must contain the manufacturing or\nprocessing facility\u2019s registration number, the responsible person\u2019s name and contact number, the\nname of the cosmetic product as it appears on the label, the categories the cosmetic product falls\nunder, and the product\u2019s listing number. Additionally, the product listing must include a list of the\ncosmetic product\u2019s ingredients, \u201cincluding any fragrances, flavors, or colors, with each ingredient\nidentified by name.\u201d77 FDA will assign private product and facility identification numbers upon\ninitial listing submission or registration.78\nWith the advent of MoCRA, FDA reported the VCRP had been discontinued and was no longer\naccepting submissions. In a draft guidance released in August 2023, FDA stated it is developing a\nnew electronic submission portal for registration and listing information.79 FDA noted that this\nnew portal is expected to be available by October 2023.80 In the interim, FDA requests that no\nregistration or listing information be sent to the agency, adding that information previously listed\nin the VCRP will not be transferred.81 In September 2023, FDA released for comment draft\nversions of the prospective electronic submission portal, Cosmetics Direct, and paper forms.82\nMoCRA exempts certain small businesses83 from both facility registration and product listing\nrequirements.84 However, a small business is not exempt from these requirements if it is engaged\nin the manufacturing or processing of higher-risk cosmetic products that \u201cregularly come into\ncontact with [the] mucus membrane of the eye under conditions of use that are customary or\nusual,\u201d \u201c[c]osmetic products that are injected\u201d (see the text box below), \u201cintended for internal\nuse,\u201d or that are meant to \u201calter [one\u2019s] appearance for more than 24 hours under conditions of\nuse that are customary or usual and removal by the consumer is not part of such conditions of use\nthat are customary or usual.\u201d85\nAdditionally, certain products and facilities already regulated under Chapter V of FFDCA as a\ndrug or device are exempt from facility registration and product listing requirements.86 However,\nif such a facility also manufactures or processes cosmetic products not subject to FFDCA Chapter\nV, the exemption does not apply.87\nEnforcement\nUnder MoCRA, if FDA determines that a cosmetic product has a reasonable probability of\ncausing serious harm to human health, and if FDA has a reasonable belief that other products\nmanufactured or processed at the same facility may be similarly affected, FDA may suspend the\nregistration of the facility connected with such products.88 If a facility\u2019s registration is suspended,\nany cosmetic product from that facility is barred from introduction or delivery for introduction\ninto U.S. commerce.89\nBefore suspending a facility\u2019s registration, the FDA must provide notice to a responsible person\nfor the facility specifying the reason for suspension, as well as an opportunity, within five\nbusiness days of the notice, to present a plan to correct the issue identified.90 FDA must provide\nthe responsible person with the opportunity for an informal hearing to review actions required for\nregistration reinstatement and why the facility registration should be reinstated.91 If, based upon\nthe evidence presented at this informal hearing, FDA determines there are inadequate grounds to\ncontinue the suspension, the facility registration will be restored.92 However, if there is\ninsufficient evidence presented, the suspension may continue, and FDA shall require the\nresponsible person to submit a corrective action plan for review.93\nIf at any point FDA determines there is inadequate evidence to justify the continued suspension of\na facility\u2019s registration, the registration shall be promptly reinstated.94\nMandatory Recall\nPrior to MoCRA, FDA did not have the authority to order mandatory recalls of cosmetic\nproducts. The agency could, however, request a company to voluntarily recall cosmetic products\nof concern.114 Under MoCRA, a responsible person may still have the opportunity to voluntarily\nrecall an adulterated or misbranded cosmetic; however, now FDA also has the authority to issue a\nmandatory recall.115 A mandatory recall may be initiated \u201c[i]f the Secretary determines that there\nis a reasonable probability that a cosmetic is adulterated \u2026 or misbranded \u2026 and the use of or\nexposure to such cosmetic will cause serious adverse health consequences or death,\u201d and the\nresponsible person refuses to comply with a voluntary recall in a timely manner. Upon FDA\nissuing an order for a mandatory recall, the responsible person must immediately stop distributing\nthe identified product.116\nIf such an order is issued, the responsible person is entitled to an opportunity for a timely\ninformal hearing to review the adequacy of evidence for the order.117 Depending on the outcome\nof this review, the order may be vacated, continued until a specified date, or amended to further\nrequire the recall of the cosmetic product, along with other measures regarding notifications,\ntimetables, and updates.118 FDA may require the responsible person to issue a notice of recall or\nceased distribution to appropriate persons, including manufacturers, distributors, importers, and\nsellers.119 If a product is recalled, FDA must ensure that a press release announcing the action is\npublished, as well as appropriate alerts and public notices, to provide consumers and retailers\nwith information about the cosmetic product and the circumstances of the recall. If an image of\nthe product is available and appropriate, FDA shall also ensure the publication of that image on\nits website.120 Certain products and facilities already regulated under Chapter V of FFDCA as a\ndrug or device are exempt from MoCRA\u2019s mandatory recall authority.121 However, if such a\nfacility also manufactures or processes cosmetic products not subject to FFDCA Chapter V, the\nexemption does not apply to those particular cosmetic products.122", "full_prompt": "Summarize each cosmetic regulation pre- and post-MoCRA.

Answer with section headings and bullet points.\nPremarket Requirements\nUnlike its authority over drugs and some devices, FDA does not have the authority, either pre- or\npost-MoCRA, to require premarket approval of cosmetics or their ingredients, except for color\nadditives.61 Prior to MoCRA, it was FDA\u2019s position that manufacturers were responsible for\nsubstantiating the safety of their products and ingredients before the products were marketed.62\nWith the passage of MoCRA, manufacturers are now statutorily required to substantiate the safety\nof their products. MoCRA also expands upon required recordkeeping by manufacturers, packers,\nand distributors. A \u201cresponsible person\u201d63 for a cosmetic product must ensure that it has been\nadequately tested to substantiate safety,64 and that records supporting this substantiation are\nmaintained by the same responsible person.65 Certain products and facilities already regulated\nunder Chapter V of FFDCA as a drug or device are exempt from MoCRA\u2019s safety substantiation\nand recordkeeping requirements.66 However, if such a facility also manufactures or processes\ncosmetic products not subject to FFDCA Chapter V, the exemption does not apply to those\nparticular cosmetic products.67\nEnforcement\nAmong various enforcement mechanisms, under MoCRA, FDA may access and copy all records\nrelated to a cosmetic product that it reasonably believes is likely adulterated and a serious danger\nModernization of Cosmetics Regulation Act of 2022 (MoCRA)\nCongressional Research Service 9\nto humans. FDA may access and copy all records necessary to determine whether a cosmetic or\nrelated product is adulterated and a serious threat to human health, barring certain cosmetic\nformula, personnel, research, and financial data records. Accessible records include those related\nto safety substantiation data for cosmetic products and their ingredients.68\nRegistration and Listing\nPrior to MoCRA, cosmetic manufacturers were not required to register their establishments or list\ntheir products with FDA. Instead, according to FDA regulations, owners or operators of\nestablishments that manufactured or packaged cosmetics were requested to register with FDA.69\nLikewise, previous to MoCRA, manufacturers, packers, and distributors of cosmetic products\nwere requested to file a cosmetic product ingredient statement (CPIS) containing certain\ninformation on each cosmetic product they marketed.70 Entities could submit registration\ninformation and CPISs to FDA\u2019s Voluntary Cosmetic Registration Program (VCRP).71\nUnder MoCRA, both facility72 registration and product listings are now required.73 Existing and\nnew facilities that manufacture or process cosmetic products for distribution in the United States\nmust be registered with FDA. These registrations must be renewed every two years and updated\nwithin 60 days of a content revision.74 Domestic facilities registering with FDA must provide the\nfacility\u2019s name, physical address, email address, and phone number, while foreign facilities must\nprovide contact information for an agent within the United States and, if available, electronic\ncontact information. Additionally, a facility must include its registration number, if one was\npreviously assigned, and all brand names associated with cosmetic products sold that were\nmanufactured or processed at that facility. The product categories and responsible person for each\ncosmetic product manufactured or processed at the facility must also be provided.75\nEach responsible person must also ensure the submission of a cosmetic product listing with FDA\nthat is renewed and updated annually.76 The product listing must contain the manufacturing or\nprocessing facility\u2019s registration number, the responsible person\u2019s name and contact number, the\nname of the cosmetic product as it appears on the label, the categories the cosmetic product falls\nunder, and the product\u2019s listing number.

{"system_instruction": "If you cannot answer the question using the given text, respond with \"The text does not contain what you are looking for.\"", "user_request": "Using only the provided text, Is Sickle Cell Disease hereditary?", "context_document": "**What is Sickle Cell Disease?**\n\nSickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein that carries oxygen. Healthy red blood cells are round, and they move through small blood vessels to carry oxygen to all parts of the body. In someone who has SCD, the hemoglobin is abnormal, which causes the red blood cells to become hard and sticky and look like a C-shaped farm tool called a \u201csickle.\u201d The sickle cells die early, which causes a constant shortage of red blood cells. Also, when they travel through small blood vessels, they get stuck and clog the blood flow. This can cause pain and other serious complications (health problems) such as infection, acute chest syndrome and stroke.\nTypes of SCD\nThere are several types of SCD. The specific type of SCD a person has depends on the genes they inherited from their parents. People with SCD inherit genes that contain instructions, or code, for abnormal hemoglobin.\nBelow are the most common types of SCD:\nHbSS\nPeople who have this form of SCD inherit two genes, one from each parent, that code for hemoglobin \u201cS.\u201d Hemoglobin S is an abnormal form of hemoglobin that causes the red cells to become rigid, and sickle shaped. This is commonly called sickle cell anemia and is usually the most severe form of the disease.\n\nHbSC\nPeople who have this form of SCD inherit a hemoglobin \u201cS\u201d gene from one parent and a gene for a different type of abnormal hemoglobin called \u201cC\u201d from the other parent. This is usually a milder form of SCD.\n\nInfographic: 5 Facts You Should Know About Sickle Cell Disease\nInfographic: 5 Facts You Should Know About Sickle Cell Disease\nDid you know SCD affects people from many parts of the world?\n\nHbS beta thalassemia\nPeople who have this form of SCD inherit a hemoglobin \u201cS\u201d gene from one parent and a gene for beta thalassemia, another type of hemoglobin abnormality, from the other parent. There are two types of beta thalassemia: \u201czero\u201d (HbS beta0) and \u201cplus\u201d (HbS beta+). Those with HbS beta0-thalassemia usually have a severe form of SCD. People with HbS beta+-thalassemia tend to have a milder form of SCD.\n\nThere also are a few rare types of SCD, such as the following:\nHbSD, HbSE, and HbSO\nPeople who have these forms of SCD inherit one hemoglobin \u201cS\u201d gene and one gene that codes for another abnormal type of hemoglobin (\u201cD\u201d, \u201cE\u201d, or \u201cO\u201d). The severity of these rarer types of SCD varies.\n\nSickle Cell Trait (SCT)\nHbAS\nPeople who have sickle cell trait (SCT) inherit a hemoglobin \u201cS\u201d gene from one parent and a normal gene (one that codes for hemoglobin \u201cA\u201d) from the other parent. People with SCT usually do not have any of the signs of the disease. However, in rare cases, a person with SCT may develop health problems; this occurs most often when there are other stresses on the body, such as when a person becomes dehydrated or exercises strenuously. Additionally, people who have SCT can pass the abnormal hemoglobin \u201cS\u201d gene on to their children.\nCause of SCD\nSCD is a genetic condition that is present at birth. It is inherited when a child receives two genes\u2014one from each parent\u2014that code for abnormal hemoglobin.\n\nDiagnosis\nSCD is diagnosed with a simple blood test. In children born in the United States, it most often is found at birth during routine newborn screening tests at the hospital. In addition, SCD can be diagnosed while the baby is in the womb. Diagnostic tests before the baby is born, such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis, can check for chromosomal or genetic abnormalities in the baby. Chorionic villus sampling tests a tiny piece of the placenta, called chorionic villus. Amniocentesis tests a small sample of amniotic fluid surrounding the baby.\n\nBecause children with SCD are at an increased risk of infection and other health problems, early diagnosis and treatment are important.\nComplications\nPeople with SCD may start to have signs of the disease during the first year of life, usually around 5 months of age. Symptoms and complications of SCD are different for each person and can range from mild to severe. Learn about the complications.\nPrevention and Treatment of SCD Complications\nGeneral Prevention Strategies\n\nManagement of SCD is focused on preventing and treating pain episodes and other complications. Prevention strategies include lifestyle behaviors as well as medical screening and interventions to prevent SCD complications.\n\nLifestyle Behaviors\n\nThere are simple steps that people with SCD can take to help prevent and reduce the occurrence of pain crises, including the following:\n\nDrink plenty of water.\nTry not to get too hot or too cold.\nTry to avoid places or situations that cause exposure to high altitudes (for example, flying, mountain climbing, or cities with a high altitude).\nTry to avoid places or situations with exposure to low oxygen levels (for example, mountain climbing or exercising extremely hard, such as in military boot camp or when training for an athletic competition).\nSimple steps to prevent harmful infections include the following:\n\nWash your hands often. Washing hands with soap and clean water many times each day is one of the best ways people with SCD, their family members, and other caregivers can help prevent an infection.\nPrepare food safely. Bacteria can be especially harmful to children with SCD.\nMedical Screenings & Interventions to Prevent SCD Complications\n\nPrevention of Infections\n\nVaccines can protect against harmful infections. It is important that children with SCD get all regular childhood vaccines. Similarly, it is important for children and adults to get the flu vaccine every year, as well as the pneumococcal vaccine and any others recommended by a doctor.\nPenicillin greatly reduces the risk of infections in people with HbSS and has been shown to be even more effective when it is started earlier. To decrease the risk of infection, it\u2019s important that young children with HbSS take penicillin (or other antibiotic prescribed by a doctor) every day until at least 5 years of age. Penicillin on a daily basis is usually not prescribed for children with other types of SCD unless the severity of the disease is similar to that of HbSS, such as HbS beta0-thalassemia.\nPrevention of Vision Loss\n\nYearly visits to an eye doctor to look for damage to the retina (the part of your eye that senses light and sends images to your brain) are important for people with SCD to avoid vision loss. If possible, it\u2019s best to see an eye doctor who specializes in diseases of the retina.\nIf the retina is damaged by excessive blood vessel growth, laser treatment often can prevent further vision loss.\nPrevention of Stroke\n\nChildren who are at risk for stroke can be identified using a special type of exam called transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD). If the child is found to have an abnormal TCD, a doctor might recommend frequent blood transfusions (a procedure in which new blood is put into a person\u2019s body through a small plastic tube inserted into a person\u2019s blood vessels) to help prevent a stroke.\nPeople who have frequent blood transfusions are usually watched closely because there can be serious side effects. For example, because blood contains iron, transfusions can lead to a condition called iron overload, in which too much iron builds up in the body. Iron overload can cause life-threatening damage to the liver, heart, and other organs. Therefore, it is important for people with SCD receiving regular blood transfusions to also receive treatment to reduce excess iron in the body. This type of treatment is known as iron chelation therapy.\nPrevention of Severe Anemia\n\nBlood transfusions may be used to treat severe anemia. A sudden worsening of anemia resulting from infection or enlargement of the spleen (an organ in the upper left side of the abdomen) is a common reason for a transfusion.\nAs with preventing stroke, frequent blood transfusions can cause iron overload, and iron chelation therapy may be needed to reduce excess iron in the body.\nManagement of Pain Crises\n\nWhen pain crises do occur, clinical management may include the following:\n\nIntravenous fluids (giving fluids directly into a person\u2019s vein)\nPain-reducing medicine\nHospitalization for severe pain crises\nSpecific Treatments to Prevent SCD Complications\n\nSCD is a disease that worsens over time. Treatments are available that can prevent complications and lengthen the lives of those who have this condition. These treatment options and their effects can be different for each person, depending on the symptoms and severity of their disease. It is important to understand the benefits and risks of each treatment option. Currently, the FDA has approved four treatments for SCD[1].", "full_prompt": "{Task}\nIf you cannot answer the question using the given text, respond with \"The text does not contain what you are looking for.\"\n================\n{Text Passage}\n**What is Sickle Cell Disease?**\n\nSickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. Red blood cells contain hemoglobin, a protein that carries oxygen. Healthy red blood cells are round, and they move through small blood vessels to carry oxygen to all parts of the body. In someone who has SCD, the hemoglobin is abnormal, which causes the red blood cells to become hard and sticky and look like a C-shaped farm tool called a \u201csickle.\u201d The sickle cells die early, which causes a constant shortage of red blood cells. Also, when they travel through small blood vessels, they get stuck and clog the blood flow. This can cause pain and other serious complications (health problems) such as infection, acute chest syndrome and stroke.\nTypes of SCD\nThere are several types of SCD. The specific type of SCD a person has depends on the genes they inherited from their parents. People with SCD inherit genes that contain instructions, or code, for abnormal hemoglobin.\nBelow are the most common types of SCD:\nHbSS\nPeople who have this form of SCD inherit two genes, one from each parent, that code for hemoglobin \u201cS.\u201d Hemoglobin S is an abnormal form of hemoglobin that causes the red cells to become rigid, and sickle shaped. This is commonly called sickle cell anemia and is usually the most severe form of the disease.\n\nHbSC\nPeople who have this form of SCD inherit a hemoglobin \u201cS\u201d gene from one parent and a gene for a different type of abnormal hemoglobin called \u201cC\u201d from the other parent. This is usually a milder form of SCD.\n\nInfographic: 5 Facts You Should Know About Sickle Cell Disease\nInfographic: 5 Facts You Should Know About Sickle Cell Disease\nDid you know SCD affects people from many parts of the world?\n\nHbS beta thalassemia\nPeople who have this form of SCD inherit a hemoglobin \u201cS\u201d gene from one parent and a gene for beta thalassemia, another type of hemoglobin abnormality, from the other parent. There are two types of beta thalassemia: \u201czero\u201d (HbS beta0) and \u201cplus\u201d (HbS beta+). Those with HbS beta0-thalassemia usually have a severe form of SCD. People with HbS beta+-thalassemia tend to have a milder form of SCD.\n\nThere also are a few rare types of SCD, such as the following:\nHbSD, HbSE, and HbSO\nPeople who have these forms of SCD inherit one hemoglobin \u201cS\u201d gene and one gene that codes for another abnormal type of hemoglobin (\u201cD\u201d, \u201cE\u201d, or \u201cO\u201d). The severity of these rarer types of SCD varies.\n\nSickle Cell Trait (SCT)\nHbAS\nPeople who have sickle cell trait (SCT) inherit a hemoglobin \u201cS\u201d gene from one parent and a normal gene (one that codes for hemoglobin \u201cA\u201d) from the other parent. People with SCT usually do not have any of the signs of the disease. However, in rare cases, a person with SCT may develop health problems; this occurs most often when there are other stresses on the body, such as when a person becomes dehydrated or exercises strenuously. Additionally, people who have SCT can pass the abnormal hemoglobin \u201cS\u201d gene on to their children.\nCause of SCD\nSCD is a genetic condition that is present at birth. It is inherited when a child receives two genes\u2014one from each parent\u2014that code for abnormal hemoglobin.\n\nDiagnosis\nSCD is diagnosed with a simple blood test. In children born in the United States, it most often is found at birth during routine newborn screening tests at the hospital. In addition, SCD can be diagnosed while the baby is in the womb. Diagnostic tests before the baby is born, such as chorionic villus sampling and amniocentesis, can check for chromosomal or genetic abnormalities in the baby. Chorionic villus sampling tests a tiny piece of the placenta, called chorionic villus. Amniocentesis tests a small sample of amniotic fluid surrounding the baby.\n\nBecause children with SCD are at an increased risk of infection and other health problems, early diagnosis and treatment are important.\nComplications\nPeople with SCD may start to have signs of the disease during the first year of life, usually around 5 months of age. Symptoms and complications of SCD are different for each person and can range from mild to severe. Learn about the complications.\nPrevention and Treatment of SCD Complications\nGeneral Prevention Strategies\n\nManagement of SCD is focused on preventing and treating pain episodes and other complications. Prevention strategies include lifestyle behaviors as well as medical screening and interventions to prevent SCD complications.\n\nLifestyle Behaviors\n\nThere are simple steps that people with SCD can take to help prevent and reduce the occurrence of pain crises, including the following:\n\nDrink plenty of water.\nTry not to get too hot or too cold.\nTry to avoid places or situations that cause exposure to high altitudes (for example, flying, mountain climbing, or cities with a high altitude).\nTry to avoid places or situations with exposure to low oxygen levels (for example, mountain climbing or exercising extremely hard, such as in military boot camp or when training for an athletic competition).\nSimple steps to prevent harmful infections include the following:\n\nWash your hands often. Washing hands with soap and clean water many times each day is one of the best ways people with SCD, their family members, and other caregivers can help prevent an infection.\nPrepare food safely. Bacteria can be especially harmful to children with SCD.\nMedical Screenings & Interventions to Prevent SCD Complications\n\nPrevention of Infections\n\nVaccines can protect against harmful infections. It is important that children with SCD get all regular childhood vaccines. Similarly, it is important for children and adults to get the flu vaccine every year, as well as the pneumococcal vaccine and any others recommended by a doctor.\nPenicillin greatly reduces the risk of infections in people with HbSS and has been shown to be even more effective when it is started earlier. To decrease the risk of infection, it\u2019s important that young children with HbSS take penicillin (or other antibiotic prescribed by a doctor) every day until at least 5 years of age. Penicillin on a daily basis is usually not prescribed for children with other types of SCD unless the severity of the disease is similar to that of HbSS, such as HbS beta0-thalassemia.\nPrevention of Vision Loss\n\nYearly visits to an eye doctor to look for damage to the retina (the part of your eye that senses light and sends images to your brain) are important for people with SCD to avoid vision loss. If possible, it\u2019s best to see an eye doctor who specializes in diseases of the retina.\nIf the retina is damaged by excessive blood vessel growth, laser treatment often can prevent further vision loss.\nPrevention of Stroke\n\nChildren who are at risk for stroke can be identified using a special type of exam called transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD).

Where Did CPUs Come From?\nWhen the 1970s dawned, computers were still monster machines hidden in\nair-conditioned rooms and attended to by technicians in white lab coats. One\ncomponent of a mainframe computer, as they were known, was the CPU, or\nCentral Processing Unit. This was a steel cabinet bigger than a refrigerator full\nof circuit boards crowded with transistors.\nComputers had only recently been converted from vacuum tubes to transistors\nand only the very latest machines used primitive integrated circuits where a\nfew transistors were gathered in one package. That means the CPU was a big\npile of equipment. The thought that the CPU could be reduced to a chip of\nsilicon the size of your fingernail was the stuff of science fiction.\n2. How Does a CPU Work?\nIn the '40s, mathematicians John Von Neumann, J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly came up\nwith the concept of the stored instruction digital computer. Before then, computers were\nprogrammed by rewiring their circuits to perform a certain calculation over and over. By having a\nmemory and storing a set of instructions that can be performed over and over, as well as logic to\nvary the path of instruction, execution programmable computers were possible.\nThe component of the computer that fetches the instructions and data from the memory and\ncarries out the instructions in the form of data manipulation and numerical calculations is called the\nCPU. It\u2019s central because all the memory and the input/output devices must connect to the CPU,\nso it\u2019s only natural to keep the cables short to put the CPU in the middle. It does all the instruction\nexecution and number calculations so it\u2019s called the Processing Unit.\nThe CPU has a program counter that points to the next instruction to be executed. It goes through\na cycle where it retrieves, from memory, the instructions in the program counter. It then retrieves\nthe required data from memory, performs the calculation indicated by the instruction and stores the\nresult. The program counter is incremented to point to the next instruction and the cycle starts all\nover.\n3. The First Microprocessor\nIn 1971 when the heavy iron mainframe computers still ruled, a small Silicon Valley company was\ncontracted to design an integrated circuit for a business calculator for Busicom. Instead of\nhardwired calculations like other calculator chips of the day, this one was designed as a tiny CPU\nthat could be programmed to perform almost any calculation.\nThe expensive and time-consuming work of designing a custom wired\nchip was replaced by the flexible 4004 microprocessor and the\ninstructions stored in a separate ROM (Read Only\nMemory) chip. A new calculator with entirely new\nfeatures can be created simply by programming a new\nROM chip. The company that started this revolution was\nIntel Corporation. The concept of a general purpose\nCPU chip grew up to be the microprocessor that is the heart of your powerful PC.\n4. 4 Bits Isn\u2019t Enough\nThe original 4004 microprocessor chip handled data in\nfour bit chunks. Four bits gives you sixteen possible\nnumbers, enough to handle standard decimal arithmetic\nfor a calculator. If it were only the size of the numbers\nwe calculate with, we might still be using four bit\nmicroprocessors.\nThe problem is that there is another form of calculation a stored\ninstruction computer needs to do. That is it has to figure out where in\nmemory instructions are. In other words, it has to calculate memory\nlocations to process program branch instructions or to index into tables\nof data.\nLike I said, four bits only gets you sixteen possibilities and even the 4004 needed to address 640\nbytes of memory to handle calculator functions. Modern microprocessor chips like the Intel\nPentium 4 can address 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes of memory, though the motherboard is\nlimited to less than this total. This led to the push for more bits in our microprocessors. We are now\non the fence between 32 bit microprocessors and 64 bit monsters like the AMD Athlon 64.\n5. The First Step Up, 8 Bits\nWith a total memory address space of 640 bytes, the Intel 4004 chip was\nnot the first microprocessor to be the starting point for a personal\ncomputer. In 1972, Intel delivered the 8008, a scaled up 4004. The 8008\nwas the first of many 8- bit microprocessors to fuel the home computer\nrevolution. It was limited to only 16 Kilobytes of address space, but in\nthose days no one could afford that much RAM.\nTwo years later, Intel introduced the 8080 microprocessor with 64 Kilobytes of\nmemory space and increased the rate of execution by a factor of ten over the 8008.\nAbout this time, Motorola brought out the 6800 with similar performance. The 8080\nbecame the core of serious microcomputers that led to the Intel 8088 used in the IBM\nPC, while the 6800 family headed in the direction of the Apple II personal computer.\n6. 16 Bits Enables the IBM PC\nBy the late '70s, the personal computer was bursting at the seams of the 8 bit\nmicroprocessor performance. In 1979, Intel delivered the 8088 and IBM engineers\nused it for the first PC. The combination of the new 16 bit microprocessor and the name IBM\nshifted the personal computer from a techie toy in the garage to a mainstream business tool.\nThe major advantage of the 8086 was up to 1 Megabyte of memory addressing.\nNow, large spreadsheets or large documents could be read in from the disk and\nheld in RAM memory for fast access and manipulation. These days, it\u2019s not\nuncommon to have a thousand times more than that in a single 1 Gigabyte RAM\nModule, but back in that time it put the IBM PC in the same league with minicomputers the size of\na refrigerator.\n7. Cache RAM, Catching Up With the CPU\nWe\u2019ll have to continue the march through the\nlineup of microprocessors in the next\ninstallment to make way for the first of the\nenhancements that you should understand.\nWith memory space expanding and the speed\nof microprocessor cores going ever faster,\nthere was a problem of the memory keeping\nup.\nLarge low-powered memories cannot go as fast\nas smaller higher power RAM chips. To keep\nthe fastest CPUs running full speed,\nmicroprocessor engineers started inserting a\nfew of the fast and small memories between the main large RAM and the microprocessor. The\npurpose of this smaller memory is to hold instructions that get repeatedly executed or data that is\naccessed often.\nThis smaller memory is called cache RAM and allows the microprocessor\nto execute at full speed. Naturally, the larger the cache RAM the higher\npercentage of cache hits and the microprocessor can continue running full\nspeed. When the program execution leads to instructions not in the cache,\nthen the instructions need to be fetched from the main memory and the\nmicroprocessor has to stop and wait.\n8. Cache Grows Up\nThe idea of cache RAM has grown along with the size and\ncomplexity of microprocessor chips. A high-end Pentium 4has 2\nMegabytes of cache RAM built into the chip. That\u2019s more than\ntwice the entire memory address space of the original 8088 chip\nused in the first PC and clones. Putting the cache right on the\nmicroprocessor itself removes the slowdown of the wires between\nchips.

The concept of a general purpose\nCPU chip grew up to be the microprocessor that is the heart of your powerful PC.\n4. 4 Bits Isn\u2019t Enough\nThe original 4004 microprocessor chip handled data in\nfour bit chunks. Four bits gives you sixteen possible\nnumbers, enough to handle standard decimal arithmetic\nfor a calculator. If it were only the size of the numbers\nwe calculate with, we might still be using four bit\nmicroprocessors.\nThe problem is that there is another form of calculation a stored\ninstruction computer needs to do. That is it has to figure out where in\nmemory instructions are. In other words, it has to calculate memory\nlocations to process program branch instructions or to index into tables\nof data.\nLike I said, four bits only gets you sixteen possibilities and even the 4004 needed to address 640\nbytes of memory to handle calculator functions. Modern microprocessor chips like the Intel\nPentium 4 can address 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes of memory, though the motherboard is\nlimited to less than this total. This led to the push for more bits in our microprocessors. We are now\non the fence between 32 bit microprocessors and 64 bit monsters like the AMD Athlon 64.\n5. The First Step Up, 8 Bits\nWith a total memory address space of 640 bytes, the Intel 4004 chip was\nnot the first microprocessor to be the starting point for a personal\ncomputer. In 1972, Intel delivered the 8008, a scaled up 4004. The 8008\nwas the first of many 8- bit microprocessors to fuel the home computer\nrevolution. It was limited to only 16 Kilobytes of address space, but in\nthose days no one could afford that much RAM.\nTwo years later, Intel introduced the 8080 microprocessor with 64 Kilobytes of\nmemory space and increased the rate of execution by a factor of ten over the 8008.\nAbout this time, Motorola brought out the 6800 with similar performance. The 8080\nbecame the core of serious microcomputers that led to the Intel 8088 used in the IBM\nPC, while the 6800 family headed in the direction of the Apple II personal computer.\n6. 16 Bits Enables the IBM PC\nBy the late '70s, the personal computer was bursting at the seams of the 8 bit\nmicroprocessor performance. In 1979, Intel delivered the 8088 and IBM engineers\nused it for the first PC. The combination of the new 16 bit microprocessor and the name IBM\nshifted the personal computer from a techie toy in the garage to a mainstream business tool.\nThe major advantage of the 8086 was up to 1 Megabyte of memory addressing.\nNow, large spreadsheets or large documents could be read in from the disk and\nheld in RAM memory for fast access and manipulation. These days, it\u2019s not\nuncommon to have a thousand times more than that in a single 1 Gigabyte RAM\nModule, but back in that time it put the IBM PC in the same league with minicomputers the size of\na refrigerator.\n7. Cache RAM, Catching Up With the CPU\nWe\u2019ll have to continue the march through the\nlineup of microprocessors in the next\ninstallment to make way for the first of the\nenhancements that you should understand.\nWith memory space expanding and the speed\nof microprocessor cores going ever faster,\nthere was a problem of the memory keeping\nup.\nLarge low-powered memories cannot go as fast\nas smaller higher power RAM chips. To keep\nthe fastest CPUs running full speed,\nmicroprocessor engineers started inserting a\nfew of the fast and small memories between the main large RAM and the microprocessor. The\npurpose of this smaller memory is to hold instructions that get repeatedly executed or data that is\naccessed often.\nThis smaller memory is called cache RAM and allows the microprocessor\nto execute at full speed. Naturally, the larger the cache RAM the higher\npercentage of cache hits and the microprocessor can continue running full\nspeed. When the program execution leads to instructions not in the cache,\nthen the instructions need to be fetched from the main memory and the\nmicroprocessor has to stop and wait.\n8. Cache Grows Up\nThe idea of cache RAM has grown along with the size and\ncomplexity of microprocessor chips. A high-end Pentium 4has 2\nMegabytes of cache RAM built into the chip. That\u2019s more than\ntwice the entire memory address space of the original 8088 chip\nused in the first PC and clones. Putting the cache right on the\nmicroprocessor itself removes the slowdown of the wires between\nchips. You know you are going fast when the speed of light for a\nfew inches makes a difference!]"}

It allows the transmission of diverse network protocols over an IP network infrastructure. In this blog post, we'll delve into the details of the GRE and its significance in modern networking.\n \n\n GRE acts as a tunneling protocol, encapsulating packets from one network protocol within another. By creating a virtual point-to-point link, it facilitates the transmission of data across different network domains. This enables the interconnection of disparate networks, making GRE a crucial tool for securely building virtual private networks (VPNs) and connecting remote sites.\n \n\n P2P GRE is a tunneling protocol that allows the encapsulation of various network layer protocols within IP packets. It provides a secure and reliable method of transmitting data between two points in a network. By encapsulating packets in IP headers, P2P GRE ensures data integrity and confidentiality.\n \n\n IP Security (IPsec) plays a crucial role in enhancing the security of P2P GRE tunnels. By leveraging cryptographic algorithms, IPsec provides authentication, integrity, and confidentiality of data transmitted over the network. It establishes a secure channel between two endpoints, ensuring that data remains protected from unauthorized access and tampering.\n \n\n Enhanced Network Security: P2P GRE over IP Security offers a robust security solution for organizations by providing secure communication channels across public and private networks. It allows for the establishment of secure connections between geographically dispersed locations, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive data.\n \n\n Improved Network Performance: P2P GRE over IP Security optimizes network performance by encapsulating and routing packets efficiently. It enables the transmission of data across different network topologies, reducing network congestion and enhancing overall network efficiency.\n \n\n Seamless Integration with Existing Infrastructures: One of the key advantages of P2P GRE over IP Security is its compatibility with existing network infrastructures. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing networks without the need for significant architectural changes, making it a cost-effective solution for organizations.\n \n\n Security Measures: Implementing P2P GRE over IP Security requires careful consideration of security measures. Organizations should ensure that strong encryption algorithms are utilized, proper key management practices are in place, and regular security audits are conducted to maintain the integrity of the network.\n \n\n Scalability and Performance Optimization: To ensure optimal performance, network administrators should carefully plan and configure the P2P GRE tunnels. Factors such as bandwidth allocation, traffic prioritization, and Quality of Service (QoS) settings should be taken into account to guarantee the efficient operation of the network.\n \n\n \n\n Generic Tunnelling\n Understanding P2P GRE & IPSec\n \n\n P2P GRE is a tunneling protocol that allows the encapsulation of different network protocols within an IP network. It provides a secure and efficient mechanism for transmitting data between two network endpoints. By encapsulating packets, P2P GRE ensures that information is protected from external threats and remains intact during transmission.\n \n\n IPsec, on the other hand, is a suite of protocols that provides security services at the IP layer. It offers authentication, confidentiality, and integrity to IP packets, ensuring that data remains secure even when traversing untrusted networks. IPsec can be combined with P2P GRE to create a robust and secure communication channel.\n \n\n The combination of P2P GRE and IPsec brings several benefits to network administrators and organizations. Firstly, it enables secure communication between geographically dispersed networks, allowing for seamless connectivity. Additionally, P2P GRE over IPsec provides strong encryption, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive data. It also allows for the creation of virtual private networks (VPNs), offering a secure and private network environment.\n \n\n P2P GRE over IPsec finds applications in various scenarios. One common use case is connecting branch offices of an organization securely. By establishing a P2P GRE over IPsec tunnel between different locations, organizations can create a secure network environment for their remote sites. Another use case is securely connecting cloud resources to on-premises infrastructure, enabling secure and seamless integration.\n \n\n The role of GRE:\n In GRE, packets are wrapped within other packets that use supported protocols, allowing the use of protocols not generally supported by a network. To understand this, consider the difference between a car and a ferry. On land, cars travel on roads, while ferries travel on water. Usually, cars cannot travel on water but can be loaded onto ferries. In this analogy, terrain could be compared to a network that supports specific routing protocols and vehicles to data packets. Similarly, one type of vehicle (the car) is loaded onto a different kind of vehicle (the ferry) to cross terrain it could not otherwise.\n \n\n GRE tunneling: how does it work?\n \n\n GRE tunnels encapsulate packets within other packets. Each router represents the end of the tunnel. GRE packets are exchanged directly between routers. When routers are between forwarding packets, they use headers surrounding them rather than opening the encapsulated packets. Every packet of data sent over a network has the payload and the header. The payload contains the data being sent, while the headers contain information about the source and group of the packet. Each network protocol attaches a header to each packet.\n \n\n Unlike load limits on automobile bridges, data packet sizes are limited by MTU and MSS. An MSS measurement only measures a packet\u2019s payload, not its headers. Including the headers, the MTU measures the total size of a packet. Packets that exceed MTU are fragmented to fit through the network.\n \n\n GRE configuration\n \n\n GRE Operation\n \n\n GRE is a layer three protocol, meaning it works at the IP level of the network. It enables a router to encapsulate packets of a particular protocol and send them to another router, where they are decapsulated and forwarded to their destination. This is useful for tunneling, where data must traverse multiple networks and different types of hardware.\n \n\n GRE encapsulates data in a header containing information about the source, destination, and other routing information. The GRE header is then encapsulated in an IP header containing the source and destination IP addresses. When the packet reaches the destination router, the GRE header is stripped off, and the data is sent to its destination.\n \n\n GRE over IPsec\n \n\n Understanding Multipoint GRE\n \n\n Multipoint GRE, or mGRE, is a tunneling protocol for encapsulating packets and transmitting them over an IP network. It enables virtual point-to-multipoint connections, allowing multiple endpoints to communicate simultaneously. By utilizing a single tunnel interface, mGRE simplifies network configurations and optimizes resource utilization.\n \n\n One of Multipoint GRE\u2019s standout features is its ability to transport multicast and broadcast traffic across multiple sites efficiently. It achieves this through a single tunnel interface, eliminating the need for dedicated point-to-point connections. This scalability and flexibility make mGRE an excellent choice for large-scale deployments and multicast applications.\n \n\n DMVPN, as the name suggests, is a virtual private network technology that dynamically creates VPN connections between multiple sites without needing dedicated point-to-point links. It utilizes a hub-and-spoke architecture, with the hub as the central point for all communication. Using the Next Hop Resolution Protocol (NHRP), DMVPN provides a highly scalable and flexible solution for securely interconnecting sites.\n \n\n Multipoint GRE, or mGRE, is a tunneling protocol my DMVPN uses to create point-to-multipoint connections.

The largest\n10\nsingle factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal\nmatters.\nOn an adjusted basis, operating expenses were up 5%, reflecting; first, in R&D, an increase in\ncompensation expense, primarily for Google DeepMind and Cloud; and second, in Sales and\nMarketing a slight increase year-on-year, reflecting increases in compensation expense,\nprimarily for Cloud sales.\nOperating income was $25.5 billion, up 46% on a reported basis, and our operating margin was\n32%.\nOn an adjusted basis, operating income was up 31%, and our operating margin was 33%.\nNet income was $23.7 billion, and EPS was $1.89.\nWe delivered free cash flow of $16.8 billion in the first quarter and $69.1 billion for the trailing\n12 months. We ended the quarter with $108 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nTurning to segment results, within Google Services, revenues were $70.4 billion, up 14%.\nGoogle Search & Other advertising revenues of $46.2 billion in the quarter were up 14%, led\nagain by growth in retail.\nYouTube advertising revenues of $8.1 billion, were up 21%, driven by both direct response and\nbrand advertising.\nNetwork advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 1%.\nSubscriptions, Platforms and Devices revenues were $8.7 billion, up 18%, primarily reflecting\ngrowth in YouTube subscription revenues.\nTAC was $12.9 billion, up 10%.\nGoogle Services Operating Income was $27.9 billion, up 28%, and the operating margin was\n40%.\nTurning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $9.6 billion for the quarter, up 28%,\nreflecting significant growth in GCP, with an increasing contribution from AI and strong Google\nWorkspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat.\nGoogle Cloud delivered Operating Income of $900 million and an operating margin of 9%.\nAs to our Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $495 million, benefiting from a\nmilestone payment in one of the Other Bets. The operating loss was $1 billion.\n11\nTurning to our outlook for the business, with respect to Google Services. First, within\nAdvertising, we are very pleased with the momentum of our Ads businesses. Search had\nbroad-based strength across verticals. In YouTube, we had acceleration in revenue growth\ndriven by brand and direct response.\nLooking ahead, two points to call out. First, results in our advertising business in Q1 continued\nto reflect strength in spend from APAC-based retailers, a trend that began in the second quarter\nof 2023 and continued through Q1, which means we will begin lapping that impact in the\nsecond quarter.\nSecond, the YouTube acceleration in revenue growth in Q1 reflects, in part, lapping the\nnegative year-on-year growth we experienced in the first quarter of 2023.\nTurning to Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices. We continue to deliver significant growth in\nour subscriptions business, which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line. The\nsequential quarterly decline in year-on-year revenue growth for the line in Q1, versus Q4,\nreflects, in part, the fact that we had only one week of Sunday Ticket subscription revenue in\nQ1 versus fourteen weeks in Q4.\nLooking forward, we will anniversary last year's price increase in YouTube TV starting in May.\nWith regard to Platforms, we are pleased with the performance in Play driven by an increase in\nbuyers.\nWith respect to Google Cloud, performance in Q1 reflects strong demand for our GCP\ninfrastructure and solutions, as well as the contribution from our Workspace productivity tools.\nThe growth we are seeing across Cloud is underpinned by the benefit AI provides for our\ncustomers. We continue to invest aggressively, while remaining focused on profitable growth.\nAs we look ahead, two points that will affect sequential year-on-year revenue growth\ncomparisons across Alphabet.\nFirst, Q1 results reflect the benefit of Leap Year, which contributed slightly more than one point\nto our revenue growth rate at the consolidated level in the first quarter.\nSecond, at current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind from foreign exchange in Q2 versus\nQ1.\nTurning to margins, our efforts to durably re-engineer our cost base are reflected in a 400 basis\npoint expansion of our Alphabet operating margin year-on-year, excluding the impact of\nrestructuring and severance charges in both periods.\nYou can also see the impact in the quarter-on-quarter decline in headcount in Q1, which reflects\n12\nboth actions we have taken over the past few months and a much slower pace of hiring.\nAs we have discussed previously, we are continuing to invest in top engineering and technical\ntalent, particularly in Cloud, Google DeepMind and Technical Infrastructure.\nLooking ahead, we remain focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in\norder to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the\nhigher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. We believe these efforts will enable\nus to deliver full-year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023.\nWith respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the first quarter was $12 billion, once again\ndriven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component\nfor servers, followed by data centers.\nThe significant year-on-year growth in CapEx in recent quarters reflects our confidence in the\nopportunities offered by AI across our business.\nLooking ahead, we expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the\nQ1 level, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly\nreported CapEx.\nWith regard to Other Bets, we similarly have workstreams under way to enhance overall\nreturns.\nFinally, as I trust you saw in the press release, we are very pleased to be adding a quarterly\ndividend of $.20 per share to our capital return program, as well as a new $70 billion\nauthorization in share repurchases.\nThe core of our capital allocation framework remains the same, beginning with investing\naggressively in our business as you have heard us talk about today, given the extraordinary\nopportunities ahead.

The largest\n10\nsingle factor in the year-on-year decline in G&A expenses was lower charges related to legal\nmatters.\nOn an adjusted basis, operating expenses were up 5%, reflecting; first, in R&D, an increase in\ncompensation expense, primarily for Google DeepMind and Cloud; and second, in Sales and\nMarketing a slight increase year-on-year, reflecting increases in compensation expense,\nprimarily for Cloud sales.\nOperating income was $25.5 billion, up 46% on a reported basis, and our operating margin was\n32%.\nOn an adjusted basis, operating income was up 31%, and our operating margin was 33%.\nNet income was $23.7 billion, and EPS was $1.89.\nWe delivered free cash flow of $16.8 billion in the first quarter and $69.1 billion for the trailing\n12 months. We ended the quarter with $108 billion in cash and marketable securities.\nTurning to segment results, within Google Services, revenues were $70.4 billion, up 14%.\nGoogle Search & Other advertising revenues of $46.2 billion in the quarter were up 14%, led\nagain by growth in retail.\nYouTube advertising revenues of $8.1 billion, were up 21%, driven by both direct response and\nbrand advertising.\nNetwork advertising revenues of $7.4 billion were down 1%.\nSubscriptions, Platforms and Devices revenues were $8.7 billion, up 18%, primarily reflecting\ngrowth in YouTube subscription revenues.\nTAC was $12.9 billion, up 10%.\nGoogle Services Operating Income was $27.9 billion, up 28%, and the operating margin was\n40%.\nTurning to the Google Cloud segment, revenues were $9.6 billion for the quarter, up 28%,\nreflecting significant growth in GCP, with an increasing contribution from AI and strong Google\nWorkspace growth, primarily driven by increases in average revenue per seat.\nGoogle Cloud delivered Operating Income of $900 million and an operating margin of 9%.\nAs to our Other Bets, for the first quarter, revenues were $495 million, benefiting from a\nmilestone payment in one of the Other Bets. The operating loss was $1 billion.\n11\nTurning to our outlook for the business, with respect to Google Services. First, within\nAdvertising, we are very pleased with the momentum of our Ads businesses. Search had\nbroad-based strength across verticals. In YouTube, we had acceleration in revenue growth\ndriven by brand and direct response.\nLooking ahead, two points to call out. First, results in our advertising business in Q1 continued\nto reflect strength in spend from APAC-based retailers, a trend that began in the second quarter\nof 2023 and continued through Q1, which means we will begin lapping that impact in the\nsecond quarter.\nSecond, the YouTube acceleration in revenue growth in Q1 reflects, in part, lapping the\nnegative year-on-year growth we experienced in the first quarter of 2023.\nTurning to Subscriptions, Platforms and Devices. We continue to deliver significant growth in\nour subscriptions business, which drives the majority of revenue growth in this line. The\nsequential quarterly decline in year-on-year revenue growth for the line in Q1, versus Q4,\nreflects, in part, the fact that we had only one week of Sunday Ticket subscription revenue in\nQ1 versus fourteen weeks in Q4.\nLooking forward, we will anniversary last year's price increase in YouTube TV starting in May.\nWith regard to Platforms, we are pleased with the performance in Play driven by an increase in\nbuyers.\nWith respect to Google Cloud, performance in Q1 reflects strong demand for our GCP\ninfrastructure and solutions, as well as the contribution from our Workspace productivity tools.\nThe growth we are seeing across Cloud is underpinned by the benefit AI provides for our\ncustomers. We continue to invest aggressively, while remaining focused on profitable growth.\nAs we look ahead, two points that will affect sequential year-on-year revenue growth\ncomparisons across Alphabet.\nFirst, Q1 results reflect the benefit of Leap Year, which contributed slightly more than one point\nto our revenue growth rate at the consolidated level in the first quarter.\nSecond, at current spot rates, we expect a larger headwind from foreign exchange in Q2 versus\nQ1.\nTurning to margins, our efforts to durably re-engineer our cost base are reflected in a 400 basis\npoint expansion of our Alphabet operating margin year-on-year, excluding the impact of\nrestructuring and severance charges in both periods.\nYou can also see the impact in the quarter-on-quarter decline in headcount in Q1, which reflects\n12\nboth actions we have taken over the past few months and a much slower pace of hiring.\nAs we have discussed previously, we are continuing to invest in top engineering and technical\ntalent, particularly in Cloud, Google DeepMind and Technical Infrastructure.\nLooking ahead, we remain focused on our efforts to moderate the pace of expense growth in\norder to create capacity for the increases in depreciation and expenses associated with the\nhigher levels of investment in our technical infrastructure. We believe these efforts will enable\nus to deliver full-year 2024 Alphabet operating margin expansion relative to 2023.\nWith respect to CapEx, our reported CapEx in the first quarter was $12 billion, once again\ndriven overwhelmingly by investment in our technical infrastructure, with the largest component\nfor servers, followed by data centers.\nThe significant year-on-year growth in CapEx in recent quarters reflects our confidence in the\nopportunities offered by AI across our business.\nLooking ahead, we expect quarterly CapEx throughout the year to be roughly at or above the\nQ1 level, keeping in mind that the timing of cash payments can cause variability in quarterly\nreported CapEx.\nWith regard to Other Bets, we similarly have workstreams under way to enhance overall\nreturns.\nFinally, as I trust you saw in the press release, we are very pleased to be adding a quarterly\ndividend of $.20 per share to our capital return program, as well as a new $70 billion\nauthorization in share repurchases.\nThe core of our capital allocation framework remains the same, beginning with investing\naggressively in our business as you have heard us talk about today, given the extraordinary\nopportunities ahead. We view the introduction of the dividend as further strengthening our\noverall capital return program.\nThank you. Sundar, Philipp and I will now take your questions."}

The system then lets users access that data and understand what happened at each touchpoint. Through this understanding, a complete customer profile is developed, and a solid customer relationship is built.\n\nCustomer data can also be aggregated to populate incentive compensation modelling, sales forecasting, territory segmentation, campaign design, product innovation, and other sales, marketing, and customer service activities.

However, over time, these solutions have extended their reach and become integral to marketing, ecommerce, and customer service functions.\n\nThe power of customer relationship management is derived by constantly gathering customer data, analysing that data, and then using those insights to deepen relationships and improve business results. It allows any customer-facing employee to convey, \"We know you, and we value you.\"\n\nA set of data-driven CRM tools supports you beyond the sales process, which is crucial to business performance. With the in-depth knowledge of your customers, you can:\n\nOffer and sell new, add-on products\u2014at the right time in the right way at the right price\nHelp customer service teams resolve issues faster\nHelp development teams create better products and services\nCRM: What is the goal?\nCRM software supports strong, productive, loyal customer relationships through informed and superior customer experiences. The goal? To improve customer acquisition and retention by providing experiences that keep your customers coming back. Customer relationship management is both a strategy and a tool that supports those experiences in five key ways.\n\n1\nAnswer the most basic customer questions\nCustomer relationship management helps you find new customers, sell to them, and develop a loyal customer relationship with them. These systems collect many different types of customer data and organize it so you understand your customers/prospects better and can answer (or even anticipate) their questions.\n\n2\nManage customer data\nBad decisions come from a lack of access to and inability to interpret customer data. Being able to store, track, and validate customer data within an automated system will allow sales and marketing teams to optimize customer engagement strategies and build better relationships.\n\n3\nAutomate the sales process\nSales force automation makes selling more efficient, helping you sell more quickly. The best CRM systems use artificial intelligence (AI) and unified customer data to automate the sales process by prompting sellers with recommended next-best actions.\n\n4\nPersonalize marketing campaigns\nCustomers and potential customers arrive through various channels, including websites, social media, email, online/offline events, etc. Unfortunately, many businesses struggle to connect marketing efforts across all these channels. Marketing teams can improve conversions, strengthen customer relationships, and align messaging across their digital customer channels by leveraging CRM systems.\n\n5\nAlign sales and marketing\nWith customer relationship management, marketing and sales work better together to drive sales and increase revenue. When sales and marketing are in sync, sales productivity goes up along with marketing ROI.\n\nCRM features and benefits\nCustomer relationship management solutions are one of the largest and fastest-growing enterprise application software categories. The CRM market size was valued at $41.93 billion in 2019 and is projected to reach $96.39 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 11.1% from 2020 to 2027.\n\nMore and more companies are using CRM solutions to acquire more sales leads, improve the sales pipeline, boost productivity, and improve customer satisfaction. However, many have encountered problems ranging from cost overruns and CRM integration challenges to system limitations. These are avoidable problems, and you can help ensure success by focusing on a customer-first strategy.\n\nIt's critical for businesses to have integrated, customizable, and comprehensive views into their customers\u2019 and potential customers\u2019 solution/product interests, customer service needs, and purchase history. A good CRM system should provide that view. All data is in a single location, viewable through optimized dashboards.\n\nAdditionally, your marketing team can leverage CRM solutions to orchestrate personalized marketing and lead generation campaigns. These systems can help track all cross-channel interactions\u2014from engagement to purchase. Mature cloud CRM solutions do more.

Still, many businesses leverage these systems simply as a sales force automation tool. But these solutions, such as Oracle's, offer many more valuable capabilities that span a wide range of marketing and sales functions, including marketing, customer service, sales, and partner channel management.\n\nToday\u2019s CRM software can support the entire customer journey. But what one company may need from a CRM system can be vastly different from what another company might require. To help you select the right CRM for your organization, it\u2019s helpful to know that there are three main types of CRM solutions: collaborative, operational, and analytical.\n\nCRM and data\nData is the most critical part of any CRM software solution. In fact, customer data is the starting point for all marketing and sales activities. Successful customer engagement and relationship strategies hinge on accurate, complete, and accessible customer profiles. Bad data comes from several places, including:\n\nFraudulently entered data\nKeystroke errors\nDuplicate customer information\nNatural changes (company bankruptcy, job changes)\nIncomplete and inaccurate data can increase quickly to degrade the value of your CRM tools, resulting in unnecessary expenses. Conversely, when customer data is complete and accurate, businesses stand a better chance of reaching their target customers and prospects. In short, your data is a valuable asset. So it\u2019s important to focus on collecting and optimizing these four CRM data types:\n\nIdentity data\nIdentity data includes descriptive details to identify customers, leads, and contacts. This data should be used for marketing segmentation.\n\nDescriptive data\nDescriptive data includes lifestyle details relevant to your contacts. It is what completes that all-important 360-degree view of leads and contacts.\n\nQuantitative data\nQuantitative data includes measurable data points that can help you interpret how your leads and contacts have interacted with you.\n\nQualitative data\nQualitative data can help you better understand your contacts\u2019 intent, including search behaviours related to buying decisions.\n\nCRM vs. marketing automation\nBoth CRM and marketing automation systems are data-driven. They focus on gathering, storing, and using data. For example, marketing automation systems gather leads by communicating with potential and current customers.\n\nSpecifically, marketing automation looks to gather enough customer data points to show intent and then hands that person off to the sales team as a marketing-qualified lead (MQL). A CRM solution picks up where the marketing automation solution left off and works to convert those marketing-qualified leads into contacts.\n\nAI in CRM\n\nDiscover the next generation of CRM (0:38)\nThe best CRM systems offer robust analytics coupled with AI and machine learning. AI is the future of customer relationship management, going beyond contact management and sales force automation to truly helping you sell.\n\nAI in CRM can guide you toward the next-best actions and provide smart talking points\u2014specific to each customer opportunity. AI also delivers timely customer intelligence that helps you optimize customer experience (CX) across marketing, sales, and customer service.\n\nCRM vs. CX\nWhen customer relationship management first arrived on the scene, businesses would capture data but not know what to do with it. Today, CRM systems are integrated with AI, which helps interpret and predict what that data means.\n\nCRM AI capabilities are the foundation to using a 360-degree view of the customer that will start them on their way to becoming your customer. As these AI enhancements continue to evolve, CX will continue to improve\u2014and in turn, customer expectations will continue to increase.\n\nYour business needs to fully understand your customers (and how they buy) to not only meet their expectations but to provide them with compelling experiences. This is the future of CX and should serve as your guide to selecting the best CRM solution.\n\nHow CRM improves customer experience\nA complete customer view is necessary for business success and growth.

INTRODUCTION\n\u201cThe hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax!\u201d \u2013 Albert Einstein\n\nTaxes are complicated. The U.S. federal tax code contains over three million words \u2013\nabout 6,000 pages. A casual browsing of the tax code\u2019s table of contents offers a glimpse\ninto the vast complexity of federal taxation. Entire sections of the tax code apply\nspecifically to the taxation of vaccines (Sec. 4131-4132), shipowners' mutual protection\nand indemnity associations (Sec. 526), specially sweetened natural wines (Sec. 5385),\nand life insurance companies (Sec. 801-818). Annual changes to the tax code imply that\ntaxes will continue to become more complex even as politicians tout tax simplification.\nTaxes levied by other jurisdictions, such as states and cities, add further complexity to\ntaxation in the U.S. Americans spend billions of hours each year working on their taxes,\nnot to mention the costs of accountants and tax preparers.\nFortunately, one needn\u2019t comprehend the imposing complexity of the tax code to\nunderstand the crucial role of taxes in American society. Taxation is an important, but\ncommonly neglected, topic for students of economics, political science, and other\ndisciplines. Tax policy has important economic consequences, both for the national\neconomy and for particular groups within the economy. Tax policies are often designed\nwith the intention of stimulating economic growth \u2013 although economists differ\ndrastically about which policies are most effective at fostering growth. Taxes can create\nincentives promoting desirable behavior and disincentives for unwanted behavior.\nTaxation provides a means to redistribute economic resources towards those with low\nincomes or special needs. Taxes provide the revenue needed for critical public services\nsuch as social security, health care, national defense, and education.\nTaxation is as much of a political issue as an economic issue. Political leaders have used\ntax policy to promote their agendas by initiating various tax reforms: decreasing (or\nincreasing) tax rates, changing the definition of taxable income, creating new taxes on\nspecific products, etc. Of course, no one particularly wants to pay taxes. Specific\ngroups, such as small-business owners, farmers, or retired individuals, exert significant\npolitical effort to reduce their share of the tax burden. The voluminous tax code is\npacked with rules that benefit a certain group of taxpayers while inevitably shifting more\nof the burden to others. Tax policy clearly reflects the expression of power in the U.S. \u2013\nthose without power or favor are left paying more in taxes while others reap the benefits\nof lower taxes because of their political influence. Broad attempts to reform the tax\nsystem have produced dramatic and sudden shifts in tax policy, generally motivated by\npolitical factors rather than sound economic theory. For example, the top marginal\nfederal tax bracket on individual income in the U.S. dropped precipitously from 70% to\n28% during the 1980s. Tax policy has clearly been used to promote political, as well as\neconomic, agendas.\nThis module is intended to provide a basic understanding of the economic, political, and\nsocial context of the entire U.S. tax system. When most people think about taxes, they\n1\n\n\ftend to think only of the federal income tax. However, looking solely at the federal\nincome tax would miss several important issues. Perhaps most importantly, the federal\nincome tax is not the largest tax bill to most Americans. We\u2019ll see that the largest tax for\nmost Americans is federal social insurance taxation. Also, the federal income tax is one\nof the most progressive taxes in the U.S. system. When all taxes are considered, the U.S.\ntax system is much less progressive. You may be surprised to find out how many taxes in\nthe U.S. are actually regressive \u2013 hitting low-income households at a disproportionately\nhigh rate.\nThis module is divided into three major sections. First, some basic terms will be defined\nand discussed, including tax progressivity and the differences between several types of\ntaxes. Second, a brief overview of tax history in the United States will be presented.\nThird, data on tax trends will be used to illustrate the changing nature of taxation with a\nfocus on the overall progressivity of the entire tax system.\n\nII. THE STRUCTURE OF TAXATION IN THE UNITED STATES\nTax Progressivity\nThe overall system of taxation in the United States is progressive. By a progressive tax\nsystem, we mean that the percentage of income an individual (or household) pays in taxes\ntends to increase with increasing income. Not only do those with higher incomes pay\nmore in total taxes, they pay a higher rate of taxes. This is the essence of a progressive\ntax system. For example, a person making $100,000 in a year might pay 25% of their\nincome in taxes ($25,000 in taxes), while someone with an income of $30,000 might only\npay a 10% tax rate ($3,000 in taxes).\nA tax system may also be regressive or proportional. A regressive tax system is one\nwhere the proportion of income paid in taxes tends to decrease as one\u2019s income increases.\nA proportional tax system simply means that everyone pays the same tax rate regardless\nof income. A particular tax system may display elements of more than one approach.\nConsider a hypothetical tax system where one pays a proportional, or flat 1 , rate on\nincome below a certain dollar amount and then progressively increasing rates above that\ndollar amount. Also, within an overall tax system, some particular taxes might be\nprogressive while other taxes are regressive. We\u2019ll see later on that this the case in the\nUnited States.\nThe Reasons for Progressive Taxation\nThe overall tax system of the United States, and in most other countries, is progressive\nfor a number of reasons. A progressive tax embodies the concept that those with high\nincomes should pay more of their income in taxes because of their greater ability to pay\n1\n\nThis is not exactly the same concept embodied in current proposals for a \u201cflat tax\u201d in the U.S. These\nproposals would set just one tax rate but would exclude a given amount of income from taxation. Thus, the\nflat tax proposals would retain a small degree of progressivity.\n\n2\n\n\fwithout critical sacrifices. By paying a tax, any household must forego an equivalent\namount of spending on goods, services, or investments. For a high-income household,\nthese foregone opportunities might include a second home, an expensive vehicle, or a\npurchase of corporate stock. A low-income household, by comparison, might have to\nforego basic medical care, post-secondary education, or vehicle safety repairs. As\nincome increases, the opportunity costs of paying taxes tend to be associated more with\nluxuries rather than basic necessities. The ability-to-pay principle recognizes that a flat\n(or regressive) tax rate would impose a larger burden, in terms of foregone necessities, on\nlow-income households as compared to high-income households.\nA progressive tax system is also a mechanism to addresses economic inequalities in a\nsociety. To evaluate a tax system\u2019s impact on inequality, one must consider both the\ndistribution of taxes paid and the distribution of the benefits derived from tax revenue. If\nthe benefits of programs funded by taxation primarily benefit low-income households\nwhile high-income households pay the majority of taxes, then the tax system effectively\noperates as a transfer mechanism. Increasing the progressivity of the tax system or\naltering the distribution of benefits allows greater redistribution of economic resources.\nWe\u2019ll mainly focus on tax payments in this module but you should also be aware that the\nbenefits of public expenditures are not evenly distributed throughout society. 2\nThere is also an economic argument for a progressive tax system \u2013 it may yield a given\nlevel of public revenue with the least economic impact. To see why, consider how\nhouseholds with different levels of income would respond to a $100 tax cut. A lowincome household would tend to quickly spend the entire amount on needed goods and\nservices \u2013 injecting $100 of increased demand into the economy. By comparison, a highincome household might only spend a fraction on goods and services, choosing to save or\ninvest a portion of the money. The money that a high-income household saves or invests\ndoes not add to the overall level of effective demand in an economy. 3 In economic\nterms, we say that the marginal propensity to consume tends to decrease as income\nincreases. So, by collecting proportionally more taxes from high-income households we\ntend to maintain a higher level of effective demand and more economic activity.\nOf course, one can posit that a tax system can become too progressive. Extremely high\ntax rates at high-income levels might create a significant disincentive that reduces the\nproductive capacity of society. Very high taxes might limit the risks taken by\nentrepreneurs, stifling innovations and technological advances. The desire to \u201csoak the\nrich\u201d through an extremely progressive tax system might be viewed as unfair, and not just\nby the rich. In fact, this was a concern of the Constitutional framers \u2013 that a democratic\nmajority would eventually impose unduly burdensome taxes on the wealthy minority.\nWe\u2019ll see that their concerns have proved groundless. Many critics of the current tax\n2\n\nThe distribution of the benefits derived from public expenditures is, of course, more difficult to determine\nthat the distribution of tax payments. The distribution of public assistance programs can be easily\nmeasured. However, the distribution of the benefits of scientific research support, business subsidies,\npublic works, national defense, and other expenditures is a difficult research task.\n3\nMoney saved or invested may, however, provide the financial capital necessary to increase the productive\ncapacity of the economy. \u201cSupply-side\u201d economists stress the importance of investment by the wealthy as\nthe key to economic growth.\n\n3\n\n\fsystem point to the contrary position \u2013 that the powerful minority have used their might\nto shift the tax burden away from themselves onto an immobilized and misinformed\nmajority.\nEven if one could devise a tax system that is economically optimal (i.e., producing the\nhighest overall level of economic growth), the topic of taxation encompasses ideals about\nequity and fairness. A society may be willing to sacrifice some degree of economic\ngrowth in exchange for a more equitable distribution of economic resources. This is not\nto say that economic growth must always be sacrificed with redistribution. In fact,\nanalysis of the U.S. historical data finds that high levels of economic growth tend to be\nassociated with periods of relatively equitable distribution of economic resources\n(Krugman, 2002).\nWe now turn to differentiating between the different types of taxes levied in the U.S.\nWe\u2019ll first discuss several forms of federal taxation, roughly in order of the revenue they\ngenerate, and then consider taxation at the state and local levels. A final section will\nconsider taxes that are generally not used in the U.S. but are important in other nations.\nFederal Income Taxes\nThe federal income tax is the most visible, complicated, and debated tax in the U.S. The\nfederal income tax was established with the ratification of the 16th Amendment to the\nU.S. Constitution in 1913. It is levied on wages and salaries as well as income from\nmany other sources including interest, dividends, capital gains, self-employment income,\nalimony, and prizes. To understand the basic workings of federal income taxes, you need\nto comprehend only two major issues. First, all income is not taxable \u2013 there are\nimportant differences between \u201ctotal income,\u201d \u201cadjusted gross income,\u201d and \u201ctaxable\nincome.\u201d Second, you need to know the distinction between a person\u2019s \u201ceffective tax\nrate\u201d and \u201cmarginal tax rate.\u201d\nTotal income is simply the sum of income an individual or couple 4 receives from all\nsources. For most people, the largest portion of total income comes from wages or\nsalaries. Many people also receive investment income from the three standard sources:\ninterest, capital gains, and dividends. Self-employment income is also included in total\nincome, along with other types of income such as alimony, farm income, and gambling\nwinnings.\nThe amount of federal taxes a person owes is not calculated based on total income.\nInstead, once total income is calculated, tax filers are allowed to subtract some expenses\nas non-taxable. To obtain adjusted gross income (AGI), certain out-of-pocket expenses\nmade by a tax filer are subtracted from total income. These expenses include individual\nretirement account contributions, allowable moving expenses, student loan interest,\ntuition, and a few other expenses. AGI is important because much of the tax data\npresented by the IRS are sorted by AGI.\n4\n\nMarried couples have the option of filing their federal taxes either jointly or separately. Children aged 14\nor over with sufficient income ($7,700 in 2002) have to file their own federal income tax returns.\n\n4\n\n\fHowever, taxes are not calculated based on AGI either. Taxable income is basically\nAGI less deductions and exemptions. Deductions are either standard or itemized. The\nstandard deduction is a fixed amount excluded from taxation \u2013 for the 2009 tax year the\nstandard deduction was $5,700 for single individuals and $11,400 for married couples.\nTax filers have the option of itemizing their deductions. To itemize, a tax filer adds up\ncertain expenses made during the year including state taxes, real estate taxes, mortgage\ninterest, gifts to charity, and major medical expenses. 5 If the itemized deductions\nexceed the standard deduction, then the itemized total is deducted instead. Exemptions\nare calculated based on the number of tax filers and dependents. A single tax filer with\nno dependent children can claim one exemption. A married couple with no children can\nclaim two exemptions. Each dependent child counts as one more exemption. Additional\nexemptions are given for being age 65 or over or blind. In 2009, each exemption\nexcluded a further $3,650 from taxation. 6\nTaxable income is obtained by subtracting the deduction and exemption amounts from\nAGI. This is the amount a taxpayer actually pays taxes on. However, the amount of tax\nowed is not simply a multiple of taxable income and a single tax rate. The federal\nincome tax system in the U.S. uses increasing marginal tax rates. This means that\ndifferent tax rates apply on different portions of a person\u2019s income. The concept is best\nillustrated with an example using the 2009 tax rates. For a single filer, the first $8,350 of\ntaxable income (not total income or AGI) is taxed at a rate of 10%. Taxable income\nabove $8,350 but less than $33,950 is taxed at a rate of 15%. Taxable income above\n$33,950 but less than $82,250 is taxed at a rate of 25%. Income above $82,250 is taxed\nat higher marginal rates \u2013 28%, 33%, and 35%.\nConsider how we would calculate the taxes due for a single tax filer (let\u2019s call her Susan)\nwith no children and a total income of $35,000. Assume Susan contributed $3,000 to an\nindividual retirement account and that this is her only allowable adjustment expense.\nThus, her AGI is $32,000. She claims one exemption (herself) in the amount of $3,650\nand the standard deduction of $5,700. Thus, Susan\u2019s taxable income is $22,650. On the\nfirst $8,350 of taxable income she owes 10% in taxes, or $835. The tax rate on the rest of\nher income is 15% for a tax of $2,145, (($22,650 - $8,350) \u00d7 0.15). So, her total federal\nincome tax bill is $2,980, ($835 + $2,145). Note that Susan\u2019s taxable income is $12,350\nless than her total income.\nWhile Susan paid a maximum tax rate of 15%, we can see that her effective tax rate is\nmuch lower. An effective tax rate can be calculated based on total income, AGI, or\ntaxable income. Suppose we wish to calculate Susan\u2019s effective tax rate based on her\ntotal income of $35,000. Given that her federal income tax is $2,980, her effective tax\nrate is only 8.5%, (($2,980/$35,000) \u00d7 100). If we based her effective tax rate on her\nAGI, it would be 9.3%, (($2,980/$32,000) \u00d7 100).\n\n5\n\nNote that some expenses, such as moving costs, are subtracted from total income to obtain AGI while\nother expenses, such as mortgage interest, are classified as deductions from AGI to obtain taxable income.\n6\nThose with high incomes (more than $125,100 for an individual) either have their exemption allowance\neither reduced or eliminated.\n\n5\n\n\fSocial Insurance Taxes\nTaxes for federal social insurance programs, including Social Security, Medicaid, and\nMedicare, are taxed separately from income. Social insurance taxes are levied on\nsalaries and wages, as well as income from self-employment. For those employed by\nothers, these taxes are generally deducted directly from their paycheck. These deductions\ncommonly appear as \u201cFICA\u201d taxes \u2013 a reference to the Federal Insurance Contributions\nAct. Self-employed individuals must pay their social insurance taxes when they file their\nfederal income tax returns.\nSocial insurance taxes are actually two separate taxes. The first is a tax of 12.4% of\nwages, which is primarily used to fund Social Security. Half of this tax is deducted from\nan employee\u2019s paycheck while the employer is responsible for matching this contribution.\nThe other is a tax of 2.9% for the Medicare program. Again, the employee and employer\neach pay half. Thus, social insurance taxes normally amount to a 7.65% deduction from\nan employee\u2019s wage (6.2% + 1.45%). Self-employed individuals are responsible for\npaying the entire share, 15.3%, themselves.\nThere is a very important difference between these two taxes. The Social Security tax is\ndue only on the first $106,800 (in 2009) of income. On income above $106,800, no\nadditional Social Security tax is paid. In other words, the maximum Social Security tax\nin 2009 that would be deducted from total wages is $6,622 ($106,800 \u00d7 0.062). The\nMedicare tax, however, is paid on all wages. Thus, the Medicare tax is truly a flat tax\nwhile the Social Security tax is a flat tax on the first $106,800 of income but then\nbecomes a regressive tax when we consider income above this limit.\nConsider the impact of social insurance taxes on two individuals, one making a typical\nsalary of $45,000 and another making $300,000. The typical worker would pay 7.65%\non all income, or $3,443, in federal social insurance taxes. The high-income worker\nwould pay the maximum Social Security contribution of $6,622 plus $4,350 for Medicare\n(1.45% of $300,000) for a total bill of $10,972. This works out to a 3.7% overall tax rate,\nor less than half the tax rate paid by the typical worker. As the high-income individual\npays a lower rate of taxation, we see that social insurance taxes are regressive.\nFederal Corporate Taxes\nCorporations must file federal tax forms that are in many ways similar to the forms\nindividuals complete. Corporate taxable income is defined as total revenues minus the\ncost of goods sold, wages and salaries, depreciation, repairs, interest paid, and other\ndeductions. Thus corporations, like individuals, can take advantage of many deductions\nto reduce their taxable income. In fact, a corporation may have so many deductions that\nit actually ends up paying no tax at all or even receives a rebate check from the federal\ngovernment. We\u2019ll discuss this issue further later in the module.\nCorporate tax rates, like personal income tax rates, are progressive and calculated on a\nmarginal basis. In 2009, the lowest corporate tax rate, applied to profits lower than\n\n6\n\n\f$50,000 was 15%. The highest marginal corporate tax rate, applied to profits between\n$100,000 and $335,000 was 39%. 7 As with individuals, the effective tax rate\ncorporations pay is lower than their marginal tax rate.\nFederal Excise Taxes\nAn excise tax is a tax on the production, sale, or use of a particular commodity. The\nfederal government collects excise taxes from manufacturers and retailers for the\nproduction or sale of a surprising number of products including tires, telephone services,\nair travel, transportation fuels, alcohol, tobacco, and firearms.\nUnlike a sales tax, which is evident as an addition to the selling price of a product, excise\ntaxes are normally incorporated into the price of a product. In most cases, consumers are\nnot directly aware of the federal excise taxes they pay. However, every time you buy\ngas, make a phone call, fly in a commercial plane, or buy tobacco products, you are\npaying a federal excise tax. For example, the federal excise tax on gasoline as of 2009\nwas about 18 cents per gallon.\nFederal excise taxes are another example of a regressive tax. Lower-income households\ntend to spend a greater portion of their income on goods that are subject to federal excise\ntaxes. This is particularly true for gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol products.\nFederal Estate and Gift Taxes\nThe vast majority of Americans will never be affected by the federal estate or gift taxes.\nThese taxes apply only to the wealthiest Americans. The estate tax is applied to transfers\nof large estates to beneficiaries. Similar to the federal income tax, there is an exemption\namount that is not taxed. Only estates valued above the exemption amount are subject to\nthe estate tax, and the tax only applies to the value of the estate above the exemption. For\nexample, if the tax rate were 45% of the exemption amount was $2 million, then the tax\non an estate valued at $3.5 million would be $675,000, ((3,500,000-2,000,000)*0.45).\nAs of Fall 2010, the future of the estate tax is in limbo. Under the Economic Growth and\nTax Relief Act of 2001, estate taxes rates were gradually reduced, and exemption rates\ngradually increased, over the period 2001-2009. In 2001, the exemption amount was\n$675,000 million and the tax rate was 55%. For the 2009 tax year, the exemption amount\nwas $3.5 million and the tax rate was 45%. But for 2010, there is no estate tax at all!\nThen, in 2011, the tax is scheduled to be reinstated with an exemption of $1 million and a\ntax rate of 55%. The ongoing debate over the estate tax will be covered in more detail\nlater in this module.\nThe transfer of large gifts is also subject to federal taxation. The estate tax and gift tax\nare complementary because the gift tax essentially prevents people from giving away\ntheir estate to beneficiaries tax-free while they are still alive. In 2009, gifts under\n7\n\nFor the highest profit bracket \u2013 profits above $18,333,333 \u2013 the marginal rate was 35%.\n\n7\n\n\f$13,000 were excluded from the tax. Similar to the federal income tax, the gift tax rates\nare marginal and progressive, with a maximum tax rate of 45%.\nThe estate and gift taxes are the most progressive element of federal taxation. The estate\ntax is paid exclusively by those with considerable assets. Even further, the majority of all\nestate taxes are paid by a very small number of wealthy taxpayers. According to the Tax\nPolicy Center, in 2009 the richest 0.1% of those subject to the estate tax pay 42% of the\ntotal estate tax revenue. (Tax Policy Center, 2010).\nState and Local Taxes\nLike the federal government, state governments also rely on tax revenues to fund public\nexpenditures and transfer programs. Like the federal government, state governments rely\non several different tax mechanisms including income taxes, excise taxes, and corporate\ntaxes. Thus, much of the above discussion applies to the tax structures in place in most\nstates. However, there are some important differences that deserve mention.\nFirst, nearly all states (45 as of 2010) have instituted some type of general sales tax.\nState sales tax rates range from 2.9% (Colorado) to 8.25% (California 8 ). A few states\nreduce the tax rate on certain goods considered to be necessities, such as food and\nprescription drugs. For example, the general sales tax in Illinois is 6.25% but most food\nand drug sales are taxed at only 1%. Other states with sales taxes exempt some\nnecessities from taxation entirely. In most states, localities can charge a separate sales\ntax. While local sales taxes are generally lower than state sales taxes, there are\nexceptions. In New York the state sales tax is 4% but local sales taxes are often higher\nthan 4%.\nUnlike income taxes, sales taxes tend to be quite regressive. The reason is that lowincome households tend to spend a larger share of their income on taxable items than\nhigh-income households. Consider gasoline \u2013 an item that tends to be a smaller share of\ntotal expenditures as income rises. An increase in the state taxes on gasoline impacts\nlow-income households more than high-income households. Some states, such as Idaho\nand Kansas, offer low-income households a tax credit to compensate for the regressive\nnature of state sales taxes.\nForty-one states levy an income tax. 9 Most of these states have several progressive tax\nbrackets (up to 12 rates) similar to the federal income tax. However, state income taxes\ntend to be much less progressive than the federal income tax. Six states have only one\nincome tax rate, meaning that their income tax approaches a flat tax. Several more states\napproach a flat tax because the top rate applies at a low income or the rates are relatively\nconstant. For example, Maine\u2019s two tax rates are 6.50% and 6.85%.\n\n8\n\nLocal sales taxes are also levied in some municipalities in California, which can raise the total sales tax to\nas high as 10.75%.\n9\nTwo other states, Tennessee and New Hampshire, levy no state income tax but do tax dividends and\ninterest.\n\n8\n\n\fAnother important distinction between the federal system of taxation and the taxes levied\nat state and local levels is use of property taxes. In fact, property taxes tend to be the\nlargest revenue source for state and local governments. The primary property tax levied\nin the U.S. is a tax on real estate, including land, private residences, and commercial\nproperties. Generally, the tax is an annual assessment calculated as a proportion of the\nvalue of the property, although the formulas used by localities differ significantly.\nProperty taxes are commonly collected at a local level, but a share of property taxes is\nallocated for state purposes. Property taxes tend to be regressive, although less regressive\nthan excise and sales taxes. The reason is that high-income households tend to have a\nlower proportion of their assets subjected to property taxes. While renters do not directly\npay property taxes, most economists conclude that the costs of property taxes are largely\npassed on to renters in the form of higher rents.\nComposition of Tax Collections in the U.S.\nTable 1 presents government tax receipts, by tax source, for 2008 (the most recent year\nfor which complete data were available). The table shows that federal taxes dominate the\nnation\u2019s tax system with nearly 65% of all receipts. The largest federal tax is the income\ntax, followed closely by social insurance taxes. State and local tax systems are primarily\ndependent on sales, income, and property taxation. The data in Table 1 cover the major\ntaxes utilized in the United States. To gain a broader perspective on taxation, see Box 1\nfor a summary of tax mechanisms that are major revenue sources for some countries but\nare currently non-existent or insignificant in the U.S.\nTable 1. 2008 U.S. Tax Receipts, by Source\nSource\nFederal Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nSocial Insurance Taxes\nCorporate Taxes\nExcise Taxes\nEstate Taxes\nTotal, Federal Taxes\nState Taxes\nSales Taxes\nProperty Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nCorporate Taxes\nExcise and Other Taxes\nTotal, State Taxes\nTotal, All Taxes\n\nAmount (Millions $)\n\nPercent of All Taxes\n\n1,145,700\n900,200\n304,300\n67,300\n23,000\n2,440,500\n\n30.4%\n23.9%\n8.1%\n1.8%\n0.6%\n64.7%\n\n304,400\n409,700\n304,600\n57,800\n253,900\n1,330,400\n3,770,900\n\n8.1%\n10.9%\n8.1%\n1.5%\n6.7%\n35.3%\n100.0%\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau (2010), except for federal estate tax data from Tax Policy Center\n(2008).\n\n9\n\n\fBOX 1. TAX ALTERNATIVES\nIt is worthwhile to briefly consider tax types that are not currently important in the U.S.\nbecause these mechanisms are used in other countries or are central in various proposals\nto reform the U.S. tax system. We summarize five tax types here:\n1. National sales tax. This would function similar to a state sales tax \u2013 as an\naddition to the retail price of certain products. A national sales tax would clearly\nbe simpler and cheaper to administer than the current federal income tax. It would\nalso encourage savings because, under most proposals, income that is not spent on\ntaxable goods and services is not taxed. There are, however, two significant\ndisadvantages to a national sales tax. First, it would create an incentive for black\nmarket exchanges to evade the tax. Second, it can be highly regressive \u2013 similar\nto the regressivity of state sales taxes. A national sales tax could be made less\nregressive, or even progressive, by providing rebates for low-income households.\n2. National consumption tax. This is slightly different from a national sales tax. A\nhousehold would pay the tax at the end of the year based on the value of its annual\nconsumption of goods and services. Consumption can be calculated as total\nincome less money not spent on goods and services (i.e., invested or saved).\nAgain, a consumption tax would promote savings by exempting it from taxation.\nA consumption tax could also be designed to be progressive by taxing different\nlevels of consumption at different marginal rates.\n3. Value added tax. Most developed countries levy some form of value added tax\n(VAT). A VAT is levied at each stage in the production process of a product,\ncollected from manufacturers according to the value added at each stage. Thus,\nthe tax is not added to the retail price but incorporated into prices, similar to the\nway excise taxes become embedded into the price of products. Compared to a\nnational sales tax, a VAT reduces the likelihood of black markets.\n4. Wealth taxes. While the U.S. tax system includes local property taxes and, at\nleast for a while, estate taxes, there is no tax on holdings of other assets such as\ncorporate stocks, bonds, and personal property. Several European countries,\nincluding Sweden, Spain, and Switzerland, have instituted an annual wealth tax.\nA wealth tax could be very progressive by setting high rates and becoming\neffective only at significant wealth levels.\n5. Environmental taxes. These are levied on goods and services in proportion to\ntheir environmental impact. One example is a carbon tax, which taxes products\nbased on the emissions of carbon attributable to their production or consumption.\nThe rationale of environmental taxation is that it encourages the use and\ndevelopment of goods and services with reduced environmental impacts. Like\nother taxes on goods and services, environmental taxes can be regressive \u2013\nsuggesting that environmental taxes need to be combined with other progressive\ntaxes or rebates for low-income households. Among developed countries, the U.S.\ncollects the smallest share of tax revenues from environmental taxes (OECD,\n2010).\n\n10\n\n\fIII. A BRIEF HISTORY OF TAXATION IN THE U.S. 10\nBefore the Federal Income Tax\nThe tax mechanisms used during first 150 years or so of U.S. tax history bears little\nresemblance to the current system of taxation. First, the U.S. Constitution restricted\n\u201cdirect\u201d taxation by the federal government \u2013 meaning taxes directly on individuals.\nInstead, the federal government relied on indirect taxes including taxes on imports\n(tariffs) and excise taxes. Tariffs were the major source of U.S. government receipts\nfrom the beginning of the nation up to the early 1900\u2019s. For example, in 1800 custom\nduties comprised about 84% of government receipts (U.S. Census Bureau, 1960).\nInternal federal revenue collections (which exclude tariffs on imports) as recently as the\nearly 20th century were primarily derived from excise taxes on alcohol. In 1900 over\n60% of internal revenue collections came from alcohol excise taxes with another 20%\nfrom tobacco excise taxes.\nAnother important difference is the scale of government taxation and expenditures\nrelative to the entire economy. Government spending is currently a major portion of the\ntotal U.S. economy \u2013 in 2010 government expenditures and investment at all levels\ncomprised about 20% of total economic output. In the late 1800s government\nexpenditures were responsible for only about 2% of national output (earlier data on\nnational output are not available). The role of government has become more prominent\nas a result of expansion of military activity and an increase in the provision of public\nservices. Consequently an overall trend of increasing taxation is evident, although we\u2019ll\nsee that this trend has recently stabilized or reversed.\nThe Constitutional framers were wary of a government\u2019s power to tax. Taxation of the\nAmerican Colonies by a distant and corrupt England was a driving force behind the\nAmerican Revolution. Consequently, they believed in decentralized taxation and\ndelegated most public revenue collection to localities, which relied primarily on property\ntaxes. During peacetime the federal government was able to meet its expenses through\nrelatively modest excise taxes and tariffs. During times of war, such as the War of 1812,\nfederal taxes were temporarily raised to finance the war or pay down the ensuing debts.\nOnce the financial crisis passed, taxes were reduced in response to public opposition to\nhigh tax rates.\nLike previous wars, the Civil War initiated an increase in both excise tax and tariff rates.\nGovernment revenue collections increased by a factor of seven between 1863 and 1866.\nPerhaps the most significant tax policy enacted during the Civil War was the institution\nof the first national income tax. Concerns about the legality of the tax, considering the\nConstitution\u2019s prohibition of direct taxation, were muted during the national emergency.\nThe income tax rates were low by modern standards \u2013 a maximum rate of 10% along\nwith generous exemptions meant that only about 10% of households were subject to any\nincome tax. Still, the income tax generated over 20% of federal revenues in 1865. After\n10\n\nThe history of taxation is primarily derived from Brownlee (1996).\n\n11\n\n\fthe war, few politicians favored the continuation of the income tax, and in 1872 it was\nallowed to expire.\nThe impetus for the modern federal income tax rests not with a wartime emergency but\nwith the Populist movement of the late 1800s. The internal tax system in place at the\ntime, based primarily on excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco, was largely regressive.\nThe Populists revived interest in an income tax as a means to introduce a progressive tax\nbased on ability to pay. They saw it as a response to excessive monopoly profits and the\nconcentration of wealth and power. In other words, the tax was not envisioned as a\nmeans to generate significant additional public revenue but as a vehicle of social justice.\nA federal income tax, with a large exemption of $4,000, was instituted in 1894 but the\nSupreme Court ruled it unconstitutional in 1895. Over the next couple of decades\nproposals were made for a constitutional amendment to establish a federal income tax.\nWhile these attempts were defeated, support for federal income taxation gradually\nincreased. Eventually, in 1913 the 16th Amendment was ratified creating the legal basis\nfor the federal income tax.\nWhile the initial income tax was progressive, it was less radical than many desired. In\nfact, many conservatives expressed guarded support for the measure to prevent a more\nsignificant tax. While the income tax was targeted towards the wealthy \u2013 in the first few\nyears only about 2% of households paid any income tax \u2013 tax rates of only 1%-7%\nprevented it from generating significant revenues.\n\u201c...virtually none of the income tax proponents within the government believed\nthat the income tax would become a major, yet alone the dominant, permanent\nsource of revenue within the consumption-based federal tax system.\u201d (Brownlee,\n1996, p. 45)\nThese views were to quickly change as the nation required a dramatic increase in\nrevenues to finance World War I.\nThe Growth of Direct Taxation\nRather than relying on increases in excise taxes and tariffs to finance World War I, the\nadministration of Woodrow Wilson transformed the income tax framework laid down\njust a few years previously. Desiring both to raise additional revenue and enforce social\njustice, the top marginal rate increased dramatically from 7% in 1915 to 67% in 1917\n(IRS, 2002). Corporate taxes also became an important revenue source, accounting for\nover one-quarter of internal revenue collections in 1917. In 1916 the estate tax was\ncreated, not necessarily to generate large revenues but as another instrument of\nprogressive taxation.\nUnlike previous wars, much of the tax system laid down during World War I remained in\nplace after the war. In the period from 1910 to 1925 tariffs fell from about half of\ngovernment receipts to less than 15%. Meanwhile the new corporate and individual\n\n12\n\n\fincome taxes made up nearly half of government receipts in the mid 1920s. The level of\nexcise tax collections dropped significantly, especially during the years of Prohibition\nwhen alcohol excise taxes virtually disappeared.\nThe Great Depression, of course, caused a significant decline in federal receipts. In 1932\ntax rates were increased in an attempt to boost federal revenue. Franklin Roosevelt, in\nthe years leading up to World War II, presented progressive taxation as a key element of\nthe New Deal. However, the most significant measure enacted during this period was the\ncreation of old-age insurance.\nPrior to national social insurance programs, poverty was the common state of the elderly\n(Skidmore, 1999). By the 1930s, several European countries had already instituted\nprograms of social insurance. Germany was the first to establish old-age and survivors\npensions in 1889 (Peterson, 1999). The Great Depression finally motivated policy\nmakers in the U.S. to enact similar legislation. Rather than funding Social Security\nprograms through increases in income, or other, taxes, the funding mechanism was a\nseparate tax, split equally between employers and employees. All employees covered by\nthe system 11 contributed and received benefits regardless of their income. This design\nwas intended to protect the system from political attack. As everyone who pays into the\nsystem receives benefits, Social Security is not considered \u201cwelfare\u201d that is allocated to\nonly a segment of the population. Also, because Social Security is a separate tax,\ncontributors view their old-age payments as entitlements and oppose attempts to weaken\nthe program. This design has so far proved very successful \u2013 Social Security is often\ncalled the \u201cthird rail\u201d of American politics (i.e., touch it and you die).\nWorld War II created yet another emergency situation requiring additional revenues.\nSimilar to Woodrow Wilson during World War I, President Franklin Roosevelt sought to\nraise revenues primarily from higher taxes on corporations and high-income households.\nRoosevelt went so far as to state that:\n\u201cIn this time of grave national danger, when all excess income should go to win\nthe war, no American citizen ought to have a net income, after he has paid his\ntaxes, of more than $25,000.\u201d (Brownlee, 1996, p. 91)\nRoosevelt was unable to obtain enough Congressional support to enact his most\nprogressive proposals. The ensuing compromise did produce a more progressive federal\nincome tax but it also became levied on more households. Personal exemptions were\nreduced by half between 1939 and 1942 \u2013 meaning the income tax reached well into the\nmiddle class for the first time. The taxable income subject to the highest marginal rate\ndropped from $5 million in 1941 down to $200,000 in 1942. Also, the top marginal tax\nrate reached a record high of 94% in 1944. Another change during World War II was\nwithholding federal taxes from an employee\u2019s paycheck rather than requiring payment of\n\n11\n\nWhile Social Security has expanded over the years to cover more employees, all workers are not\ncurrently covered by the system. For example, about one-quarter of state and local government employees\nare not included in the system (Peterson, 1999).\n\n13\n\n\ftaxes due at the end of the year. These, as well as other, changes produced a dramatic\nshift in the structure of federal taxation:\n\u201cUnder the new tax system, the number of individual taxpayers grew from 3.9\nmillion in 1939 to 42.6 million in 1945, and federal income tax collections over\nthe period leaped from $2.2 billion to $35.1 billion. By the end of the war nearly\n90 percent of the members of the labor force submitted income-tax returns, and\nabout 60 percent of the labor force paid income taxes. \u2026 At the same time, the\nfederal government came to dominate the nation\u2019s revenue system. In 1940,\nfederal income tax had accounted for only 16 percent of the taxes collected by all\nlevels of government; by 1950 the federal income tax produced more than 51\npercent of all collections. Installation of the new regime was the most dramatic\nshift in the nation\u2019s tax policies since 1916.\u201d (Brownlee, 1996, p. 96-97)\nAs in the period after World War I, much of the new tax structure instituted during World\nWar II remained in place after the war. Both major political parties expressed support for\na progressive but broad income tax, relatively flat tax rates on corporate profits, and\nsocial insurance taxes that were basically regressive. Public support for the existing tax\nsystem was boosted by patriotic feelings and broad-based economic growth after the war.\nChanges to the tax system between the end of World War II and the 1980\u2019s were\ngenerally minor. The Social Security tax occasionally increased as more people were\nreceiving benefits. The initial tax rate of 2% (1% each for employers and employees) had\nincreased to 6.13% by 1979. The Medicare and Medicaid programs were established in\nthe 1960s. Across-the-board tax cuts in 1964 reduced marginal rates for both low- and\nhigh-income households (the top marginal rate fell from 91% in 1963 to 70% in 1965).\nStill, government continued to become a more significant portion of the entire economy\nin the decades after World War II. Total government expenditure and investment\nincreased gradually from less than 18% of GDP in 1946 to over 22% by the mid 1970s.\nFrom the \u201cReagan Revolution\u201d to the Bush Tax Cuts\nThe general stasis of the federal tax system ended in the 1980s with the passage of\nseveral important tax reforms. Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980 on a\nplatform of smaller government and lower taxes. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of\n1981 (ERTA) enacted the largest tax cut in American history 12 and inspired tax cutting\nby many other nations in the 1980s. The supply-side rationale behind ERTA\u2019s sharp\nreduction in tax rates, particularly on high-income households and capital, was that\ngreater incentives would motivate increased investment and economic activity. The\nensuing economic growth and consequent tax revenue growth would, in theory, more\nthan offset the revenue reductions as a result of the tax cuts. Thus, the theory was that tax\ncuts could actually produce an increase in federal revenues and address the growing\nfederal budget deficit as well. ERTA phased in a reduction in the top tax rate from 70%\nto 50%, enacted several corporate tax cuts, and indexed many tax parameters to inflation\n(such as personal exemptions and deductions).\n12\n\nWhen measured in constant dollars (adjusted for inflation).\n\n14\n\n\fAnalysis suggests that, in reality, ERTA resulted in the largest reduction in federal\nrevenues of any tax bill since World War II (Tempalski, 1998). The federal budget\ndeficit continued to grow. The very next year, in 1982, the largest peacetime tax increase\nwas passed (Martin, 1991). The act repealed some of the more revenue-reducing\nprovisions of ERTA, such as accelerated depreciation reductions for corporations, and\nclosed several corporate loopholes in the tax code. Social Security reforms were enacted\nin 1983 that increased Social Security tax rates and initiated taxation of some benefits.\nReagan continued to push for further tax reforms, leading to the Tax Reform Act of 1986\n\u2013 considered to be the most comprehensive revision of the tax code since the 1950s\n(Petska and Strudler, 1999). This act reduced top income tax rates even further \u2013 from\n50% in 1986 to 28% in 1988. Among many other changes, it also lowered the top\ncorporate tax rate from 46% to 34%.\nClearly, the \u201cReagan revolution\u201d is an important era in U.S. tax history, but many people\nmisinterpret it as a period where the size of the federal government was drastically\nreduced and taxes cut significantly. Despite the two major tax cuts during Reagan\u2019s\nterms, federal revenue collections increased at nearly the same pace as national output\n(total federal revenues increased about 76% from 1980-1988 while GDP increased 83%).\nThe actual changes were more evident in the distribution of federal revenues than their\ntotal level. The share of revenues from both individual and corporate taxation fell (by 9%\nand 16% respectively) while the portion from social insurance taxes increased by 38%.\nAs the individual and corporate taxes are progressive, while social insurance taxes are\nregressive, the outcome was a decrease in the overall progressivity of the federal tax\nsystem. Specific changes within the individual income tax code exacerbated the decline\nin progressivity.\nThe Reagan era failed to control the growing federal deficit. The annual budget deficits\nof the federal government tripled during the 1980s 13 (OMB, 2003). Partly to raise\nadditional revenue to try to reduce deficits, the first President Bush reneged on his\ncampaign promise of \u201cno new taxes\u201d and agreed to a compromise tax proposal in 1990\nthat raised the top marginal tax bracket to 31%. President Clinton reinstated additional\nprogressivity in 1993 by creating the 36% and 39.6% individual tax brackets. In 1993,\nthe corporate tax rate was increased slightly to 35%. These changes produced an increase\nin the progressivity of federal taxes.\nThe most recent important tax legislation was the $1.35 trillion Bush tax cut passed in\n2001. The major provisions of this act include lowering individual income tax rates\nacross-the-board, scheduling repeal of the estate tax in 2010, and increasing the amount\nemployees can contribute under various programs for retirement purposes. Many of the\nbill\u2019s provisions are \u201cback-loaded,\u201d meaning the tax reductions are phased in over time\nwith most of the tax reduction occurring in the future. For example, the top marginal\nbracket fell from 39.6% in 2001 to 38.6% in 2002 but eventually fell to 35.0% in 2006.\n\n13\n\nThis is based on the \u201con-budget\u201d calculations. The on-budget accounting excludes the Social Security\ntrust fund as well as other minor balances.\n\n15\n\n\fThe Bush tax cut reduced the overall progressiveness of the federal income tax as highincome taxpayers received a disproportionate share of the total cuts (CTJ, 2001).\nA somewhat smaller tax cut was passed in 2003 that, among other changes, accelerated\nscheduled tax rate decreases and lowered the maximum tax rate on capital gains and\ndividends. Most recently, the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\ninstituted or expanded various tax credits such as a payroll tax credit of $400 per worker\nand an expanded tax credit for college tuition.\n\nIV. Summary Data of U.S. Tax History\nUntil quite recently, tax collections have tended to increase over time; paralleling the\nincrease in the size of the federal government. We see in Figure 1 that federal tax\nrevenues have grown considerably during the 20th century, even after adjusting for\ninflation. A large increase in federal tax collections occurred during World War II, with\nrelatively consistent growth after about 1960. However, notice occasional declines in\nfederal tax revenues, due either to recessions or to major tax code changes. The growth\nFigure 1. Tax Collections, 1913-2009 (All values in 2009 dollars) 14\n\n14\n\nData on state and local taxes are incomplete and/or inconsistent prior to 1932. All data from various\neditions of the Statistical Abstract of the United States and U.S. Census Bureau (1960).\n\n16\n\n\fof state and local tax collections, by comparison, has been steadier with less fluctuation.\nThe reason is that state and local tax revenues are derived primarily from property and\nsales taxes, which vary less than income (particularly corporate income) during business\ncycles.\nAnother way to illustrate the growth of federal taxation is to measure it relative to\nnational economic output. In Figure 2 we plot federal and state and local tax collections\nas a share of GDP. Three facts are evident from Figure 2. First, total tax collections have\ngenerally grown as a percentage of GDP over the 20th century. Again, the largest leap\noccurred during World War II, but some additional growth is evident after the war as\nwell. The second fact is that federal tax revenues now substantially exceed state and\nlocal tax revenues. While World War II solidified the federal government as the primary\ntax collector in the U.S., note that this trend began prior to the war. Finally, note the\ndecline in federal taxes as a percentage of GDP since 2000. This is a result of both\neconomic recessions and declines in federal tax rates. In fact, federal taxes as a\npercentage of GDP were lower in 2009 than in any year since the 1940s.\nFigure 2. Tax Collections as a Percentage of GDP, 1913-2009 15\n\nAs federal revenues grew during the 20th century, the composition of taxation has\nchanged considerably. We see in Figure 3 that at the beginning of the century federal\ntaxation was dominated by excise taxes. Except for a revival of excise taxes during the\nDepression Era, their importance has generally diminished over time. Corporate taxes\nbecame the most significant source of federal revenues for the period 1918-1932. After a\nperiod of higher corporate taxes during World War II, corporate taxes have generally\ndiminished in significance relative to other forms of federal taxation. Personal income\n15\n\nData on state and local taxes are incomplete and/or inconsistent prior to 1932.\n\n17\n\n\ftaxes became the largest source of federal revenues in 1944 and have remained so. Since\nWorld War II, income taxes have consistently supplied between 40-50% of federal\nrevenues. Since about 1950, social insurance taxes have increased their share of federal\nrevenues from about 10% up to nearly 40%. In fact, social insurance taxes may soon\nexceed personal income taxes as the largest source of federal revenues.\n\nFigure 3. Composition of Federal Taxes, 1913-2009\n\nThe composition of state and local taxes, with its increased reliance on sales and property\ntaxes, differs from the composition of federal taxes. Of course, each state has a different\ntax system \u2013 some states have no income and/or sales taxes, and tax rates can differ\nsignificantly across states. In this module, we combine tax data for all states rather than\npresenting a state-by-state analysis. Figure 4 presents the composition of state and local\ntaxes over the period 1945-2009. The two major trends that are evident are a decline in\nthe importance of property taxes and an increase in the importance of personal income\ntaxes except for a recent reversal of these trends in the last few years. While property\ntaxes were the primary source of state and local revenues until the 1970s, sales taxes\nbecame the major source of revenues until 2008, when property taxes again became the\nmajor revenue source.\n\n18\n\n\fFigure 4. Composition of State and Local Taxation, 1945-2009\n\nV. THE DISTRIBUTION OF TAXES IN THE UNITED STATES\nTax Incidence Analysis\nThere are basically two ways to analyze how the tax burden is distributed. The easiest\nway is to measure the taxes directly paid by entities, such as households or businesses,\nclassified according to criteria such as household income, business profit levels, etc.\nThese data can be obtained directly from aggregate tax return data published by the IRS\nand from reports from other government agencies. This approach considers only who\nactually pays the tax to the government. Thus, it would allocate corporate taxes to\ncorporations, excise taxes to manufacturers, sales taxes to consumers, etc.\nThe second approach, called tax incidence analysis, is more complex yet more\nmeaningful. While taxes are paid by various entities other than individuals, such as\ncorporations, partnerships, and public service organizations, the burden of all taxes\nultimately fall on people. The final incidence of taxation is contingent upon how a\nspecific tax translates into changes in prices and changes in economic behavior among\nconsumers and businesses:\n\u201cTax incidence is the study of who bears the economic burden of a tax. More\ngenerally, it is the positive analysis of the impact of taxes on the distribution of\nwelfare within a society. It begins with the very basic insight that the person who\n\n19\n\n\fhas the legal obligation to make a tax payment may not be the person whose\nwelfare is reduced by the existence of the tax. The statutory incidence of a tax\nrefers to the distribution of those legal tax payments \u2013 based on the statutory\nobligation to remit taxes to the government. ...\nEconomic incidence differs from statutory incidence because of changes in\nbehavior and consequent changes in equilibrium prices. Consumers buy less of a\ntaxed product, so firms produce less and buy fewer inputs \u2013 which changes the net\nprice or return to each input. Thus the job of the incidence analyst is to determine\nhow those other prices change, and how those price changes affect different\ngroups of individuals.\u201d (Metcalf and Fullerton, 2002, p. 1)\nTax incidence analysis has produced a number of generally accepted conclusions\nregarding the burden of different tax mechanisms. Remember, for example, that the\npayroll tax on paper is split equally between employer and employee:\n\u201cSo, who really pays the payroll tax? Is the payroll tax reflected in reduced\nprofits for the employer or in reduced wages for the worker? ... there is generally\nuniversal agreement that the real burden of the tax falls almost entirely on the\nworker. Basically, an employer will only hire a worker if the cost to the employer\nof hiring that worker is no more than the value that worker can add. So, a worker\nis paid roughly what he or she adds to the value of production, minus the payroll\ntax; in effect, the whole tax is deducted from wages. ... to repeat, this is not a\ncontroversial view; it is the view of the vast majority of analysts...\u201d (Krugman,\n2001, p. 43)\nThe most common assumption made regarding the allocation of corporate taxes is that\nthe burden of these taxes falls almost exclusively on the owners of capital investments.\nGiven the mobility of capital, the burden is not limited to owners of corporate capital but\nextends to owners of all capital. 16 This result is primarily a theoretical finding \u2013 in reality\nsome portion of the corporate tax burden likely falls on workers (through lower wages)\nand consumers (through higher prices).\nExcise taxes, although directly paid by manufacturers, are generally attributed entirely to\nconsumers according to their consumption patterns. 17 This result is based on an\nassumption of perfect competition in the affected industries. Real-world markets,\nhowever, are not perfectly competitive. The actual incidence of excise taxes will depend\non the degree of competition in an industry. For example, imperfectly competitive\nindustries with upward-sloping supply curves imply that prices increase by less than the\ntax and that a portion of excise taxes is borne by businesses. 18\n\n16\n\nSee summary in Metcalf and Fullerton (2002).\nSee CBO (2008).\n18\nSee Fullerton and Metcalf (2002) for a summary of incidence assumptions and analyses for different\ntypes of taxes.\n17\n\n20\n\n\fThe burden of sales taxes is generally assumed to fall directly on consumers who buy the\ntaxed goods and services. Again, this is a simplifying assumption \u2013 in reality some\nportion of sales taxes filters to corporate owners, other capital owners, and workers.\nPersonal income taxes paid by households are directly attributed to those households\npaying the tax. Estate tax burdens fall on the heirs paying the tax. Finally, property tax\nburdens are generally assumed to fall on property owners although the burden can be\npassed on renters (some analysts attribute property taxes more broadly to owners of\ncapital).\nSo, for several types of tax mechanisms (personal income, sales, excise, and estate taxes),\ndata on direct tax payments is analogous to tax incidence. However, for other taxes\n(payroll, corporate, and to a lesser extent property taxes) the direct data on tax payments\nwill differ from the ultimate burden of the tax.\nUsing Effective Tax Rate Data to Determine Tax Progressivity\nAs mentioned before, a tax is progressive if the percentage of income a person pays for\nthe tax increases as income increases. Thus, we can determine whether a tax is\nprogressive or regressive by looking at a table showing the effective tax rates for a\nparticular tax for people in different income categories. If effective tax rates increase\n(decrease) with increasing income, then the tax is progressive (regressive). Table 2\nshows the percentage of income people in each adjusted gross income (AGI) category\npaid in federal income taxes in 2008, the most recent data available. We see that\neffective tax rates for the federal income tax tend to increase with increasing income\n(although not always). For taxpayers making less than $100,000 AGI per year, the\nTable 2. Distribution of Federal Income Taxes, 2008\n\nAGI Category\n\nPercent of\nReturns\n16.7\n\nAverage\nAGI\n$5,099\n\nAverage\nIncome Taxes\n$177\n\nEffective Income\nTax Rate\n3.5%\n\n16.0\n\n$14,927\n\n$513\n\n3.4%\n\n13.0\n\n$24,798\n\n$1,421\n\n5.7%\n\n18.0\n\n$39,126\n\n$2,808\n\n7.2%\n\n13.5\n\n$61,470\n\n$5,246\n\n8.5%\n\n8.2\n9.7\n2.4\n0.4\n\n$86,421\n$133,208\n$285,735\n$679,576\n\n$8,037\n$16,903\n$55,984\n$163,513\n\n9.3%\n12.7%\n19.6%\n24.1%\n\n0.2\n\n$3,349,101\n\n$780,550\n\n23.3%\n\n$1-$10,000\n$10,000-$20,000\n$20,000-$30,000\n$30,000-$50,000\n$50,000-$75,000\n$75,000 - $100,000\n$100,000-$200,000\n$200,000-$500,000\n$500,000$1,000,000\nMore than\n$1,000,000\n\n21\n\n\feffective federal income tax rate averages less than 10% of income. For those making\nmore than $200,000 per year, the federal income tax averages more than 20% of income.\nThe federal income tax is clearly progressive because those with higher incomes\ngenerally pay a larger share of their income for the tax. For a regressive tax, effective tax\nrates tend to decrease as income increases. If effective tax rates are constant at different\nincome levels, then a tax is proportional.\nLooking at effective tax rates by income categories can normally determine whether a tax\nis progressive or regressive. However, there may be some cases where effective tax rates\ndo not follow a consistent pattern across income levels. For example, suppose that\neffective taxes first increase but then decrease as we move up the income spectrum.\nAnother limitation with data on effective tax rates is that this approach does not tell us the\ndegree of progressivity or regressivity. We might not be able to determine whether one\ntax is more progressive than another or whether a particular tax becomes more or less\nprogressive over time.\nResearchers have come up with several tax indices that measure the progressivity of a tax\nas a single number. These indices allow direct comparisons across different tax types and\nacross time. The most common tax progressivity index is discussed in Box 2.\nEffective Tax Rates in the United States\nData on the distribution of taxes in the U.S. are available from several sources. The\ngovernment sources that publish data on tax distribution include the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS), the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), the Congressional Budget Office\n(CBO), and the Office of Tax Analysis within the U.S. Treasury. The IRS data are the\nmost detailed but focus on federal income and estate taxes. The IRS publishes data on\ncorporate taxes but does not conduct tax incidence analysis. The JCT occasionally\nconducts tax incidence analyses but only on the federal income tax, payroll taxes, and\nfederal excise taxes. The CBO adds the incidence of federal corporate taxes to their\nanalyses but still omits the federal estate tax and all state and local taxes.\nThe only source for tax incidence data for all taxes in the U.S. is Citizens for Tax Justice\n(CTJ), a non-profit organization. CTJ uses data from government sources but has\ndeveloped its own models of tax incidence. Comparison of tax progressivity data from\nCTJ with data from the federal sources listed above indicates that their results are\ngenerally similar to the government\u2019s results and not biased in either direction (Roach,\n2003).\n\n22\n\n\fBOX 2. MEASURING TAX PROGRESSIVITY \u2013 THE SUITS INDEX\nThe Suits Index, developed by Daniel Suits in the 1970s (Suits, 1977), calculates a single\nnumber that measures tax progressivity. The approach basically compares the cumulative\nshare of income received by taxpayers, order from lowest to highest, to their cumulative\nshare of taxes paid. For a progressive (regressive) tax, the share of taxes paid will tend to\nbe less (more) than the share of income as we move up the income spectrum. Other tax\nprogressivity indices have been developed but the Suits Index remains the most widely\nused approach (Anderson, et al., 2003).\nWhile the calculation details are not presented here, the Suits Index is a number ranging\nbetween \u20131 and +1. A negative Suits Index means that the tax is regressive while a\npositive index indicates a progressive tax (with a value of zero for a proportional tax).\nThe Suits Index can be used to compare the degree of progressivity of different tax types\nas well as determine whether a tax becomes more or less progressive over time.\nThe Suits Index has been used to estimate the progressivity of different tax types in the\nU.S. for 2007 (Roach, 2010). Table 2.1 shows that the U.S. tax system contains a mixture\nof progressive and regressive taxes. The federal estate tax is the most progressive tax\nwhile the federal corporate and income taxes are also progressive. On the other hand,\nfederal excise taxes are the most regressive. Federal social insurance taxes and overall\nstate and local taxes are also regressive. When all federal taxes are considered, the Suits\nIndex of +0.18 indicates that federal taxation is progressive. The entire U.S. tax system is\nalso progressive, but the recent Suits Indices of +0.05 and +0.06 are closer to a value of\nzero (a proportional tax) than just the federal tax system.\nTable 2.1.

We see that while the\nfederal tax system is progressive, the state and local tax system is, on average, regressive.\nOverall, the tax system in the U.S. is progressive, although the rate of progressivity levels\noff at upper income levels and actually reverses at the highest income level in Table 3.\nTable 3.

Most analyses are limited to one, or a few, tax types. Further,\ninterest groups can interpret the available data to support their particular agendas. For an\nillustration about how the same tax data can be used to support different claims, see Box\n3.\nAnalysis of tax progressivity over time indicates that the federal tax system is about as\nprogressive now as it was in the late 1970s (Roach, 2010). The progressivity of the\nfederal tax system declined during the early 1980s, rose in 1987 (the year following the\npassage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986), either remained stable or rose slightly up to the\nmid-200s, and decreased slightly since the mid-200s.\nComplete data on the distribution of state and local taxes are available from Citizens for\nTax Justice for 1995, 2002, 2007, and 2009, with Suits Indices of -0.11, -0.07, -0.12, and\n-0.07 respectively. Thus the available data suggest no obvious overall trend in the\nregressivity of state and local taxes. The unavailability of consistent data on the\ndistribution of state and local taxes makes determination of the trends in the overall U.S.\n\n19\n\nData from CTJ, 2010.\n\n24\n\n\ftax system difficult to determine. As Table 2.1 indicated, total taxes declined in\nprogressivity from 2001 to 2004, and then stayed about the same from 2004 to 2009.\n\nBOX 3. INTERPRETING TAX PROGRESSIVITY DATA\nHas the federal income tax burden on the very wealthy been increasing or decreasing in\nrecent decades? Data published by the CBO reveals that the percent of federal income\ntaxes paid by the highest-income taxpayers has increased steady over the past few\ndecades. In 1979, the top 1% of taxpayers paid about 18.3% of all federal income taxes.\nIn 2007, the top 1% of taxpayers paid over 39.5%. Clearly, these data suggest that the\nfederal income tax has become much more progressive since 1979.\nHowever, these statistics represent an incomplete analysis. Specifically, it fails to\nconsider how the proportion of income accruing to the top 1% has changed over the same\ntime period. The increasing tax share paid by high-income taxpayers may be a function of\nan increase in income, rather than a change in the tax system. In other words, if the share\nof all income received by the top 1% increased, we would naturally expect that their share\nof taxes paid would also increase without any changes in the underlying progressivity of\nthe tax system. Income statistics indicate that the share of income going to the top 1% of\ntaxpayers has also increased significantly since 1979. The top 1% of taxpayers received\nless than 9.2% of income in 1979 but more than 19.4% in 2007. Based on this fact alone,\nwe would expect the top 1% to be paying a greater share of all federal income taxes.\nSo, has the federal income tax burden on the top 1% increased or decreased since 1979?\nWe can combine the tax and income data for a more complete analysis. The share of\nincome going to the top 1% increased by a factor of 2.1 between 1979 and 2007.\nMeanwhile, their share of taxes paid has increased by a factor of 2.2. This suggests that\nthe share of taxes paid by the top 1% has risen by about as much as much as their share of\nincome \u2013 indicating a relatively stable degree of tax progressivity in the federal income\ntax \u2013 a dramatically different conclusion had we only considered data on tax shares!\n\n25\n\n\fReferences\nBrownlee, W.

Progressive taxation is based on\nthe view that higher-income taxpayers can pay higher tax rates without having to\nforego life\u2019s basic necessities. Progressive taxation can also redress economic\ninequalities and collect a given level of revenue while maintaining the maximum\nlevel of economic growth.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe federal income tax is the most complicated and debated tax in the U.S. tax\nsystem. The federal income tax is progressive, with increasing marginal tax rates.\nFederal income taxes are calculated based on taxable income, which is less than\ntotal income because various exemptions and deductions are allowed.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe federal tax system in the U.S. also includes social insurance, corporate,\nexcise, estate, and gifts taxes. Social insurance and excise taxes are regressive\nwhile corporate, estate, and gift taxes are progressive. The U.S. tax system also\nincludes state and local taxes, primarily sales, income, and property taxes.\n\n\u2022\n\nNearly 70% of the taxes levied in the U.S. are collected at the federal level. The\nlargest federal tax is the income tax, closely followed by social insurance taxes.\nThe most significant non-federal tax is property taxes, followed by sales and\nincome taxes.\n\n\u2022\n\nUp until the early 1900s, the U.S. tax system primarily relied on excise taxes and\ntariffs for public revenues. The 16th Amendment, ratified in 1913, created the\nlegal basis for federal income taxation, which up to that point had been prohibited\nunder the Constitution.\n\n\u2022\n\nBoth World Wars led to significant changes in the structure and overall magnitude\nof taxes in the U.S. By the end of World War II, U.S. taxes were broad-based but\nprogressive and dominated by federal-level taxation.\n\n\u2022\n\nTax cuts passed during the Reagan Administration in the 1980s were based on the\ntheory that lower tax rates would spur economic growth, leading to a net increase\nin tax revenues. This theory was not supported by the evidence, eventually\nleading to tax increases in the early 1990s. The Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 and\n2003 have made federal taxes less progressive.\n\n\u2022\n\nTax revenues in the U.S. increased dramatically during the 20th century, even after\nadjusting for inflation. When measured as a percentage of GDP, tax revenues\ngrew significantly during World War II, grew at a slower pace afterwards, and\nleveled off recently at around 30% of GDP.\n\n29\n\n\f\u2022\n\nMeasuring the distribution of taxes requires tax incidence analysis, which\ndetermines the ultimate burden of a tax on taxpayers. Tax incidence analysis\ngenerally concludes that social insurance taxes fall on workers, corporate taxes\nfall on the owners of capital, excise taxes fall on consumers, and property taxes\nare passed on to renters.\n\n\u2022\n\nEffective tax rates measured by income level can be used to determine whether a\nparticular tax is progressive or regressive. While the U.S. tax system contains\nboth progressive and regressive taxes, the overall system is progressive. Recent\ndata suggest that federal taxes are becoming less progressive while state and local\ntaxes are becoming more regressive.\n\n30\n\n\fDISCUSSION QUESTIONS\n\n1. Comment on the following statement: \u201cThe fairest type of tax system is one in\nwhich everyone pays the same rate of taxation, regardless of income.\u201d Do you\nagree or disagree with the statement? Why?\n2. Suppose you could set the overall effective tax rates across different levels of\nincome. What do you think should be the appropriate effective tax rates for a\nhousehold of four (two adults and two children) with an income of $25,000? An\nincome of $60,000? An income of $100,000? An income of $500,000? Is the\nsystem you devise more or less progressive than the tax system currently in place\nin the U.S.? How does your system compare with others in your class?\n3. The U.S. tax system is currently comprised of many different types of taxes\n(income, social insurance, corporate, sales, property, etc.). What reasons could be\ngiven to support the use of many different tax types in a nation? Do you think\nthat a nation\u2019s tax system should be comprised of many different types of taxes or\njust one type of tax? If you had to choose just one type of tax to levy in a nation,\nwhat type of tax would you choose? Why?\n4. Comment on the following statement: \u201cAs long as a tax cut reduces taxes for\neveryone, then everyone will be better off as a result of the tax cut.\u201d Do you\nagree with this statement? Why or why not?\n5. Using the Internet or other sources, look up information about basic structure of\nthe tax system in place in a country other than the United States. What\ndifferences are evident in that country\u2019s tax system? Do you think that country\nhas a more or less progressive tax system? Which nation\u2019s tax system is\npreferable to you? Why?\n6. Locate a recent news story about a proposal for a change to the tax system, either\nat the federal or state level. Summarize the proposed change. Would the change\nincrease or decrease tax progressivity? Who would benefit most from the\nproposal? Who would be hurt the most from the proposal? Do you support the\nproposal? Why or why not?\n\n31\n\n\fADDITIONAL RESOURCES\n\u2022\n\nAll the federal government agencies that work on tax issues maintain web sites that\nprovide tax data and reports. The IRS\u2019s Statistics of Income Bulletins, published four\ntimes a year, can be found dating back to 1998 at\nhttp://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=117514,00.html. The SOI Bulletins provide\ndata analysis of primarily individual and corporate taxes. Publications produced by\nthe Joint Committee on Taxation can be found at\nhttp://www.jct.gov/publications.html. Publications by the Congressional Budget\nOffice related to tax issues, going as far back as the 1970s, are available at\nhttp://www.cbo.gov/publications/bysubject.cfm?cat=33. Finally, tax analysis by the U.S.\nTreasury Department, only dating back to 2001, can be found at\nhttp://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Pages/default.aspx.\n\n\u2022\n\nA large amount of tax-related data is published annually in the Statistical Abstract of\nthe United States. Each year\u2019s edition includes a chapter on state and local\ngovernment finances and another chapter on federal government finances. The\nCensus Bureau has recently added select historical editions of the Statistical Abstract\ndating as far back as 1878, although online availability is more complete for the first\nhalf of the 20th century than the latter half of the century (see\nhttp://www.census.gov/compendia/statab).\n\n\u2022\n\nCitizens for Tax Justice publishes many other tax analyses besides those referenced in\nthis module. Their web site is www.ctj.org. Two other non-profit organizations that\nconduct tax analysis are the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute\nand Brookings Institution, and the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. The Tax\nPolicy Center (www.taxpolicycenter.org) publishes several reports each month on a\nwide range of tax issues, including distributional impacts and public budget\nimplications. The CBPP (www.cbpp.org) research focuses on \u201cfiscal policy and\npublic programs that affect low- and moderate-income families and individuals.\u201d\nSimilar to the Tax Policy Center, the CBPP conducts distributional analyses of\ncurrent tax proposals.\n\n\u2022\n\nFor an opposing view on tax issues, the Tax Foundation (www.taxfoundation.org)\npublishes tax analyses that generally support lower overall taxes and conclude that the\ndistributional impacts of recent tax cuts are fair. A similar organization, with a more\nactivist agenda, is Americans for Tax Reform (www.atr.org).\n\n32\n\n\fKEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS\nAbility-to-pay principle: the idea that higher-income households and individuals should\npay higher tax rates than lower-income taxpayers because they are more able to bear the\ntax without foregoing life\u2019s basic necessities.\nAdjusted gross income (AGI): the total income of a household or individual minus\ncertain out-of-pocket expenses such as retirement account contributions, student loan\ninterest, tuition, and other allowable subtractions.

INTRODUCTION\n\u201cThe hardest thing in the world to understand is income tax!\u201d \u2013 Albert Einstein\n\nTaxes are complicated. The U.S. federal tax code contains over three million words \u2013\nabout 6,000 pages. A casual browsing of the tax code\u2019s table of contents offers a glimpse\ninto the vast complexity of federal taxation. Entire sections of the tax code apply\nspecifically to the taxation of vaccines (Sec. 4131-4132), shipowners' mutual protection\nand indemnity associations (Sec. 526), specially sweetened natural wines (Sec. 5385),\nand life insurance companies (Sec. 801-818). Annual changes to the tax code imply that\ntaxes will continue to become more complex even as politicians tout tax simplification.\nTaxes levied by other jurisdictions, such as states and cities, add further complexity to\ntaxation in the U.S. Americans spend billions of hours each year working on their taxes,\nnot to mention the costs of accountants and tax preparers.\nFortunately, one needn\u2019t comprehend the imposing complexity of the tax code to\nunderstand the crucial role of taxes in American society. Taxation is an important, but\ncommonly neglected, topic for students of economics, political science, and other\ndisciplines. Tax policy has important economic consequences, both for the national\neconomy and for particular groups within the economy. Tax policies are often designed\nwith the intention of stimulating economic growth \u2013 although economists differ\ndrastically about which policies are most effective at fostering growth. Taxes can create\nincentives promoting desirable behavior and disincentives for unwanted behavior.\nTaxation provides a means to redistribute economic resources towards those with low\nincomes or special needs. Taxes provide the revenue needed for critical public services\nsuch as social security, health care, national defense, and education.\nTaxation is as much of a political issue as an economic issue. Political leaders have used\ntax policy to promote their agendas by initiating various tax reforms: decreasing (or\nincreasing) tax rates, changing the definition of taxable income, creating new taxes on\nspecific products, etc. Of course, no one particularly wants to pay taxes. Specific\ngroups, such as small-business owners, farmers, or retired individuals, exert significant\npolitical effort to reduce their share of the tax burden. The voluminous tax code is\npacked with rules that benefit a certain group of taxpayers while inevitably shifting more\nof the burden to others. Tax policy clearly reflects the expression of power in the U.S. \u2013\nthose without power or favor are left paying more in taxes while others reap the benefits\nof lower taxes because of their political influence. Broad attempts to reform the tax\nsystem have produced dramatic and sudden shifts in tax policy, generally motivated by\npolitical factors rather than sound economic theory. For example, the top marginal\nfederal tax bracket on individual income in the U.S. dropped precipitously from 70% to\n28% during the 1980s. Tax policy has clearly been used to promote political, as well as\neconomic, agendas.\nThis module is intended to provide a basic understanding of the economic, political, and\nsocial context of the entire U.S. tax system. When most people think about taxes, they\n1\n\n\ftend to think only of the federal income tax. However, looking solely at the federal\nincome tax would miss several important issues. Perhaps most importantly, the federal\nincome tax is not the largest tax bill to most Americans. We\u2019ll see that the largest tax for\nmost Americans is federal social insurance taxation. Also, the federal income tax is one\nof the most progressive taxes in the U.S. system. When all taxes are considered, the U.S.\ntax system is much less progressive. You may be surprised to find out how many taxes in\nthe U.S. are actually regressive \u2013 hitting low-income households at a disproportionately\nhigh rate.\nThis module is divided into three major sections. First, some basic terms will be defined\nand discussed, including tax progressivity and the differences between several types of\ntaxes. Second, a brief overview of tax history in the United States will be presented.\nThird, data on tax trends will be used to illustrate the changing nature of taxation with a\nfocus on the overall progressivity of the entire tax system.\n\nII. THE STRUCTURE OF TAXATION IN THE UNITED STATES\nTax Progressivity\nThe overall system of taxation in the United States is progressive. By a progressive tax\nsystem, we mean that the percentage of income an individual (or household) pays in taxes\ntends to increase with increasing income. Not only do those with higher incomes pay\nmore in total taxes, they pay a higher rate of taxes. This is the essence of a progressive\ntax system. For example, a person making $100,000 in a year might pay 25% of their\nincome in taxes ($25,000 in taxes), while someone with an income of $30,000 might only\npay a 10% tax rate ($3,000 in taxes).\nA tax system may also be regressive or proportional. A regressive tax system is one\nwhere the proportion of income paid in taxes tends to decrease as one\u2019s income increases.\nA proportional tax system simply means that everyone pays the same tax rate regardless\nof income. A particular tax system may display elements of more than one approach.\nConsider a hypothetical tax system where one pays a proportional, or flat 1 , rate on\nincome below a certain dollar amount and then progressively increasing rates above that\ndollar amount. Also, within an overall tax system, some particular taxes might be\nprogressive while other taxes are regressive. We\u2019ll see later on that this the case in the\nUnited States.\nThe Reasons for Progressive Taxation\nThe overall tax system of the United States, and in most other countries, is progressive\nfor a number of reasons. A progressive tax embodies the concept that those with high\nincomes should pay more of their income in taxes because of their greater ability to pay\n1\n\nThis is not exactly the same concept embodied in current proposals for a \u201cflat tax\u201d in the U.S. These\nproposals would set just one tax rate but would exclude a given amount of income from taxation. Thus, the\nflat tax proposals would retain a small degree of progressivity.\n\n2\n\n\fwithout critical sacrifices. By paying a tax, any household must forego an equivalent\namount of spending on goods, services, or investments. For a high-income household,\nthese foregone opportunities might include a second home, an expensive vehicle, or a\npurchase of corporate stock. A low-income household, by comparison, might have to\nforego basic medical care, post-secondary education, or vehicle safety repairs. As\nincome increases, the opportunity costs of paying taxes tend to be associated more with\nluxuries rather than basic necessities. The ability-to-pay principle recognizes that a flat\n(or regressive) tax rate would impose a larger burden, in terms of foregone necessities, on\nlow-income households as compared to high-income households.\nA progressive tax system is also a mechanism to addresses economic inequalities in a\nsociety. To evaluate a tax system\u2019s impact on inequality, one must consider both the\ndistribution of taxes paid and the distribution of the benefits derived from tax revenue. If\nthe benefits of programs funded by taxation primarily benefit low-income households\nwhile high-income households pay the majority of taxes, then the tax system effectively\noperates as a transfer mechanism. Increasing the progressivity of the tax system or\naltering the distribution of benefits allows greater redistribution of economic resources.\nWe\u2019ll mainly focus on tax payments in this module but you should also be aware that the\nbenefits of public expenditures are not evenly distributed throughout society. 2\nThere is also an economic argument for a progressive tax system \u2013 it may yield a given\nlevel of public revenue with the least economic impact. To see why, consider how\nhouseholds with different levels of income would respond to a $100 tax cut. A lowincome household would tend to quickly spend the entire amount on needed goods and\nservices \u2013 injecting $100 of increased demand into the economy. By comparison, a highincome household might only spend a fraction on goods and services, choosing to save or\ninvest a portion of the money. The money that a high-income household saves or invests\ndoes not add to the overall level of effective demand in an economy. 3 In economic\nterms, we say that the marginal propensity to consume tends to decrease as income\nincreases. So, by collecting proportionally more taxes from high-income households we\ntend to maintain a higher level of effective demand and more economic activity.\nOf course, one can posit that a tax system can become too progressive. Extremely high\ntax rates at high-income levels might create a significant disincentive that reduces the\nproductive capacity of society. Very high taxes might limit the risks taken by\nentrepreneurs, stifling innovations and technological advances. The desire to \u201csoak the\nrich\u201d through an extremely progressive tax system might be viewed as unfair, and not just\nby the rich. In fact, this was a concern of the Constitutional framers \u2013 that a democratic\nmajority would eventually impose unduly burdensome taxes on the wealthy minority.\nWe\u2019ll see that their concerns have proved groundless. Many critics of the current tax\n2\n\nThe distribution of the benefits derived from public expenditures is, of course, more difficult to determine\nthat the distribution of tax payments. The distribution of public assistance programs can be easily\nmeasured. However, the distribution of the benefits of scientific research support, business subsidies,\npublic works, national defense, and other expenditures is a difficult research task.\n3\nMoney saved or invested may, however, provide the financial capital necessary to increase the productive\ncapacity of the economy. \u201cSupply-side\u201d economists stress the importance of investment by the wealthy as\nthe key to economic growth.\n\n3\n\n\fsystem point to the contrary position \u2013 that the powerful minority have used their might\nto shift the tax burden away from themselves onto an immobilized and misinformed\nmajority.\nEven if one could devise a tax system that is economically optimal (i.e., producing the\nhighest overall level of economic growth), the topic of taxation encompasses ideals about\nequity and fairness. A society may be willing to sacrifice some degree of economic\ngrowth in exchange for a more equitable distribution of economic resources. This is not\nto say that economic growth must always be sacrificed with redistribution. In fact,\nanalysis of the U.S. historical data finds that high levels of economic growth tend to be\nassociated with periods of relatively equitable distribution of economic resources\n(Krugman, 2002).\nWe now turn to differentiating between the different types of taxes levied in the U.S.\nWe\u2019ll first discuss several forms of federal taxation, roughly in order of the revenue they\ngenerate, and then consider taxation at the state and local levels. A final section will\nconsider taxes that are generally not used in the U.S. but are important in other nations.\nFederal Income Taxes\nThe federal income tax is the most visible, complicated, and debated tax in the U.S. The\nfederal income tax was established with the ratification of the 16th Amendment to the\nU.S. Constitution in 1913. It is levied on wages and salaries as well as income from\nmany other sources including interest, dividends, capital gains, self-employment income,\nalimony, and prizes. To understand the basic workings of federal income taxes, you need\nto comprehend only two major issues. First, all income is not taxable \u2013 there are\nimportant differences between \u201ctotal income,\u201d \u201cadjusted gross income,\u201d and \u201ctaxable\nincome.\u201d Second, you need to know the distinction between a person\u2019s \u201ceffective tax\nrate\u201d and \u201cmarginal tax rate.\u201d\nTotal income is simply the sum of income an individual or couple 4 receives from all\nsources. For most people, the largest portion of total income comes from wages or\nsalaries. Many people also receive investment income from the three standard sources:\ninterest, capital gains, and dividends. Self-employment income is also included in total\nincome, along with other types of income such as alimony, farm income, and gambling\nwinnings.\nThe amount of federal taxes a person owes is not calculated based on total income.\nInstead, once total income is calculated, tax filers are allowed to subtract some expenses\nas non-taxable. To obtain adjusted gross income (AGI), certain out-of-pocket expenses\nmade by a tax filer are subtracted from total income. These expenses include individual\nretirement account contributions, allowable moving expenses, student loan interest,\ntuition, and a few other expenses. AGI is important because much of the tax data\npresented by the IRS are sorted by AGI.\n4\n\nMarried couples have the option of filing their federal taxes either jointly or separately. Children aged 14\nor over with sufficient income ($7,700 in 2002) have to file their own federal income tax returns.\n\n4\n\n\fHowever, taxes are not calculated based on AGI either. Taxable income is basically\nAGI less deductions and exemptions. Deductions are either standard or itemized. The\nstandard deduction is a fixed amount excluded from taxation \u2013 for the 2009 tax year the\nstandard deduction was $5,700 for single individuals and $11,400 for married couples.\nTax filers have the option of itemizing their deductions. To itemize, a tax filer adds up\ncertain expenses made during the year including state taxes, real estate taxes, mortgage\ninterest, gifts to charity, and major medical expenses. 5 If the itemized deductions\nexceed the standard deduction, then the itemized total is deducted instead. Exemptions\nare calculated based on the number of tax filers and dependents. A single tax filer with\nno dependent children can claim one exemption. A married couple with no children can\nclaim two exemptions. Each dependent child counts as one more exemption. Additional\nexemptions are given for being age 65 or over or blind. In 2009, each exemption\nexcluded a further $3,650 from taxation. 6\nTaxable income is obtained by subtracting the deduction and exemption amounts from\nAGI. This is the amount a taxpayer actually pays taxes on. However, the amount of tax\nowed is not simply a multiple of taxable income and a single tax rate. The federal\nincome tax system in the U.S. uses increasing marginal tax rates. This means that\ndifferent tax rates apply on different portions of a person\u2019s income. The concept is best\nillustrated with an example using the 2009 tax rates. For a single filer, the first $8,350 of\ntaxable income (not total income or AGI) is taxed at a rate of 10%. Taxable income\nabove $8,350 but less than $33,950 is taxed at a rate of 15%. Taxable income above\n$33,950 but less than $82,250 is taxed at a rate of 25%. Income above $82,250 is taxed\nat higher marginal rates \u2013 28%, 33%, and 35%.\nConsider how we would calculate the taxes due for a single tax filer (let\u2019s call her Susan)\nwith no children and a total income of $35,000. Assume Susan contributed $3,000 to an\nindividual retirement account and that this is her only allowable adjustment expense.\nThus, her AGI is $32,000. She claims one exemption (herself) in the amount of $3,650\nand the standard deduction of $5,700. Thus, Susan\u2019s taxable income is $22,650. On the\nfirst $8,350 of taxable income she owes 10% in taxes, or $835. The tax rate on the rest of\nher income is 15% for a tax of $2,145, (($22,650 - $8,350) \u00d7 0.15). So, her total federal\nincome tax bill is $2,980, ($835 + $2,145). Note that Susan\u2019s taxable income is $12,350\nless than her total income.\nWhile Susan paid a maximum tax rate of 15%, we can see that her effective tax rate is\nmuch lower. An effective tax rate can be calculated based on total income, AGI, or\ntaxable income. Suppose we wish to calculate Susan\u2019s effective tax rate based on her\ntotal income of $35,000. Given that her federal income tax is $2,980, her effective tax\nrate is only 8.5%, (($2,980/$35,000) \u00d7 100). If we based her effective tax rate on her\nAGI, it would be 9.3%, (($2,980/$32,000) \u00d7 100).\n\n5\n\nNote that some expenses, such as moving costs, are subtracted from total income to obtain AGI while\nother expenses, such as mortgage interest, are classified as deductions from AGI to obtain taxable income.\n6\nThose with high incomes (more than $125,100 for an individual) either have their exemption allowance\neither reduced or eliminated.\n\n5\n\n\fSocial Insurance Taxes\nTaxes for federal social insurance programs, including Social Security, Medicaid, and\nMedicare, are taxed separately from income. Social insurance taxes are levied on\nsalaries and wages, as well as income from self-employment. For those employed by\nothers, these taxes are generally deducted directly from their paycheck. These deductions\ncommonly appear as \u201cFICA\u201d taxes \u2013 a reference to the Federal Insurance Contributions\nAct. Self-employed individuals must pay their social insurance taxes when they file their\nfederal income tax returns.\nSocial insurance taxes are actually two separate taxes. The first is a tax of 12.4% of\nwages, which is primarily used to fund Social Security. Half of this tax is deducted from\nan employee\u2019s paycheck while the employer is responsible for matching this contribution.\nThe other is a tax of 2.9% for the Medicare program. Again, the employee and employer\neach pay half. Thus, social insurance taxes normally amount to a 7.65% deduction from\nan employee\u2019s wage (6.2% + 1.45%). Self-employed individuals are responsible for\npaying the entire share, 15.3%, themselves.\nThere is a very important difference between these two taxes. The Social Security tax is\ndue only on the first $106,800 (in 2009) of income. On income above $106,800, no\nadditional Social Security tax is paid. In other words, the maximum Social Security tax\nin 2009 that would be deducted from total wages is $6,622 ($106,800 \u00d7 0.062). The\nMedicare tax, however, is paid on all wages. Thus, the Medicare tax is truly a flat tax\nwhile the Social Security tax is a flat tax on the first $106,800 of income but then\nbecomes a regressive tax when we consider income above this limit.\nConsider the impact of social insurance taxes on two individuals, one making a typical\nsalary of $45,000 and another making $300,000. The typical worker would pay 7.65%\non all income, or $3,443, in federal social insurance taxes. The high-income worker\nwould pay the maximum Social Security contribution of $6,622 plus $4,350 for Medicare\n(1.45% of $300,000) for a total bill of $10,972. This works out to a 3.7% overall tax rate,\nor less than half the tax rate paid by the typical worker. As the high-income individual\npays a lower rate of taxation, we see that social insurance taxes are regressive.\nFederal Corporate Taxes\nCorporations must file federal tax forms that are in many ways similar to the forms\nindividuals complete. Corporate taxable income is defined as total revenues minus the\ncost of goods sold, wages and salaries, depreciation, repairs, interest paid, and other\ndeductions. Thus corporations, like individuals, can take advantage of many deductions\nto reduce their taxable income. In fact, a corporation may have so many deductions that\nit actually ends up paying no tax at all or even receives a rebate check from the federal\ngovernment. We\u2019ll discuss this issue further later in the module.\nCorporate tax rates, like personal income tax rates, are progressive and calculated on a\nmarginal basis. In 2009, the lowest corporate tax rate, applied to profits lower than\n\n6\n\n\f$50,000 was 15%. The highest marginal corporate tax rate, applied to profits between\n$100,000 and $335,000 was 39%. 7 As with individuals, the effective tax rate\ncorporations pay is lower than their marginal tax rate.\nFederal Excise Taxes\nAn excise tax is a tax on the production, sale, or use of a particular commodity. The\nfederal government collects excise taxes from manufacturers and retailers for the\nproduction or sale of a surprising number of products including tires, telephone services,\nair travel, transportation fuels, alcohol, tobacco, and firearms.\nUnlike a sales tax, which is evident as an addition to the selling price of a product, excise\ntaxes are normally incorporated into the price of a product. In most cases, consumers are\nnot directly aware of the federal excise taxes they pay. However, every time you buy\ngas, make a phone call, fly in a commercial plane, or buy tobacco products, you are\npaying a federal excise tax. For example, the federal excise tax on gasoline as of 2009\nwas about 18 cents per gallon.\nFederal excise taxes are another example of a regressive tax. Lower-income households\ntend to spend a greater portion of their income on goods that are subject to federal excise\ntaxes. This is particularly true for gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol products.\nFederal Estate and Gift Taxes\nThe vast majority of Americans will never be affected by the federal estate or gift taxes.\nThese taxes apply only to the wealthiest Americans. The estate tax is applied to transfers\nof large estates to beneficiaries. Similar to the federal income tax, there is an exemption\namount that is not taxed. Only estates valued above the exemption amount are subject to\nthe estate tax, and the tax only applies to the value of the estate above the exemption. For\nexample, if the tax rate were 45% of the exemption amount was $2 million, then the tax\non an estate valued at $3.5 million would be $675,000, ((3,500,000-2,000,000)*0.45).\nAs of Fall 2010, the future of the estate tax is in limbo. Under the Economic Growth and\nTax Relief Act of 2001, estate taxes rates were gradually reduced, and exemption rates\ngradually increased, over the period 2001-2009. In 2001, the exemption amount was\n$675,000 million and the tax rate was 55%. For the 2009 tax year, the exemption amount\nwas $3.5 million and the tax rate was 45%. But for 2010, there is no estate tax at all!\nThen, in 2011, the tax is scheduled to be reinstated with an exemption of $1 million and a\ntax rate of 55%. The ongoing debate over the estate tax will be covered in more detail\nlater in this module.\nThe transfer of large gifts is also subject to federal taxation. The estate tax and gift tax\nare complementary because the gift tax essentially prevents people from giving away\ntheir estate to beneficiaries tax-free while they are still alive. In 2009, gifts under\n7\n\nFor the highest profit bracket \u2013 profits above $18,333,333 \u2013 the marginal rate was 35%.\n\n7\n\n\f$13,000 were excluded from the tax. Similar to the federal income tax, the gift tax rates\nare marginal and progressive, with a maximum tax rate of 45%.\nThe estate and gift taxes are the most progressive element of federal taxation. The estate\ntax is paid exclusively by those with considerable assets. Even further, the majority of all\nestate taxes are paid by a very small number of wealthy taxpayers. According to the Tax\nPolicy Center, in 2009 the richest 0.1% of those subject to the estate tax pay 42% of the\ntotal estate tax revenue. (Tax Policy Center, 2010).\nState and Local Taxes\nLike the federal government, state governments also rely on tax revenues to fund public\nexpenditures and transfer programs. Like the federal government, state governments rely\non several different tax mechanisms including income taxes, excise taxes, and corporate\ntaxes. Thus, much of the above discussion applies to the tax structures in place in most\nstates. However, there are some important differences that deserve mention.\nFirst, nearly all states (45 as of 2010) have instituted some type of general sales tax.\nState sales tax rates range from 2.9% (Colorado) to 8.25% (California 8 ). A few states\nreduce the tax rate on certain goods considered to be necessities, such as food and\nprescription drugs. For example, the general sales tax in Illinois is 6.25% but most food\nand drug sales are taxed at only 1%. Other states with sales taxes exempt some\nnecessities from taxation entirely. In most states, localities can charge a separate sales\ntax. While local sales taxes are generally lower than state sales taxes, there are\nexceptions. In New York the state sales tax is 4% but local sales taxes are often higher\nthan 4%.\nUnlike income taxes, sales taxes tend to be quite regressive. The reason is that lowincome households tend to spend a larger share of their income on taxable items than\nhigh-income households. Consider gasoline \u2013 an item that tends to be a smaller share of\ntotal expenditures as income rises. An increase in the state taxes on gasoline impacts\nlow-income households more than high-income households. Some states, such as Idaho\nand Kansas, offer low-income households a tax credit to compensate for the regressive\nnature of state sales taxes.\nForty-one states levy an income tax. 9 Most of these states have several progressive tax\nbrackets (up to 12 rates) similar to the federal income tax. However, state income taxes\ntend to be much less progressive than the federal income tax. Six states have only one\nincome tax rate, meaning that their income tax approaches a flat tax. Several more states\napproach a flat tax because the top rate applies at a low income or the rates are relatively\nconstant. For example, Maine\u2019s two tax rates are 6.50% and 6.85%.\n\n8\n\nLocal sales taxes are also levied in some municipalities in California, which can raise the total sales tax to\nas high as 10.75%.\n9\nTwo other states, Tennessee and New Hampshire, levy no state income tax but do tax dividends and\ninterest.\n\n8\n\n\fAnother important distinction between the federal system of taxation and the taxes levied\nat state and local levels is use of property taxes. In fact, property taxes tend to be the\nlargest revenue source for state and local governments. The primary property tax levied\nin the U.S. is a tax on real estate, including land, private residences, and commercial\nproperties. Generally, the tax is an annual assessment calculated as a proportion of the\nvalue of the property, although the formulas used by localities differ significantly.\nProperty taxes are commonly collected at a local level, but a share of property taxes is\nallocated for state purposes. Property taxes tend to be regressive, although less regressive\nthan excise and sales taxes. The reason is that high-income households tend to have a\nlower proportion of their assets subjected to property taxes. While renters do not directly\npay property taxes, most economists conclude that the costs of property taxes are largely\npassed on to renters in the form of higher rents.\nComposition of Tax Collections in the U.S.\nTable 1 presents government tax receipts, by tax source, for 2008 (the most recent year\nfor which complete data were available). The table shows that federal taxes dominate the\nnation\u2019s tax system with nearly 65% of all receipts. The largest federal tax is the income\ntax, followed closely by social insurance taxes. State and local tax systems are primarily\ndependent on sales, income, and property taxation. The data in Table 1 cover the major\ntaxes utilized in the United States. To gain a broader perspective on taxation, see Box 1\nfor a summary of tax mechanisms that are major revenue sources for some countries but\nare currently non-existent or insignificant in the U.S.\nTable 1. 2008 U.S. Tax Receipts, by Source\nSource\nFederal Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nSocial Insurance Taxes\nCorporate Taxes\nExcise Taxes\nEstate Taxes\nTotal, Federal Taxes\nState Taxes\nSales Taxes\nProperty Taxes\nIncome Taxes\nCorporate Taxes\nExcise and Other Taxes\nTotal, State Taxes\nTotal, All Taxes\n\nAmount (Millions $)\n\nPercent of All Taxes\n\n1,145,700\n900,200\n304,300\n67,300\n23,000\n2,440,500\n\n30.4%\n23.9%\n8.1%\n1.8%\n0.6%\n64.7%\n\n304,400\n409,700\n304,600\n57,800\n253,900\n1,330,400\n3,770,900\n\n8.1%\n10.9%\n8.1%\n1.5%\n6.7%\n35.3%\n100.0%\n\nSource: U.S. Census Bureau (2010), except for federal estate tax data from Tax Policy Center\n(2008).\n\n9\n\n\fBOX 1. TAX ALTERNATIVES\nIt is worthwhile to briefly consider tax types that are not currently important in the U.S.\nbecause these mechanisms are used in other countries or are central in various proposals\nto reform the U.S. tax system. We summarize five tax types here:\n1. National sales tax. This would function similar to a state sales tax \u2013 as an\naddition to the retail price of certain products. A national sales tax would clearly\nbe simpler and cheaper to administer than the current federal income tax. It would\nalso encourage savings because, under most proposals, income that is not spent on\ntaxable goods and services is not taxed. There are, however, two significant\ndisadvantages to a national sales tax. First, it would create an incentive for black\nmarket exchanges to evade the tax. Second, it can be highly regressive \u2013 similar\nto the regressivity of state sales taxes. A national sales tax could be made less\nregressive, or even progressive, by providing rebates for low-income households.\n2. National consumption tax. This is slightly different from a national sales tax. A\nhousehold would pay the tax at the end of the year based on the value of its annual\nconsumption of goods and services. Consumption can be calculated as total\nincome less money not spent on goods and services (i.e., invested or saved).\nAgain, a consumption tax would promote savings by exempting it from taxation.\nA consumption tax could also be designed to be progressive by taxing different\nlevels of consumption at different marginal rates.\n3. Value added tax. Most developed countries levy some form of value added tax\n(VAT). A VAT is levied at each stage in the production process of a product,\ncollected from manufacturers according to the value added at each stage. Thus,\nthe tax is not added to the retail price but incorporated into prices, similar to the\nway excise taxes become embedded into the price of products. Compared to a\nnational sales tax, a VAT reduces the likelihood of black markets.\n4. Wealth taxes. While the U.S. tax system includes local property taxes and, at\nleast for a while, estate taxes, there is no tax on holdings of other assets such as\ncorporate stocks, bonds, and personal property. Several European countries,\nincluding Sweden, Spain, and Switzerland, have instituted an annual wealth tax.\nA wealth tax could be very progressive by setting high rates and becoming\neffective only at significant wealth levels.\n5. Environmental taxes. These are levied on goods and services in proportion to\ntheir environmental impact. One example is a carbon tax, which taxes products\nbased on the emissions of carbon attributable to their production or consumption.\nThe rationale of environmental taxation is that it encourages the use and\ndevelopment of goods and services with reduced environmental impacts. Like\nother taxes on goods and services, environmental taxes can be regressive \u2013\nsuggesting that environmental taxes need to be combined with other progressive\ntaxes or rebates for low-income households. Among developed countries, the U.S.\ncollects the smallest share of tax revenues from environmental taxes (OECD,\n2010).\n\n10\n\n\fIII. A BRIEF HISTORY OF TAXATION IN THE U.S. 10\nBefore the Federal Income Tax\nThe tax mechanisms used during first 150 years or so of U.S. tax history bears little\nresemblance to the current system of taxation. First, the U.S. Constitution restricted\n\u201cdirect\u201d taxation by the federal government \u2013 meaning taxes directly on individuals.\nInstead, the federal government relied on indirect taxes including taxes on imports\n(tariffs) and excise taxes. Tariffs were the major source of U.S. government receipts\nfrom the beginning of the nation up to the early 1900\u2019s. For example, in 1800 custom\nduties comprised about 84% of government receipts (U.S. Census Bureau, 1960).\nInternal federal revenue collections (which exclude tariffs on imports) as recently as the\nearly 20th century were primarily derived from excise taxes on alcohol. In 1900 over\n60% of internal revenue collections came from alcohol excise taxes with another 20%\nfrom tobacco excise taxes.\nAnother important difference is the scale of government taxation and expenditures\nrelative to the entire economy. Government spending is currently a major portion of the\ntotal U.S. economy \u2013 in 2010 government expenditures and investment at all levels\ncomprised about 20% of total economic output. In the late 1800s government\nexpenditures were responsible for only about 2% of national output (earlier data on\nnational output are not available). The role of government has become more prominent\nas a result of expansion of military activity and an increase in the provision of public\nservices. Consequently an overall trend of increasing taxation is evident, although we\u2019ll\nsee that this trend has recently stabilized or reversed.\nThe Constitutional framers were wary of a government\u2019s power to tax. Taxation of the\nAmerican Colonies by a distant and corrupt England was a driving force behind the\nAmerican Revolution. Consequently, they believed in decentralized taxation and\ndelegated most public revenue collection to localities, which relied primarily on property\ntaxes. During peacetime the federal government was able to meet its expenses through\nrelatively modest excise taxes and tariffs. During times of war, such as the War of 1812,\nfederal taxes were temporarily raised to finance the war or pay down the ensuing debts.\nOnce the financial crisis passed, taxes were reduced in response to public opposition to\nhigh tax rates.\nLike previous wars, the Civil War initiated an increase in both excise tax and tariff rates.\nGovernment revenue collections increased by a factor of seven between 1863 and 1866.\nPerhaps the most significant tax policy enacted during the Civil War was the institution\nof the first national income tax. Concerns about the legality of the tax, considering the\nConstitution\u2019s prohibition of direct taxation, were muted during the national emergency.\nThe income tax rates were low by modern standards \u2013 a maximum rate of 10% along\nwith generous exemptions meant that only about 10% of households were subject to any\nincome tax. Still, the income tax generated over 20% of federal revenues in 1865. After\n10\n\nThe history of taxation is primarily derived from Brownlee (1996).\n\n11\n\n\fthe war, few politicians favored the continuation of the income tax, and in 1872 it was\nallowed to expire.\nThe impetus for the modern federal income tax rests not with a wartime emergency but\nwith the Populist movement of the late 1800s. The internal tax system in place at the\ntime, based primarily on excise taxes on alcohol and tobacco, was largely regressive.\nThe Populists revived interest in an income tax as a means to introduce a progressive tax\nbased on ability to pay. They saw it as a response to excessive monopoly profits and the\nconcentration of wealth and power. In other words, the tax was not envisioned as a\nmeans to generate significant additional public revenue but as a vehicle of social justice.\nA federal income tax, with a large exemption of $4,000, was instituted in 1894 but the\nSupreme Court ruled it unconstitutional in 1895. Over the next couple of decades\nproposals were made for a constitutional amendment to establish a federal income tax.\nWhile these attempts were defeated, support for federal income taxation gradually\nincreased. Eventually, in 1913 the 16th Amendment was ratified creating the legal basis\nfor the federal income tax.\nWhile the initial income tax was progressive, it was less radical than many desired. In\nfact, many conservatives expressed guarded support for the measure to prevent a more\nsignificant tax. While the income tax was targeted towards the wealthy \u2013 in the first few\nyears only about 2% of households paid any income tax \u2013 tax rates of only 1%-7%\nprevented it from generating significant revenues.\n\u201c...virtually none of the income tax proponents within the government believed\nthat the income tax would become a major, yet alone the dominant, permanent\nsource of revenue within the consumption-based federal tax system.\u201d (Brownlee,\n1996, p. 45)\nThese views were to quickly change as the nation required a dramatic increase in\nrevenues to finance World War I.\nThe Growth of Direct Taxation\nRather than relying on increases in excise taxes and tariffs to finance World War I, the\nadministration of Woodrow Wilson transformed the income tax framework laid down\njust a few years previously. Desiring both to raise additional revenue and enforce social\njustice, the top marginal rate increased dramatically from 7% in 1915 to 67% in 1917\n(IRS, 2002). Corporate taxes also became an important revenue source, accounting for\nover one-quarter of internal revenue collections in 1917. In 1916 the estate tax was\ncreated, not necessarily to generate large revenues but as another instrument of\nprogressive taxation.\nUnlike previous wars, much of the tax system laid down during World War I remained in\nplace after the war. In the period from 1910 to 1925 tariffs fell from about half of\ngovernment receipts to less than 15%. Meanwhile the new corporate and individual\n\n12\n\n\fincome taxes made up nearly half of government receipts in the mid 1920s. The level of\nexcise tax collections dropped significantly, especially during the years of Prohibition\nwhen alcohol excise taxes virtually disappeared.\nThe Great Depression, of course, caused a significant decline in federal receipts. In 1932\ntax rates were increased in an attempt to boost federal revenue. Franklin Roosevelt, in\nthe years leading up to World War II, presented progressive taxation as a key element of\nthe New Deal. However, the most significant measure enacted during this period was the\ncreation of old-age insurance.\nPrior to national social insurance programs, poverty was the common state of the elderly\n(Skidmore, 1999). By the 1930s, several European countries had already instituted\nprograms of social insurance. Germany was the first to establish old-age and survivors\npensions in 1889 (Peterson, 1999). The Great Depression finally motivated policy\nmakers in the U.S. to enact similar legislation. Rather than funding Social Security\nprograms through increases in income, or other, taxes, the funding mechanism was a\nseparate tax, split equally between employers and employees. All employees covered by\nthe system 11 contributed and received benefits regardless of their income. This design\nwas intended to protect the system from political attack. As everyone who pays into the\nsystem receives benefits, Social Security is not considered \u201cwelfare\u201d that is allocated to\nonly a segment of the population. Also, because Social Security is a separate tax,\ncontributors view their old-age payments as entitlements and oppose attempts to weaken\nthe program. This design has so far proved very successful \u2013 Social Security is often\ncalled the \u201cthird rail\u201d of American politics (i.e., touch it and you die).\nWorld War II created yet another emergency situation requiring additional revenues.\nSimilar to Woodrow Wilson during World War I, President Franklin Roosevelt sought to\nraise revenues primarily from higher taxes on corporations and high-income households.\nRoosevelt went so far as to state that:\n\u201cIn this time of grave national danger, when all excess income should go to win\nthe war, no American citizen ought to have a net income, after he has paid his\ntaxes, of more than $25,000.\u201d (Brownlee, 1996, p. 91)\nRoosevelt was unable to obtain enough Congressional support to enact his most\nprogressive proposals. The ensuing compromise did produce a more progressive federal\nincome tax but it also became levied on more households. Personal exemptions were\nreduced by half between 1939 and 1942 \u2013 meaning the income tax reached well into the\nmiddle class for the first time. The taxable income subject to the highest marginal rate\ndropped from $5 million in 1941 down to $200,000 in 1942. Also, the top marginal tax\nrate reached a record high of 94% in 1944. Another change during World War II was\nwithholding federal taxes from an employee\u2019s paycheck rather than requiring payment of\n\n11\n\nWhile Social Security has expanded over the years to cover more employees, all workers are not\ncurrently covered by the system. For example, about one-quarter of state and local government employees\nare not included in the system (Peterson, 1999).\n\n13\n\n\ftaxes due at the end of the year. These, as well as other, changes produced a dramatic\nshift in the structure of federal taxation:\n\u201cUnder the new tax system, the number of individual taxpayers grew from 3.9\nmillion in 1939 to 42.6 million in 1945, and federal income tax collections over\nthe period leaped from $2.2 billion to $35.1 billion. By the end of the war nearly\n90 percent of the members of the labor force submitted income-tax returns, and\nabout 60 percent of the labor force paid income taxes. \u2026 At the same time, the\nfederal government came to dominate the nation\u2019s revenue system. In 1940,\nfederal income tax had accounted for only 16 percent of the taxes collected by all\nlevels of government; by 1950 the federal income tax produced more than 51\npercent of all collections. Installation of the new regime was the most dramatic\nshift in the nation\u2019s tax policies since 1916.\u201d (Brownlee, 1996, p. 96-97)\nAs in the period after World War I, much of the new tax structure instituted during World\nWar II remained in place after the war. Both major political parties expressed support for\na progressive but broad income tax, relatively flat tax rates on corporate profits, and\nsocial insurance taxes that were basically regressive. Public support for the existing tax\nsystem was boosted by patriotic feelings and broad-based economic growth after the war.\nChanges to the tax system between the end of World War II and the 1980\u2019s were\ngenerally minor. The Social Security tax occasionally increased as more people were\nreceiving benefits. The initial tax rate of 2% (1% each for employers and employees) had\nincreased to 6.13% by 1979. The Medicare and Medicaid programs were established in\nthe 1960s. Across-the-board tax cuts in 1964 reduced marginal rates for both low- and\nhigh-income households (the top marginal rate fell from 91% in 1963 to 70% in 1965).\nStill, government continued to become a more significant portion of the entire economy\nin the decades after World War II. Total government expenditure and investment\nincreased gradually from less than 18% of GDP in 1946 to over 22% by the mid 1970s.\nFrom the \u201cReagan Revolution\u201d to the Bush Tax Cuts\nThe general stasis of the federal tax system ended in the 1980s with the passage of\nseveral important tax reforms. Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980 on a\nplatform of smaller government and lower taxes. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of\n1981 (ERTA) enacted the largest tax cut in American history 12 and inspired tax cutting\nby many other nations in the 1980s. The supply-side rationale behind ERTA\u2019s sharp\nreduction in tax rates, particularly on high-income households and capital, was that\ngreater incentives would motivate increased investment and economic activity. The\nensuing economic growth and consequent tax revenue growth would, in theory, more\nthan offset the revenue reductions as a result of the tax cuts. Thus, the theory was that tax\ncuts could actually produce an increase in federal revenues and address the growing\nfederal budget deficit as well. ERTA phased in a reduction in the top tax rate from 70%\nto 50%, enacted several corporate tax cuts, and indexed many tax parameters to inflation\n(such as personal exemptions and deductions).\n12\n\nWhen measured in constant dollars (adjusted for inflation).\n\n14\n\n\fAnalysis suggests that, in reality, ERTA resulted in the largest reduction in federal\nrevenues of any tax bill since World War II (Tempalski, 1998). The federal budget\ndeficit continued to grow. The very next year, in 1982, the largest peacetime tax increase\nwas passed (Martin, 1991). The act repealed some of the more revenue-reducing\nprovisions of ERTA, such as accelerated depreciation reductions for corporations, and\nclosed several corporate loopholes in the tax code. Social Security reforms were enacted\nin 1983 that increased Social Security tax rates and initiated taxation of some benefits.\nReagan continued to push for further tax reforms, leading to the Tax Reform Act of 1986\n\u2013 considered to be the most comprehensive revision of the tax code since the 1950s\n(Petska and Strudler, 1999). This act reduced top income tax rates even further \u2013 from\n50% in 1986 to 28% in 1988. Among many other changes, it also lowered the top\ncorporate tax rate from 46% to 34%.\nClearly, the \u201cReagan revolution\u201d is an important era in U.S. tax history, but many people\nmisinterpret it as a period where the size of the federal government was drastically\nreduced and taxes cut significantly. Despite the two major tax cuts during Reagan\u2019s\nterms, federal revenue collections increased at nearly the same pace as national output\n(total federal revenues increased about 76% from 1980-1988 while GDP increased 83%).\nThe actual changes were more evident in the distribution of federal revenues than their\ntotal level. The share of revenues from both individual and corporate taxation fell (by 9%\nand 16% respectively) while the portion from social insurance taxes increased by 38%.\nAs the individual and corporate taxes are progressive, while social insurance taxes are\nregressive, the outcome was a decrease in the overall progressivity of the federal tax\nsystem. Specific changes within the individual income tax code exacerbated the decline\nin progressivity.\nThe Reagan era failed to control the growing federal deficit. The annual budget deficits\nof the federal government tripled during the 1980s 13 (OMB, 2003). Partly to raise\nadditional revenue to try to reduce deficits, the first President Bush reneged on his\ncampaign promise of \u201cno new taxes\u201d and agreed to a compromise tax proposal in 1990\nthat raised the top marginal tax bracket to 31%. President Clinton reinstated additional\nprogressivity in 1993 by creating the 36% and 39.6% individual tax brackets. In 1993,\nthe corporate tax rate was increased slightly to 35%. These changes produced an increase\nin the progressivity of federal taxes.\nThe most recent important tax legislation was the $1.35 trillion Bush tax cut passed in\n2001. The major provisions of this act include lowering individual income tax rates\nacross-the-board, scheduling repeal of the estate tax in 2010, and increasing the amount\nemployees can contribute under various programs for retirement purposes. Many of the\nbill\u2019s provisions are \u201cback-loaded,\u201d meaning the tax reductions are phased in over time\nwith most of the tax reduction occurring in the future. For example, the top marginal\nbracket fell from 39.6% in 2001 to 38.6% in 2002 but eventually fell to 35.0% in 2006.\n\n13\n\nThis is based on the \u201con-budget\u201d calculations. The on-budget accounting excludes the Social Security\ntrust fund as well as other minor balances.\n\n15\n\n\fThe Bush tax cut reduced the overall progressiveness of the federal income tax as highincome taxpayers received a disproportionate share of the total cuts (CTJ, 2001).\nA somewhat smaller tax cut was passed in 2003 that, among other changes, accelerated\nscheduled tax rate decreases and lowered the maximum tax rate on capital gains and\ndividends. Most recently, the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009\ninstituted or expanded various tax credits such as a payroll tax credit of $400 per worker\nand an expanded tax credit for college tuition.\n\nIV. Summary Data of U.S. Tax History\nUntil quite recently, tax collections have tended to increase over time; paralleling the\nincrease in the size of the federal government. We see in Figure 1 that federal tax\nrevenues have grown considerably during the 20th century, even after adjusting for\ninflation. A large increase in federal tax collections occurred during World War II, with\nrelatively consistent growth after about 1960. However, notice occasional declines in\nfederal tax revenues, due either to recessions or to major tax code changes. The growth\nFigure 1. Tax Collections, 1913-2009 (All values in 2009 dollars) 14\n\n14\n\nData on state and local taxes are incomplete and/or inconsistent prior to 1932. All data from various\neditions of the Statistical Abstract of the United States and U.S. Census Bureau (1960).\n\n16\n\n\fof state and local tax collections, by comparison, has been steadier with less fluctuation.\nThe reason is that state and local tax revenues are derived primarily from property and\nsales taxes, which vary less than income (particularly corporate income) during business\ncycles.\nAnother way to illustrate the growth of federal taxation is to measure it relative to\nnational economic output. In Figure 2 we plot federal and state and local tax collections\nas a share of GDP. Three facts are evident from Figure 2. First, total tax collections have\ngenerally grown as a percentage of GDP over the 20th century. Again, the largest leap\noccurred during World War II, but some additional growth is evident after the war as\nwell. The second fact is that federal tax revenues now substantially exceed state and\nlocal tax revenues. While World War II solidified the federal government as the primary\ntax collector in the U.S., note that this trend began prior to the war. Finally, note the\ndecline in federal taxes as a percentage of GDP since 2000. This is a result of both\neconomic recessions and declines in federal tax rates. In fact, federal taxes as a\npercentage of GDP were lower in 2009 than in any year since the 1940s.\nFigure 2. Tax Collections as a Percentage of GDP, 1913-2009 15\n\nAs federal revenues grew during the 20th century, the composition of taxation has\nchanged considerably. We see in Figure 3 that at the beginning of the century federal\ntaxation was dominated by excise taxes. Except for a revival of excise taxes during the\nDepression Era, their importance has generally diminished over time. Corporate taxes\nbecame the most significant source of federal revenues for the period 1918-1932. After a\nperiod of higher corporate taxes during World War II, corporate taxes have generally\ndiminished in significance relative to other forms of federal taxation. Personal income\n15\n\nData on state and local taxes are incomplete and/or inconsistent prior to 1932.\n\n17\n\n\ftaxes became the largest source of federal revenues in 1944 and have remained so. Since\nWorld War II, income taxes have consistently supplied between 40-50% of federal\nrevenues. Since about 1950, social insurance taxes have increased their share of federal\nrevenues from about 10% up to nearly 40%. In fact, social insurance taxes may soon\nexceed personal income taxes as the largest source of federal revenues.\n\nFigure 3. Composition of Federal Taxes, 1913-2009\n\nThe composition of state and local taxes, with its increased reliance on sales and property\ntaxes, differs from the composition of federal taxes. Of course, each state has a different\ntax system \u2013 some states have no income and/or sales taxes, and tax rates can differ\nsignificantly across states. In this module, we combine tax data for all states rather than\npresenting a state-by-state analysis. Figure 4 presents the composition of state and local\ntaxes over the period 1945-2009. The two major trends that are evident are a decline in\nthe importance of property taxes and an increase in the importance of personal income\ntaxes except for a recent reversal of these trends in the last few years. While property\ntaxes were the primary source of state and local revenues until the 1970s, sales taxes\nbecame the major source of revenues until 2008, when property taxes again became the\nmajor revenue source.\n\n18\n\n\fFigure 4. Composition of State and Local Taxation, 1945-2009\n\nV. THE DISTRIBUTION OF TAXES IN THE UNITED STATES\nTax Incidence Analysis\nThere are basically two ways to analyze how the tax burden is distributed. The easiest\nway is to measure the taxes directly paid by entities, such as households or businesses,\nclassified according to criteria such as household income, business profit levels, etc.\nThese data can be obtained directly from aggregate tax return data published by the IRS\nand from reports from other government agencies. This approach considers only who\nactually pays the tax to the government. Thus, it would allocate corporate taxes to\ncorporations, excise taxes to manufacturers, sales taxes to consumers, etc.\nThe second approach, called tax incidence analysis, is more complex yet more\nmeaningful. While taxes are paid by various entities other than individuals, such as\ncorporations, partnerships, and public service organizations, the burden of all taxes\nultimately fall on people. The final incidence of taxation is contingent upon how a\nspecific tax translates into changes in prices and changes in economic behavior among\nconsumers and businesses:\n\u201cTax incidence is the study of who bears the economic burden of a tax. More\ngenerally, it is the positive analysis of the impact of taxes on the distribution of\nwelfare within a society. It begins with the very basic insight that the person who\n\n19\n\n\fhas the legal obligation to make a tax payment may not be the person whose\nwelfare is reduced by the existence of the tax. The statutory incidence of a tax\nrefers to the distribution of those legal tax payments \u2013 based on the statutory\nobligation to remit taxes to the government. ...\nEconomic incidence differs from statutory incidence because of changes in\nbehavior and consequent changes in equilibrium prices. Consumers buy less of a\ntaxed product, so firms produce less and buy fewer inputs \u2013 which changes the net\nprice or return to each input. Thus the job of the incidence analyst is to determine\nhow those other prices change, and how those price changes affect different\ngroups of individuals.\u201d (Metcalf and Fullerton, 2002, p. 1)\nTax incidence analysis has produced a number of generally accepted conclusions\nregarding the burden of different tax mechanisms. Remember, for example, that the\npayroll tax on paper is split equally between employer and employee:\n\u201cSo, who really pays the payroll tax? Is the payroll tax reflected in reduced\nprofits for the employer or in reduced wages for the worker? ... there is generally\nuniversal agreement that the real burden of the tax falls almost entirely on the\nworker. Basically, an employer will only hire a worker if the cost to the employer\nof hiring that worker is no more than the value that worker can add. So, a worker\nis paid roughly what he or she adds to the value of production, minus the payroll\ntax; in effect, the whole tax is deducted from wages. ... to repeat, this is not a\ncontroversial view; it is the view of the vast majority of analysts...\u201d (Krugman,\n2001, p. 43)\nThe most common assumption made regarding the allocation of corporate taxes is that\nthe burden of these taxes falls almost exclusively on the owners of capital investments.\nGiven the mobility of capital, the burden is not limited to owners of corporate capital but\nextends to owners of all capital. 16 This result is primarily a theoretical finding \u2013 in reality\nsome portion of the corporate tax burden likely falls on workers (through lower wages)\nand consumers (through higher prices).\nExcise taxes, although directly paid by manufacturers, are generally attributed entirely to\nconsumers according to their consumption patterns. 17 This result is based on an\nassumption of perfect competition in the affected industries. Real-world markets,\nhowever, are not perfectly competitive. The actual incidence of excise taxes will depend\non the degree of competition in an industry. For example, imperfectly competitive\nindustries with upward-sloping supply curves imply that prices increase by less than the\ntax and that a portion of excise taxes is borne by businesses. 18\n\n16\n\nSee summary in Metcalf and Fullerton (2002).\nSee CBO (2008).\n18\nSee Fullerton and Metcalf (2002) for a summary of incidence assumptions and analyses for different\ntypes of taxes.\n17\n\n20\n\n\fThe burden of sales taxes is generally assumed to fall directly on consumers who buy the\ntaxed goods and services. Again, this is a simplifying assumption \u2013 in reality some\nportion of sales taxes filters to corporate owners, other capital owners, and workers.\nPersonal income taxes paid by households are directly attributed to those households\npaying the tax. Estate tax burdens fall on the heirs paying the tax. Finally, property tax\nburdens are generally assumed to fall on property owners although the burden can be\npassed on renters (some analysts attribute property taxes more broadly to owners of\ncapital).\nSo, for several types of tax mechanisms (personal income, sales, excise, and estate taxes),\ndata on direct tax payments is analogous to tax incidence. However, for other taxes\n(payroll, corporate, and to a lesser extent property taxes) the direct data on tax payments\nwill differ from the ultimate burden of the tax.\nUsing Effective Tax Rate Data to Determine Tax Progressivity\nAs mentioned before, a tax is progressive if the percentage of income a person pays for\nthe tax increases as income increases. Thus, we can determine whether a tax is\nprogressive or regressive by looking at a table showing the effective tax rates for a\nparticular tax for people in different income categories. If effective tax rates increase\n(decrease) with increasing income, then the tax is progressive (regressive). Table 2\nshows the percentage of income people in each adjusted gross income (AGI) category\npaid in federal income taxes in 2008, the most recent data available. We see that\neffective tax rates for the federal income tax tend to increase with increasing income\n(although not always). For taxpayers making less than $100,000 AGI per year, the\nTable 2. Distribution of Federal Income Taxes, 2008\n\nAGI Category\n\nPercent of\nReturns\n16.7\n\nAverage\nAGI\n$5,099\n\nAverage\nIncome Taxes\n$177\n\nEffective Income\nTax Rate\n3.5%\n\n16.0\n\n$14,927\n\n$513\n\n3.4%\n\n13.0\n\n$24,798\n\n$1,421\n\n5.7%\n\n18.0\n\n$39,126\n\n$2,808\n\n7.2%\n\n13.5\n\n$61,470\n\n$5,246\n\n8.5%\n\n8.2\n9.7\n2.4\n0.4\n\n$86,421\n$133,208\n$285,735\n$679,576\n\n$8,037\n$16,903\n$55,984\n$163,513\n\n9.3%\n12.7%\n19.6%\n24.1%\n\n0.2\n\n$3,349,101\n\n$780,550\n\n23.3%\n\n$1-$10,000\n$10,000-$20,000\n$20,000-$30,000\n$30,000-$50,000\n$50,000-$75,000\n$75,000 - $100,000\n$100,000-$200,000\n$200,000-$500,000\n$500,000$1,000,000\nMore than\n$1,000,000\n\n21\n\n\feffective federal income tax rate averages less than 10% of income. For those making\nmore than $200,000 per year, the federal income tax averages more than 20% of income.\nThe federal income tax is clearly progressive because those with higher incomes\ngenerally pay a larger share of their income for the tax. For a regressive tax, effective tax\nrates tend to decrease as income increases. If effective tax rates are constant at different\nincome levels, then a tax is proportional.\nLooking at effective tax rates by income categories can normally determine whether a tax\nis progressive or regressive. However, there may be some cases where effective tax rates\ndo not follow a consistent pattern across income levels. For example, suppose that\neffective taxes first increase but then decrease as we move up the income spectrum.\nAnother limitation with data on effective tax rates is that this approach does not tell us the\ndegree of progressivity or regressivity. We might not be able to determine whether one\ntax is more progressive than another or whether a particular tax becomes more or less\nprogressive over time.\nResearchers have come up with several tax indices that measure the progressivity of a tax\nas a single number. These indices allow direct comparisons across different tax types and\nacross time. The most common tax progressivity index is discussed in Box 2.\nEffective Tax Rates in the United States\nData on the distribution of taxes in the U.S. are available from several sources. The\ngovernment sources that publish data on tax distribution include the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS), the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), the Congressional Budget Office\n(CBO), and the Office of Tax Analysis within the U.S. Treasury. The IRS data are the\nmost detailed but focus on federal income and estate taxes. The IRS publishes data on\ncorporate taxes but does not conduct tax incidence analysis. The JCT occasionally\nconducts tax incidence analyses but only on the federal income tax, payroll taxes, and\nfederal excise taxes. The CBO adds the incidence of federal corporate taxes to their\nanalyses but still omits the federal estate tax and all state and local taxes.\nThe only source for tax incidence data for all taxes in the U.S. is Citizens for Tax Justice\n(CTJ), a non-profit organization. CTJ uses data from government sources but has\ndeveloped its own models of tax incidence. Comparison of tax progressivity data from\nCTJ with data from the federal sources listed above indicates that their results are\ngenerally similar to the government\u2019s results and not biased in either direction (Roach,\n2003).\n\n22\n\n\fBOX 2. MEASURING TAX PROGRESSIVITY \u2013 THE SUITS INDEX\nThe Suits Index, developed by Daniel Suits in the 1970s (Suits, 1977), calculates a single\nnumber that measures tax progressivity. The approach basically compares the cumulative\nshare of income received by taxpayers, order from lowest to highest, to their cumulative\nshare of taxes paid. For a progressive (regressive) tax, the share of taxes paid will tend to\nbe less (more) than the share of income as we move up the income spectrum. Other tax\nprogressivity indices have been developed but the Suits Index remains the most widely\nused approach (Anderson, et al., 2003).\nWhile the calculation details are not presented here, the Suits Index is a number ranging\nbetween \u20131 and +1. A negative Suits Index means that the tax is regressive while a\npositive index indicates a progressive tax (with a value of zero for a proportional tax).\nThe Suits Index can be used to compare the degree of progressivity of different tax types\nas well as determine whether a tax becomes more or less progressive over time.\nThe Suits Index has been used to estimate the progressivity of different tax types in the\nU.S. for 2007 (Roach, 2010). Table 2.1 shows that the U.S. tax system contains a mixture\nof progressive and regressive taxes. The federal estate tax is the most progressive tax\nwhile the federal corporate and income taxes are also progressive. On the other hand,\nfederal excise taxes are the most regressive. Federal social insurance taxes and overall\nstate and local taxes are also regressive. When all federal taxes are considered, the Suits\nIndex of +0.18 indicates that federal taxation is progressive. The entire U.S. tax system is\nalso progressive, but the recent Suits Indices of +0.05 and +0.06 are closer to a value of\nzero (a proportional tax) than just the federal tax system.\nTable 2.1.

We see that while the\nfederal tax system is progressive, the state and local tax system is, on average, regressive.\nOverall, the tax system in the U.S. is progressive, although the rate of progressivity levels\noff at upper income levels and actually reverses at the highest income level in Table 3.\nTable 3.

Most analyses are limited to one, or a few, tax types. Further,\ninterest groups can interpret the available data to support their particular agendas. For an\nillustration about how the same tax data can be used to support different claims, see Box\n3.\nAnalysis of tax progressivity over time indicates that the federal tax system is about as\nprogressive now as it was in the late 1970s (Roach, 2010). The progressivity of the\nfederal tax system declined during the early 1980s, rose in 1987 (the year following the\npassage of the Tax Reform Act of 1986), either remained stable or rose slightly up to the\nmid-200s, and decreased slightly since the mid-200s.\nComplete data on the distribution of state and local taxes are available from Citizens for\nTax Justice for 1995, 2002, 2007, and 2009, with Suits Indices of -0.11, -0.07, -0.12, and\n-0.07 respectively. Thus the available data suggest no obvious overall trend in the\nregressivity of state and local taxes. The unavailability of consistent data on the\ndistribution of state and local taxes makes determination of the trends in the overall U.S.\n\n19\n\nData from CTJ, 2010.\n\n24\n\n\ftax system difficult to determine. As Table 2.1 indicated, total taxes declined in\nprogressivity from 2001 to 2004, and then stayed about the same from 2004 to 2009.\n\nBOX 3. INTERPRETING TAX PROGRESSIVITY DATA\nHas the federal income tax burden on the very wealthy been increasing or decreasing in\nrecent decades? Data published by the CBO reveals that the percent of federal income\ntaxes paid by the highest-income taxpayers has increased steady over the past few\ndecades. In 1979, the top 1% of taxpayers paid about 18.3% of all federal income taxes.\nIn 2007, the top 1% of taxpayers paid over 39.5%. Clearly, these data suggest that the\nfederal income tax has become much more progressive since 1979.\nHowever, these statistics represent an incomplete analysis. Specifically, it fails to\nconsider how the proportion of income accruing to the top 1% has changed over the same\ntime period. The increasing tax share paid by high-income taxpayers may be a function of\nan increase in income, rather than a change in the tax system. In other words, if the share\nof all income received by the top 1% increased, we would naturally expect that their share\nof taxes paid would also increase without any changes in the underlying progressivity of\nthe tax system. Income statistics indicate that the share of income going to the top 1% of\ntaxpayers has also increased significantly since 1979. The top 1% of taxpayers received\nless than 9.2% of income in 1979 but more than 19.4% in 2007. Based on this fact alone,\nwe would expect the top 1% to be paying a greater share of all federal income taxes.\nSo, has the federal income tax burden on the top 1% increased or decreased since 1979?\nWe can combine the tax and income data for a more complete analysis. The share of\nincome going to the top 1% increased by a factor of 2.1 between 1979 and 2007.\nMeanwhile, their share of taxes paid has increased by a factor of 2.2. This suggests that\nthe share of taxes paid by the top 1% has risen by about as much as much as their share of\nincome \u2013 indicating a relatively stable degree of tax progressivity in the federal income\ntax \u2013 a dramatically different conclusion had we only considered data on tax shares!\n\n25\n\n\fReferences\nBrownlee, W.

Progressive taxation is based on\nthe view that higher-income taxpayers can pay higher tax rates without having to\nforego life\u2019s basic necessities. Progressive taxation can also redress economic\ninequalities and collect a given level of revenue while maintaining the maximum\nlevel of economic growth.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe federal income tax is the most complicated and debated tax in the U.S. tax\nsystem. The federal income tax is progressive, with increasing marginal tax rates.\nFederal income taxes are calculated based on taxable income, which is less than\ntotal income because various exemptions and deductions are allowed.\n\n\u2022\n\nThe federal tax system in the U.S. also includes social insurance, corporate,\nexcise, estate, and gifts taxes. Social insurance and excise taxes are regressive\nwhile corporate, estate, and gift taxes are progressive. The U.S. tax system also\nincludes state and local taxes, primarily sales, income, and property taxes.\n\n\u2022\n\nNearly 70% of the taxes levied in the U.S. are collected at the federal level. The\nlargest federal tax is the income tax, closely followed by social insurance taxes.\nThe most significant non-federal tax is property taxes, followed by sales and\nincome taxes.\n\n\u2022\n\nUp until the early 1900s, the U.S. tax system primarily relied on excise taxes and\ntariffs for public revenues. The 16th Amendment, ratified in 1913, created the\nlegal basis for federal income taxation, which up to that point had been prohibited\nunder the Constitution.\n\n\u2022\n\nBoth World Wars led to significant changes in the structure and overall magnitude\nof taxes in the U.S. By the end of World War II, U.S. taxes were broad-based but\nprogressive and dominated by federal-level taxation.\n\n\u2022\n\nTax cuts passed during the Reagan Administration in the 1980s were based on the\ntheory that lower tax rates would spur economic growth, leading to a net increase\nin tax revenues. This theory was not supported by the evidence, eventually\nleading to tax increases in the early 1990s. The Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 and\n2003 have made federal taxes less progressive.\n\n\u2022\n\nTax revenues in the U.S. increased dramatically during the 20th century, even after\nadjusting for inflation. When measured as a percentage of GDP, tax revenues\ngrew significantly during World War II, grew at a slower pace afterwards, and\nleveled off recently at around 30% of GDP.\n\n29\n\n\f\u2022\n\nMeasuring the distribution of taxes requires tax incidence analysis, which\ndetermines the ultimate burden of a tax on taxpayers. Tax incidence analysis\ngenerally concludes that social insurance taxes fall on workers, corporate taxes\nfall on the owners of capital, excise taxes fall on consumers, and property taxes\nare passed on to renters.\n\n\u2022\n\nEffective tax rates measured by income level can be used to determine whether a\nparticular tax is progressive or regressive. While the U.S. tax system contains\nboth progressive and regressive taxes, the overall system is progressive. Recent\ndata suggest that federal taxes are becoming less progressive while state and local\ntaxes are becoming more regressive.\n\n30\n\n\fDISCUSSION QUESTIONS\n\n1. Comment on the following statement: \u201cThe fairest type of tax system is one in\nwhich everyone pays the same rate of taxation, regardless of income.\u201d Do you\nagree or disagree with the statement? Why?\n2. Suppose you could set the overall effective tax rates across different levels of\nincome. What do you think should be the appropriate effective tax rates for a\nhousehold of four (two adults and two children) with an income of $25,000? An\nincome of $60,000? An income of $100,000? An income of $500,000? Is the\nsystem you devise more or less progressive than the tax system currently in place\nin the U.S.? How does your system compare with others in your class?\n3. The U.S. tax system is currently comprised of many different types of taxes\n(income, social insurance, corporate, sales, property, etc.). What reasons could be\ngiven to support the use of many different tax types in a nation? Do you think\nthat a nation\u2019s tax system should be comprised of many different types of taxes or\njust one type of tax? If you had to choose just one type of tax to levy in a nation,\nwhat type of tax would you choose? Why?\n4. Comment on the following statement: \u201cAs long as a tax cut reduces taxes for\neveryone, then everyone will be better off as a result of the tax cut.\u201d Do you\nagree with this statement? Why or why not?\n5. Using the Internet or other sources, look up information about basic structure of\nthe tax system in place in a country other than the United States. What\ndifferences are evident in that country\u2019s tax system? Do you think that country\nhas a more or less progressive tax system? Which nation\u2019s tax system is\npreferable to you? Why?\n6. Locate a recent news story about a proposal for a change to the tax system, either\nat the federal or state level. Summarize the proposed change. Would the change\nincrease or decrease tax progressivity? Who would benefit most from the\nproposal? Who would be hurt the most from the proposal? Do you support the\nproposal? Why or why not?\n\n31\n\n\fADDITIONAL RESOURCES\n\u2022\n\nAll the federal government agencies that work on tax issues maintain web sites that\nprovide tax data and reports. The IRS\u2019s Statistics of Income Bulletins, published four\ntimes a year, can be found dating back to 1998 at\nhttp://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=117514,00.html. The SOI Bulletins provide\ndata analysis of primarily individual and corporate taxes. Publications produced by\nthe Joint Committee on Taxation can be found at\nhttp://www.jct.gov/publications.html. Publications by the Congressional Budget\nOffice related to tax issues, going as far back as the 1970s, are available at\nhttp://www.cbo.gov/publications/bysubject.cfm?cat=33. Finally, tax analysis by the U.S.\nTreasury Department, only dating back to 2001, can be found at\nhttp://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Pages/default.aspx.\n\n\u2022\n\nA large amount of tax-related data is published annually in the Statistical Abstract of\nthe United States. Each year\u2019s edition includes a chapter on state and local\ngovernment finances and another chapter on federal government finances. The\nCensus Bureau has recently added select historical editions of the Statistical Abstract\ndating as far back as 1878, although online availability is more complete for the first\nhalf of the 20th century than the latter half of the century (see\nhttp://www.census.gov/compendia/statab).\n\n\u2022\n\nCitizens for Tax Justice publishes many other tax analyses besides those referenced in\nthis module. Their web site is www.ctj.org. Two other non-profit organizations that\nconduct tax analysis are the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute\nand Brookings Institution, and the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities. The Tax\nPolicy Center (www.taxpolicycenter.org) publishes several reports each month on a\nwide range of tax issues, including distributional impacts and public budget\nimplications. The CBPP (www.cbpp.org) research focuses on \u201cfiscal policy and\npublic programs that affect low- and moderate-income families and individuals.\u201d\nSimilar to the Tax Policy Center, the CBPP conducts distributional analyses of\ncurrent tax proposals.\n\n\u2022\n\nFor an opposing view on tax issues, the Tax Foundation (www.taxfoundation.org)\npublishes tax analyses that generally support lower overall taxes and conclude that the\ndistributional impacts of recent tax cuts are fair. A similar organization, with a more\nactivist agenda, is Americans for Tax Reform (www.atr.org).\n\n32\n\n\fKEY TERMS AND CONCEPTS\nAbility-to-pay principle: the idea that higher-income households and individuals should\npay higher tax rates than lower-income taxpayers because they are more able to bear the\ntax without foregoing life\u2019s basic necessities.\nAdjusted gross income (AGI): the total income of a household or individual minus\ncertain out-of-pocket expenses such as retirement account contributions, student loan\ninterest, tuition, and other allowable subtractions.

Similar patterns are reported in Australia and\nCanada, but a comprehensive global analysis of\ncontemporary data is lacking.\nDesign We extracted long-term data from Cancer\nIncidence in Five Continents and supplemental sources\nto report on worldwide CRC incidence rates and trends\nby age (20\u201349 years and \u226550 years) through diagnosis\nyear 2012 or beyond (Australia, Finland, New Zealand,\nNorway, Sweden, USA).\nResults During 2008\u20132012, age-standardised CRC\nincidence rates in adults <50 ranged from 3.5 per\n100 000 (95% CI 3.2 to 3.9) in India (Chennai) to\n12.9 (95% CI 12.6 to 13.3) in Korea. During the\nmost recent decade of available data, incidence in\nadults <50 was stable in 14 of 36 countries; declined\nin Austria, Italy and Lithuania; and increased in 19\ncountries, nine of which had stable or declining trends\nin older adults (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany,\nNew Zealand, Slovenia, Sweden, UK and USA). In\nCyprus, Netherlands and Norway, inclines in incidence\nin young adults were twice as rapid as those in older\nadults (eg, Norway average annual per cent change\n(AAPC), 1.9 (95% CI 1.4 to 2.5) vs 0.5 (95% CI 0.3 to\n0.7)). Among most high-income countries with longterm data, the uptick in early-onset disease began in\nthe mid-1990s. The steepest increases in young adults\nwere in Korea (AAPC, 4.2 (95% CI 3.4 to 5.0)) and\nNew Zealand (AAPC, 4.0 (95% CI 2.1 to 6.0)).\nConclusion CRC incidence increased exclusively in\nyoung adults in nine high-income countries spanning\nthree continents, potentially signalling changes\nin early-life exposures that influence large bowel\ncarcinogenesis.\n\nIntroduction\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their\nemployer(s)) 2019.

In general,\nCRC incidence is rising in low-income and\nmiddle-income countries but beginning to stabilise or decline in high-income countries, especially those that have implemented screening.2\nHowever, accumulating evidence from studies\n\nSignificance of this study\nWhat is already known on this subject?\n\n\u25ba\u25ba Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence rates in\n\nyoung adults (aged <50 years) are increasing\nin several countries, despite declining rates in\nolder adults.

Conversely, CRC declined in young\nadults in only three countries (Italy, Austria and\nLithuania) compared with 11 countries in adults\n50 and older.\n\nHow might it impact on clinical practice in the\nforeseeable future?\n\u25ba\u25ba Improving awareness of the marked increases\nin young-onset CRC incidence could facilitate\nmore diligent assessment of cancer family\nhistory by primary care clinicians, as well as\nfollow-up of symptoms in young individuals,\nmany of whom are diagnosed at a late stage.\nThese findings also highlight the need for\nresearch on early-life exposures in relation to\ncolorectal carcinogenesis.\nof cancer registry data indicates that favourable overall trends are masking an increase in\nyoung-onset CRC in the USA,3\u20136 Australia7 8 and\nCanada.9 Although the absolute risk of CRC in\nadults younger than 50 years is low relative to\nolder adults, disease trends in young age groups\nare a key indicator of recent changes in risk factor\nexposures and often foreshadow the future cancer\nburden.10 In addition to country-specific analyses, there are recent reports on early-onset CRC\noccurrence in seven high-income countries,11 in\nEurope12 and in 11 \u2018industrialised\u2019 countries (data\nthrough 2007).13 However, a comprehensive\nexamination of contemporary trends on a global\nscale is lacking. We analysed high-quality longterm population-based data on CRC occurrence\nby age at diagnosis for 43 countries covering six\ncontinents.\n\nSiegel RL, et al.

Specifically,\non submission the data coding is verified, the format is standardised, and an editorial board conducts an evaluation based\non three dimensions of quality: comparability, completeness and\nvalidity. (For more information about the database, see c\u200b i5.\u200biarc.\u200b\nfr/\u200bCI5-\u200bXI/\u200bDefault.\u200baspx.) The population coverage of registries\nincluded in CI5 may be national or subnational. If a country\nis represented by one or more registries but without national\ncoverage, the registries are specified. National or subnational\nregistries with cancer incidence data going back to at least 1998\nwere included and multiple datasets from subnational registries\nwithin a single country were combined, resulting in a total of\n43 countries examined. To take advantage of the availability of\n2\n\nmore contemporary incidence, we obtained additional data by\ncontacting individual registries or accessing publicly available\ndata online. We acquired data through 2015 from Australia (\u200b\nwww.\u200b\naihw.\u200b\ngov.\u200b\nau/); through 2016 from Finland (personal\ncommunication), New Zealand (personal communication) and\nthe USA (\u200bseer.\u200bcancer.\u200bgov/\u200bdata/); and through 2017 from Norway\n(personal communication) and Sweden (\u200bsdb.\u200bsocialstyrelsen.\u200bse/\u200b\nif_\u200bcan/\u200bval.\u200baspx). Seven countries had fewer than 10 CRC cases\namong ages 20\u201349 years in any single diagnosis year and were\nexcluded from trend analysis.\nIncidence was stratified by age at diagnosis, categorised as\n20\u201349 years (\u2018early-onset\u2019) or 50 years or older (\u2018older adults\u2019).\nCancer subsite was categorised according to the International\nClassification of Diseases, 10th revision as colon (code C18) or\nrectum (code C19-C20). Given that trends in CRC incidence\nare quite similar in men and women overall2 and for earlyonset disease,6 15 16 the two sexes were combined to improve\nstability. Primary outcome measures were average annual incidence rates during diagnosis years 2008\u20132012 (42 countries;\ndata unavailable for Finland) and time-weighted average annual\nper cent change (AAPC) in incidence rates during the last 10\nyears of available data (36 countries) based on joinpoint regression analysis. This method fits joined straight lines (joinpoints)\nto observed annual age-standardised rates on a logarithmic\nscale.17 The maximum number of joinpoints is determined by\nthe number of years available for each country/registry and was\nlimited to four for countries with \u226524 data years. Trends are\ndescribed as \u2018increasing\u2019 or \u2018decreasing\u2019 if the AAPC is statistically significantly different from zero (p<0.05) and \u2018stable\u2019\notherwise. All rates are expressed per 100 000 population and\nage-standardised to the 1960 Segi world standard population\n(as modified by Doll and Cook).18 In a sensitivity analysis, we\nassessed the extent to which the inclusion of appendiceal cancer\n(C18.1) in the CI5plus grouping for colon cancer influenced our\nresults by calculating rates and trends exclusive of appendix for\nthree countries for which these data were available (USA, New\nZealand and Canada).\n\nResults\nCRC incidence during 2008\u20132012\nAmong 42 countries with high-quality population-based cancer\nregistry data, cross-sectional age-standardised CRC incidence\nrates in ages 20\u201349 years during 2008\u20132012 were lowest in\nIndia (Chennai; 3.5 per 100 000 (95% CI 3.2 to 3.9)); Uganda\n(3.8, 95% CI 3.0 to 4.6); and Chile (3.8, 95% CI 2.5 to 5.1)\nand highest in Korea (12.9, 95% CI 12.6 to 13.3); Australia\n(11.2, 95% CI 10.9 to 11.5); the USA (10.0, 95% CI 9.8 to\n10.3); and Slovakia (10.0, 95% CI 9.3 to 10.7; figure 1; online\nsupplementary table 1). The pattern in older adults was quite\nsimilar, with rates ranging from 27.5 (95% CI 25.9 to 29.1)\nin India to 192.5 (95% CI 188.6 to 196.3) in Slovakia (online\nsupplementary table 2). Among young adults, incidence was\ngenerally higher for tumours developing in the colon than in\nthe rectum, with a more than twofold difference in rates in\nIceland, Italy and Cyprus (online supplementary tables 3 and\n4). Exceptions were in Slovenia, where rates were similar, and\nKorea, India and China, where rates were slightly higher for\nrectal cancer. In contrast, incidence rates in older adults were a\nminimum of 7% higher for colon cancer than for rectal cancer\n(India, 14.2 per 100 000 vs 13.3) and commonly twofold\nhigher, particularly in high incidence countries (online supplementary tables 5 and 6).\nSiegel RL, et al.

The increasing CRC trend in adults <50 in the\nremaining 19 countries was unique to that age group in nine\ncountries (figure 2A). Among these nine countries, rates in older\nadults declined by 1%\u20132.4% per year in Germany, Canada, New\nZealand, Australia, and USA, and were stable in UK, Sweden,\nDenmark, and Slovenia. Where data were available prior to\n1990, the uptick in early-onset CRC began during 1992\u20131996\nand was preceded by declining rates except in Slovenia, where\nthere was a continuous increase of 0.8% per year from 1983 to\n2012 (figure 3; online supplementary table 1).\nEarly-onset CRC incidence increased most rapidly in Korea\n(AAPC, 4.2 (95% CI 3.4 to 5.0)), where rates rose at a similar\npace among adults 50 and older (figure 2B). Incidence increased\nin both younger and older age groups in about one-quarter of\ncountries examined; among these, the magnitude of the AAPC\nfor young adults was notably larger than that for older adults in\nCyprus, Netherlands and Norway. In Norway, for example, the\nSiegel RL, et al.

In the Netherlands, the respective\nAAPCs were 2.0 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.4) versus 1.1 (95% CI 0.7 to\n1.6), and the most recent linear (joinpoint) segment (2007\u20132012)\nwas stable in older adults.

Thus, the AAPC for colon cancer\n(excluding appendix) is substantially smaller than that for rectal\ncancer (2.1, 95% CI 1.7 to 2.5) whereas it previously appeared\nidentical. Results were similar for New Zealand and Canada.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe found that the geographic variation in CRC incidence among\nadults ages 20\u201349 mirrors that in older adults, with a threefold\ndifference between the highest (12.9 per 100 000 in Korea) and\nlowest (3.5 per 100 000 in India) rates. In contrast, age-specific\ntemporal trends were variable, with a decline limited to three\ncountries (Austria, Italy and Lithuania) for young-onset CRC\nversus 11 for older adults. Conversely, increasing incidence was\nunique to young adults in nine high-income countries (Australia,\nCanada, Denmark, Germany, New Zealand, Slovenia, Sweden,\nUK and USA) spanning three continents, often against a backdrop\nof rapidly declining rates in older adults. Similarly, increasing\ntrends in Cyprus, Netherlands and Norway were twice as steep\nin young adults as in older adults. Our findings are consistent\nwith previous, mostly country-level studies of age-related differences in temporal trends of CRC.5 7\u20139 11\nThe most rapid increases in early-onset CRC occurred in\ncountries where rates are already highest, such as Korea, which\nhad the same pattern for older adults. Reasons for the high and\nescalating burden in Korea are unclear, but may be related to the\nrapid dietary transition that took place in the wake of remarkable economic growth following the Korean war.20 Changes\nin the food supply were also initiated by the importation of\nwheat from the USA in response to food shortages in the late\n1960s, which prompted the production of many wheat-derived\nprocessed foods during the 1970s. Shortly thereafter was the\nintroduction of fast-food restaurants especially popular among\nyouth. The obesity epidemic may also be a factor, given that East\nAsia has experienced among the largest relative increases in body\nmass index (BMI) worldwide among both adults and children.21\nAsians have disproportionately high levels of visceral adiposity\ncompared with Caucasians,22 23 which may more strongly influence CRC risk than BMI or waist circumference.24 25 Another\npotential contributor is the high prevalence of early-life antibiotic use, which has been associated with increased risk of\ncolorectal adenoma, especially in the rectum.26 A recent study\nfound that among six high-income countries, South Korea had\nthe highest rate of paediatric antibiotic consumption, sevenfold\nhigher than that in Norway, which had the lowest rate.27 The\nadenoma detection rate among Korean individuals in their 40s\nhas been reported at almost 30%,28 three times higher than that\nin Australians.29\nEarly-onset CRC also increased rapidly in countries where\nrisk in older adults is declining at a similar pace, such as New\nZealand, Australia, Canada and the USA. Reductions in CRC\nincidence among older adults in some countries are partly\nattributed to changing patterns in risk factors, such as reductions\nin smoking and widespread use of anti-inflammatory drugs.2 30\nLikewise, rising incidence confined to young age groups signals\nchanges in early life exposures that adversely influence CRC risk,\nparticularly given the strong birth cohort effect apparent in the\ntrend.5 9 11 Notably, eight of the nine countries with a unique rise\nin early-onset CRC had declining rates prior to the uptick beginning in the mid-1990s. Reductions in the prevalence of protective\nfactors, such as physical activity (for colon cancer) and sufficient\nintake of dietary fibre, dairy, and fruits and vegetables, may\nplay a role, as well as increased prevalence of obesity, smoking,\nSiegel RL, et al. Gut 2019;0:1\u20137. doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2019-319511\n\nred and/or process meat consumption, and/or excess alcohol\nconsumption.31\nObesity was recently found to be associated with a 20%\nexcess risk of early-onset CRC,32 and prevalence has risen most\nrapidly in young adults33 and in English-speaking high-income\ncountries,34 consistent with early-onset CRC patterns. However,\nincreases in BMI are quite similar across Europe, despite varying\nCRC trends. For example, BMI increased from 24 kg/m2 in\n1975 to 27 in 2014 in men in Germany, where early-onset CRC\nincreased, as well as in Austria, Croatia, Israel and Italy, where it\ndid not.34 BMI increases in women were smaller but also comparable. In addition, there are puzzling variations in the CRC trend\nby subsite,5 11 as well as by race/ethnicity and state within the\nUSA,35 36 that suggest a role for risk factors beyond obesity. For\nexample, obesity and a sedentary lifestyle are more strongly\nassociated with colon tumours,37\u201340 yet rectal tumours appear to\nbe driving the increase based on our findings herein and those\nof other studies.5 9 11 35 If this is true, the rectal epithelium may\nbe more exposed and/or susceptible to the carcinogenic mechanisms causing the increase in disease.\nCRC risk is intrinsically linked to diet and its influence on gut\nimmune response and inflammation.41 The global food supply\nhas changed substantially in recent decades42 and evolving\nresearch is exploring the carcinogenic potential of relatively new\nfood components. For example, associations have been uncovered between CRC and moderate consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages,43 as well as high fructose corn syrup specifically\nin animal studies,44 both in the absence of obesity and metabolic\nsyndrome. An inflammatory diet, characterised by high consumption of processed foods and high-glycaemic load carbohydrates,\ncreates an environment conducive to colonic proliferation45\nand appears to increase CRC risk.46 What remains uncertain is\nhow these dietary elements might influence early-life gut health.\nImportantly, the association between CRC and currently established risk factors is based almost entirely on disease occurrence\nin older aged cohorts.47\nCRC screening programmes have mostly emerged over the\npast two decades and likely contributed to the declines in incidence among older adults in 11 countries. Of the 36 countries\nin our trend analysis, only four (Costa Rica, Cyprus, India and\nPhilippines) lack a screening programme according to a recent\nglobal overview.48 In most countries, screening for CRC (generally with a stool test) is recommended to begin between the\nages of 50 and 60 years. Exceptions are Italy, where screening\nbegins at age 44 years, and China, Japan and Austria, where it\nbegins at age 40. Notably, two (Austria and Italy) of the three\ncountries where early-onset CRC declined have screened individuals beginning in their fourth decade since the early 1980s.48\nMoreover, the decreasing trend among young adults in both\nAustria and Italy was confined to ages 40\u201349 years, with rates\nin ages 20\u201339 years increasing by 3% per year in Austria (data\nnot shown). Although some of the rapid increases in early-onset\nCRC are reminiscent of the Korean thyroid cancer \u2018epidemic\u2019\nthat resulted from widespread ultrasound screening,49 overdetection of early-onset CRC is unlikely because screening before\nage 50 is rare in most countries, and mortality rates have also\nbegun to rise.12 50 After an extensive evidence review, the American Cancer Society recently lowered the recommended age to\nbegin screening from 50 to 45 because disease risk in individuals under 50 has shifted substantially51 and Cancer Intervention\nand Surveillance Modeling Network modelling studies found a\ngreater benefit to burden ratio for initiation at age 45 compared\nwith 50.52\u201354 The US Preventive Services Task Force, the other\nUS entity that issues cancer screening guidelines, is currently in\n5\n\nGut: first published as 10.1136/gutjnl-2019-319511 on 5 September 2019.

Accumulating evidence\nsuggests that these tumours differ from those that develop in\nthe colon in their biology and other characteristics.55 Inclusion\nof appendix attenuates comparisons of the burden for colon\nversus rectal cancer. Additionally, although appendiceal cancer\naccounts for only about 10% of cases in ages <50 years (data\nfor USA, New Zealand and Canada), incidence rates are rising\nrapidly in high-income countries56 57 due to changes in classification and improved detection. This likely hindered our ability\nto detect the steeper rise for rectal than for colon cancer that\nhas been reported by numerous studies of early-onset CRC\ntrends excluding appendix,5 9 11 but less often by those including\nappendix.12 Similarly, results from our sensitivity analyses that\nexcluded appendix found larger increases for rectal than for\ncolon tumours in each of the three countries with these data\navailable. Incidence trends may also be influenced by temporal\nimprovements in the quality of data, case capture, and specificity\nof coding. Other study limitations include incomplete population coverage for long-term incidence data in many countries;\nlack of more contemporary data (eg, since 2012) for most countries; and the absence of high-quality cancer registry data for the\nmajority of low-income and middle-income countries.\nIn summary, CRC incidence rates uniquely increased in young\nadults over the past two decades in nine high-income countries\nspanning three continents, often in sharp contrast to rapid declines\nin older adults. These patterns potentially signal changes in\nearly-age exposures conducive to large bowel carcinogenesis and\nhighlight an urgent need for research to explore the potentially\nunique aetiology of young-onset CRC. Beyond awaiting scientific\ndiscovery, clinicians have an opportunity to help mitigate premature morbidity and mortality from CRC with active documentation of familial cancer history; timely follow-up of symptoms,\nregardless of patient age; and screening when appropriate.\nAcknowledgements The authors gratefully acknowledge all cancer registries and\ntheir staff for their hard work and diligence in collecting cancer information, without\nwhich this research could not have been done.\nContributors Study concept and design: RS, AJ.

Similar patterns are reported in Australia and\nCanada, but a comprehensive global analysis of\ncontemporary data is lacking.\nDesign We extracted long-term data from Cancer\nIncidence in Five Continents and supplemental sources\nto report on worldwide CRC incidence rates and trends\nby age (20\u201349 years and \u226550 years) through diagnosis\nyear 2012 or beyond (Australia, Finland, New Zealand,\nNorway, Sweden, USA).\nResults During 2008\u20132012, age-standardised CRC\nincidence rates in adults <50 ranged from 3.5 per\n100 000 (95% CI 3.2 to 3.9) in India (Chennai) to\n12.9 (95% CI 12.6 to 13.3) in Korea. During the\nmost recent decade of available data, incidence in\nadults <50 was stable in 14 of 36 countries; declined\nin Austria, Italy and Lithuania; and increased in 19\ncountries, nine of which had stable or declining trends\nin older adults (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Germany,\nNew Zealand, Slovenia, Sweden, UK and USA). In\nCyprus, Netherlands and Norway, inclines in incidence\nin young adults were twice as rapid as those in older\nadults (eg, Norway average annual per cent change\n(AAPC), 1.9 (95% CI 1.4 to 2.5) vs 0.5 (95% CI 0.3 to\n0.7)). Among most high-income countries with longterm data, the uptick in early-onset disease began in\nthe mid-1990s. The steepest increases in young adults\nwere in Korea (AAPC, 4.2 (95% CI 3.4 to 5.0)) and\nNew Zealand (AAPC, 4.0 (95% CI 2.1 to 6.0)).\nConclusion CRC incidence increased exclusively in\nyoung adults in nine high-income countries spanning\nthree continents, potentially signalling changes\nin early-life exposures that influence large bowel\ncarcinogenesis.\n\nIntroduction\n\n\u00a9 Author(s) (or their\nemployer(s)) 2019.

Gut\nEpub ahead of print: [please\ninclude Day Month Year].\ndoi:10.1136/\ngutjnl-2019-319511\n\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most\ncommonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, with an\nestimated 1.8 million new cases in 2018.1 Global\npatterns vary widely and are strongly linked to\nhuman development index level, reflecting the\nadoption of western lifestyles that accompany\neconomic transition and elevate risk. In general,\nCRC incidence is rising in low-income and\nmiddle-income countries but beginning to stabilise or decline in high-income countries, especially those that have implemented screening.2\nHowever, accumulating evidence from studies\n\nSignificance of this study\nWhat is already known on this subject?\n\n\u25ba\u25ba Colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence rates in\n\nyoung adults (aged <50 years) are increasing\nin several countries, despite declining rates in\nolder adults. The extent to which this pattern is\noccurring on a global scale is unknown.\n\nWhat are the new findings?\n\n\u25ba\u25ba CRC incidence rates are uniquely increasing\n\nin young adults in nine high-income countries\n(Germany, USA, Australia, Canada, New\nZealand, UK, Denmark, Slovenia and Sweden)\nacross North America, Europe and Oceania\nwhere rates in older adults are stable or\ndeclining. Conversely, CRC declined in young\nadults in only three countries (Italy, Austria and\nLithuania) compared with 11 countries in adults\n50 and older.\n\nHow might it impact on clinical practice in the\nforeseeable future?\n\u25ba\u25ba Improving awareness of the marked increases\nin young-onset CRC incidence could facilitate\nmore diligent assessment of cancer family\nhistory by primary care clinicians, as well as\nfollow-up of symptoms in young individuals,\nmany of whom are diagnosed at a late stage.\nThese findings also highlight the need for\nresearch on early-life exposures in relation to\ncolorectal carcinogenesis.\nof cancer registry data indicates that favourable overall trends are masking an increase in\nyoung-onset CRC in the USA,3\u20136 Australia7 8 and\nCanada.9 Although the absolute risk of CRC in\nadults younger than 50 years is low relative to\nolder adults, disease trends in young age groups\nare a key indicator of recent changes in risk factor\nexposures and often foreshadow the future cancer\nburden.10 In addition to country-specific analyses, there are recent reports on early-onset CRC\noccurrence in seven high-income countries,11 in\nEurope12 and in 11 \u2018industrialised\u2019 countries (data\nthrough 2007).13 However, a comprehensive\nexamination of contemporary trends on a global\nscale is lacking. We analysed high-quality longterm population-based data on CRC occurrence\nby age at diagnosis for 43 countries covering six\ncontinents.\n\nSiegel RL, et al.

Specifically,\non submission the data coding is verified, the format is standardised, and an editorial board conducts an evaluation based\non three dimensions of quality: comparability, completeness and\nvalidity. (For more information about the database, see c\u200b i5.\u200biarc.\u200b\nfr/\u200bCI5-\u200bXI/\u200bDefault.\u200baspx.) The population coverage of registries\nincluded in CI5 may be national or subnational. If a country\nis represented by one or more registries but without national\ncoverage, the registries are specified. National or subnational\nregistries with cancer incidence data going back to at least 1998\nwere included and multiple datasets from subnational registries\nwithin a single country were combined, resulting in a total of\n43 countries examined. To take advantage of the availability of\n2\n\nmore contemporary incidence, we obtained additional data by\ncontacting individual registries or accessing publicly available\ndata online. We acquired data through 2015 from Australia (\u200b\nwww.\u200b\naihw.\u200b\ngov.\u200b\nau/); through 2016 from Finland (personal\ncommunication), New Zealand (personal communication) and\nthe USA (\u200bseer.\u200bcancer.\u200bgov/\u200bdata/); and through 2017 from Norway\n(personal communication) and Sweden (\u200bsdb.\u200bsocialstyrelsen.\u200bse/\u200b\nif_\u200bcan/\u200bval.\u200baspx). Seven countries had fewer than 10 CRC cases\namong ages 20\u201349 years in any single diagnosis year and were\nexcluded from trend analysis.\nIncidence was stratified by age at diagnosis, categorised as\n20\u201349 years (\u2018early-onset\u2019) or 50 years or older (\u2018older adults\u2019).\nCancer subsite was categorised according to the International\nClassification of Diseases, 10th revision as colon (code C18) or\nrectum (code C19-C20). Given that trends in CRC incidence\nare quite similar in men and women overall2 and for earlyonset disease,6 15 16 the two sexes were combined to improve\nstability. Primary outcome measures were average annual incidence rates during diagnosis years 2008\u20132012 (42 countries;\ndata unavailable for Finland) and time-weighted average annual\nper cent change (AAPC) in incidence rates during the last 10\nyears of available data (36 countries) based on joinpoint regression analysis. This method fits joined straight lines (joinpoints)\nto observed annual age-standardised rates on a logarithmic\nscale.17 The maximum number of joinpoints is determined by\nthe number of years available for each country/registry and was\nlimited to four for countries with \u226524 data years. Trends are\ndescribed as \u2018increasing\u2019 or \u2018decreasing\u2019 if the AAPC is statistically significantly different from zero (p<0.05) and \u2018stable\u2019\notherwise. All rates are expressed per 100 000 population and\nage-standardised to the 1960 Segi world standard population\n(as modified by Doll and Cook).18 In a sensitivity analysis, we\nassessed the extent to which the inclusion of appendiceal cancer\n(C18.1) in the CI5plus grouping for colon cancer influenced our\nresults by calculating rates and trends exclusive of appendix for\nthree countries for which these data were available (USA, New\nZealand and Canada).\n\nResults\nCRC incidence during 2008\u20132012\nAmong 42 countries with high-quality population-based cancer\nregistry data, cross-sectional age-standardised CRC incidence\nrates in ages 20\u201349 years during 2008\u20132012 were lowest in\nIndia (Chennai; 3.5 per 100 000 (95% CI 3.2 to 3.9)); Uganda\n(3.8, 95% CI 3.0 to 4.6); and Chile (3.8, 95% CI 2.5 to 5.1)\nand highest in Korea (12.9, 95% CI 12.6 to 13.3); Australia\n(11.2, 95% CI 10.9 to 11.5); the USA (10.0, 95% CI 9.8 to\n10.3); and Slovakia (10.0, 95% CI 9.3 to 10.7; figure 1; online\nsupplementary table 1). The pattern in older adults was quite\nsimilar, with rates ranging from 27.5 (95% CI 25.9 to 29.1)\nin India to 192.5 (95% CI 188.6 to 196.3) in Slovakia (online\nsupplementary table 2). Among young adults, incidence was\ngenerally higher for tumours developing in the colon than in\nthe rectum, with a more than twofold difference in rates in\nIceland, Italy and Cyprus (online supplementary tables 3 and\n4). Exceptions were in Slovenia, where rates were similar, and\nKorea, India and China, where rates were slightly higher for\nrectal cancer. In contrast, incidence rates in older adults were a\nminimum of 7% higher for colon cancer than for rectal cancer\n(India, 14.2 per 100 000 vs 13.3) and commonly twofold\nhigher, particularly in high incidence countries (online supplementary tables 5 and 6).\nSiegel RL, et al.

In the Netherlands, the respective\nAAPCs were 2.0 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.4) versus 1.1 (95% CI 0.7 to\n1.6), and the most recent linear (joinpoint) segment (2007\u20132012)\nwas stable in older adults.

Thus, the AAPC for colon cancer\n(excluding appendix) is substantially smaller than that for rectal\ncancer (2.1, 95% CI 1.7 to 2.5) whereas it previously appeared\nidentical. Results were similar for New Zealand and Canada.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe found that the geographic variation in CRC incidence among\nadults ages 20\u201349 mirrors that in older adults, with a threefold\ndifference between the highest (12.9 per 100 000 in Korea) and\nlowest (3.5 per 100 000 in India) rates. In contrast, age-specific\ntemporal trends were variable, with a decline limited to three\ncountries (Austria, Italy and Lithuania) for young-onset CRC\nversus 11 for older adults. Conversely, increasing incidence was\nunique to young adults in nine high-income countries (Australia,\nCanada, Denmark, Germany, New Zealand, Slovenia, Sweden,\nUK and USA) spanning three continents, often against a backdrop\nof rapidly declining rates in older adults. Similarly, increasing\ntrends in Cyprus, Netherlands and Norway were twice as steep\nin young adults as in older adults. Our findings are consistent\nwith previous, mostly country-level studies of age-related differences in temporal trends of CRC.5 7\u20139 11\nThe most rapid increases in early-onset CRC occurred in\ncountries where rates are already highest, such as Korea, which\nhad the same pattern for older adults. Reasons for the high and\nescalating burden in Korea are unclear, but may be related to the\nrapid dietary transition that took place in the wake of remarkable economic growth following the Korean war.20 Changes\nin the food supply were also initiated by the importation of\nwheat from the USA in response to food shortages in the late\n1960s, which prompted the production of many wheat-derived\nprocessed foods during the 1970s. Shortly thereafter was the\nintroduction of fast-food restaurants especially popular among\nyouth. The obesity epidemic may also be a factor, given that East\nAsia has experienced among the largest relative increases in body\nmass index (BMI) worldwide among both adults and children.21\nAsians have disproportionately high levels of visceral adiposity\ncompared with Caucasians,22 23 which may more strongly influence CRC risk than BMI or waist circumference.24 25 Another\npotential contributor is the high prevalence of early-life antibiotic use, which has been associated with increased risk of\ncolorectal adenoma, especially in the rectum.26 A recent study\nfound that among six high-income countries, South Korea had\nthe highest rate of paediatric antibiotic consumption, sevenfold\nhigher than that in Norway, which had the lowest rate.27 The\nadenoma detection rate among Korean individuals in their 40s\nhas been reported at almost 30%,28 three times higher than that\nin Australians.29\nEarly-onset CRC also increased rapidly in countries where\nrisk in older adults is declining at a similar pace, such as New\nZealand, Australia, Canada and the USA. Reductions in CRC\nincidence among older adults in some countries are partly\nattributed to changing patterns in risk factors, such as reductions\nin smoking and widespread use of anti-inflammatory drugs.2 30\nLikewise, rising incidence confined to young age groups signals\nchanges in early life exposures that adversely influence CRC risk,\nparticularly given the strong birth cohort effect apparent in the\ntrend.5 9 11 Notably, eight of the nine countries with a unique rise\nin early-onset CRC had declining rates prior to the uptick beginning in the mid-1990s. Reductions in the prevalence of protective\nfactors, such as physical activity (for colon cancer) and sufficient\nintake of dietary fibre, dairy, and fruits and vegetables, may\nplay a role, as well as increased prevalence of obesity, smoking,\nSiegel RL, et al. Gut 2019;0:1\u20137. doi:10.1136/gutjnl-2019-319511\n\nred and/or process meat consumption, and/or excess alcohol\nconsumption.31\nObesity was recently found to be associated with a 20%\nexcess risk of early-onset CRC,32 and prevalence has risen most\nrapidly in young adults33 and in English-speaking high-income\ncountries,34 consistent with early-onset CRC patterns. However,\nincreases in BMI are quite similar across Europe, despite varying\nCRC trends. For example, BMI increased from 24 kg/m2 in\n1975 to 27 in 2014 in men in Germany, where early-onset CRC\nincreased, as well as in Austria, Croatia, Israel and Italy, where it\ndid not.34 BMI increases in women were smaller but also comparable. In addition, there are puzzling variations in the CRC trend\nby subsite,5 11 as well as by race/ethnicity and state within the\nUSA,35 36 that suggest a role for risk factors beyond obesity. For\nexample, obesity and a sedentary lifestyle are more strongly\nassociated with colon tumours,37\u201340 yet rectal tumours appear to\nbe driving the increase based on our findings herein and those\nof other studies.5 9 11 35 If this is true, the rectal epithelium may\nbe more exposed and/or susceptible to the carcinogenic mechanisms causing the increase in disease.\nCRC risk is intrinsically linked to diet and its influence on gut\nimmune response and inflammation.41 The global food supply\nhas changed substantially in recent decades42 and evolving\nresearch is exploring the carcinogenic potential of relatively new\nfood components. For example, associations have been uncovered between CRC and moderate consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages,43 as well as high fructose corn syrup specifically\nin animal studies,44 both in the absence of obesity and metabolic\nsyndrome. An inflammatory diet, characterised by high consumption of processed foods and high-glycaemic load carbohydrates,\ncreates an environment conducive to colonic proliferation45\nand appears to increase CRC risk.46 What remains uncertain is\nhow these dietary elements might influence early-life gut health.\nImportantly, the association between CRC and currently established risk factors is based almost entirely on disease occurrence\nin older aged cohorts.47\nCRC screening programmes have mostly emerged over the\npast two decades and likely contributed to the declines in incidence among older adults in 11 countries. Of the 36 countries\nin our trend analysis, only four (Costa Rica, Cyprus, India and\nPhilippines) lack a screening programme according to a recent\nglobal overview.48 In most countries, screening for CRC (generally with a stool test) is recommended to begin between the\nages of 50 and 60 years. Exceptions are Italy, where screening\nbegins at age 44 years, and China, Japan and Austria, where it\nbegins at age 40. Notably, two (Austria and Italy) of the three\ncountries where early-onset CRC declined have screened individuals beginning in their fourth decade since the early 1980s.48\nMoreover, the decreasing trend among young adults in both\nAustria and Italy was confined to ages 40\u201349 years, with rates\nin ages 20\u201339 years increasing by 3% per year in Austria (data\nnot shown). Although some of the rapid increases in early-onset\nCRC are reminiscent of the Korean thyroid cancer \u2018epidemic\u2019\nthat resulted from widespread ultrasound screening,49 overdetection of early-onset CRC is unlikely because screening before\nage 50 is rare in most countries, and mortality rates have also\nbegun to rise.12 50 After an extensive evidence review, the American Cancer Society recently lowered the recommended age to\nbegin screening from 50 to 45 because disease risk in individuals under 50 has shifted substantially51 and Cancer Intervention\nand Surveillance Modeling Network modelling studies found a\ngreater benefit to burden ratio for initiation at age 45 compared\nwith 50.52\u201354 The US Preventive Services Task Force, the other\nUS entity that issues cancer screening guidelines, is currently in\n5\n\nGut: first published as 10.1136/gutjnl-2019-319511 on 5 September 2019.

Accumulating evidence\nsuggests that these tumours differ from those that develop in\nthe colon in their biology and other characteristics.55 Inclusion\nof appendix attenuates comparisons of the burden for colon\nversus rectal cancer. Additionally, although appendiceal cancer\naccounts for only about 10% of cases in ages <50 years (data\nfor USA, New Zealand and Canada), incidence rates are rising\nrapidly in high-income countries56 57 due to changes in classification and improved detection. This likely hindered our ability\nto detect the steeper rise for rectal than for colon cancer that\nhas been reported by numerous studies of early-onset CRC\ntrends excluding appendix,5 9 11 but less often by those including\nappendix.12 Similarly, results from our sensitivity analyses that\nexcluded appendix found larger increases for rectal than for\ncolon tumours in each of the three countries with these data\navailable. Incidence trends may also be influenced by temporal\nimprovements in the quality of data, case capture, and specificity\nof coding. Other study limitations include incomplete population coverage for long-term incidence data in many countries;\nlack of more contemporary data (eg, since 2012) for most countries; and the absence of high-quality cancer registry data for the\nmajority of low-income and middle-income countries.\nIn summary, CRC incidence rates uniquely increased in young\nadults over the past two decades in nine high-income countries\nspanning three continents, often in sharp contrast to rapid declines\nin older adults. These patterns potentially signal changes in\nearly-age exposures conducive to large bowel carcinogenesis and\nhighlight an urgent need for research to explore the potentially\nunique aetiology of young-onset CRC. Beyond awaiting scientific\ndiscovery, clinicians have an opportunity to help mitigate premature morbidity and mortality from CRC with active documentation of familial cancer history; timely follow-up of symptoms,\nregardless of patient age; and screening when appropriate.\nAcknowledgements The authors gratefully acknowledge all cancer registries and\ntheir staff for their hard work and diligence in collecting cancer information, without\nwhich this research could not have been done.\nContributors Study concept and design: RS, AJ.

{"system_instruction": "Use only the provided context block to find answers to the user prompt. Do not use external sources.", "user_request": "What did FCC have to do with 230?", "context_document": "Section 230 was enacted in 1996 in response to a trial court ruling that allowed an online platform to be subject to liability for hosting defamatory speech, in part because the platform had said it would police its site for unwanted speech. Congress was concerned that this ruling created a perverse incentive for sites to refrain from monitoring content to avoid liability. Section 230 can be seen as speech-protective: by barring lawsuits that would punish platforms for hosting speech, it may encourage platforms to err on the side of hosting more content, while still allowing sites to take down content they see as objectionable. To this end, Section 230 contains two different provisions that courts have generally viewed as two distinct liability shields.\nFirst, Section 230(c)(1) states that interactive computer service providers and users may not \u201cbe treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another\u201d person. This provision has been broadly interpreted to bar a wide variety of suits that would treat service providers as the publisher of another\u2019s content, including claims of defamation, negligence, discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and state criminal prosecutions. However, if a site helps develop the unlawful content, courts have ruled that Section 230(c)(1) immunity does not apply. Accordingly, courts have, for example, rejected applying Section 230 to cases brought by the FTC against a defendant website that solicited or was involved in publishing allegedly unlawful content. More generally, Section 230 will not bar suits that seek to hold sites liable for their own conduct, rather than another\u2019s content. But courts have said that acts inherent to publishing, such as reviewing, suggesting, and sometimes even editing content, may not, by themselves, qualify as helping develop the challenged content. As a consequence, Section 230(c)(1) immunity can apply regardless of whether the site chooses to actively police content or whether it chooses to take a more hands-off approach.\nSecond, Section 230(c)(2) provides that interactive computer service providers and users may not be \u201cheld liable\u201d for any voluntary, \u201cgood faith\u201d action \u201cto restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable.\u201d Section 230(c)(2) also immunizes providing \u201cthe technical means to restrict access\u201d to objectionable material. Unlike Section 230(c)(1), Section 230(c)(2) applies only to good faith actions to restrict objectionable material. Courts have ruled that allegations of anticompetitive motives can demonstrate bad faith, disqualifying sites from claiming Section 230(c)(2) immunity. There are, however, relatively few published federal court cases interpreting this provision.\nBecause Section 230(c)(2) contains a good-faith requirement and Section 230(c)(1) does not, some courts have recognized the importance of determining when each immunity provision applies. At least one decision suggests that Section 230(c)(2) applies when a service provider \u201cdoes filter out offensive material,\u201d while Section 230(c)(1) applies when providers \u201crefrain from filtering or censoring the information on their sites.\u201d But, as one scholar has noted, other courts have cited Section 230(c)(1) when dismissing claims predicated on takedowns. Another possibility is that Section 230(c)(1) does not apply when the plaintiff\u2019s own content is at issue\u2014that is, while Section 230(c)(1) immunity only applies if a third party created the disputed content, Section 230(c)(2) can apply when a person sues a site for taking down the plaintiff\u2019s own content. Again, however, other decisions suggest that courts may apply Section 230(c)(1) even when the suit involves the plaintiff\u2019s own content. Athird view is that Section 230(c)(2) might apply if the provider helps develop content and is therefore ineligible for (c)(1) immunity. In short, court rulings are inconsistent on the question of when each of the two immunity provisions governs.\nSection230(e)expressly states that the law will not bar liability in certain cases.Defendants may not claim Section 230 immunity in federal criminal prosecutions, cases involving intellectual property laws, suits under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act or \u201csimilar\u201d state laws, and certain civil actions and state criminal prosecutions relating to sex trafficking.\nIf Section 230\u2019s liability shield does not apply, the person being sued will not automatically be held liable. Instead, it means only that courts can continue to adjudicate the case. The EO begins by stating in Section 1 the President\u2019s belief that online platforms are engaging in \u201cselective censorship,\u201d harming national discourse and restricting Americans\u2019 speech. Section 2 turns to the interpretation of Section 230(c), arguing that the \u201cscope\u201d of this immunity provision \u201cshould be clarified\u201d and the law should not be extended to platforms that \u201cengage in deceptive or pretextual actions\u201d to censor \u201ccertain viewpoints.\u201d The EO maintains that Congress intended Section 230(c) to only protect service providers that engage in \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d blocking of harmful content. Section 2 further states that providers should not be entitled to Section 230(c)(2) immunity if they remove content without acting in \u201cgood faith,\u201d including by taking \u201cdeceptive or pretextual actions (often contrary to their stated terms of service)\u201d to suppress certain viewpoints.\nSection 2 also directs the Commerce Secretary, \u201cin consultation with the Attorney General, and acting through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA),\u201d to request the FCC to issue regulations interpreting Section 230. Among other things, the EO, perhaps in response to the Section 230 jurisprudence discussed above, specifies that FCC\u2019s proposed regulations should clarify:\n(1) \u201cthe interaction between\u201d Section 230(c)(1) and (c)(2) to explain when a service provider that cannot obtain Section 230(c)(2) immunity is also ineligible for protection under (c)(1); and (2) the meaning of \u201cgood faith\u201d in Section 230(c)(2), including whether violating terms of service or failing to provide procedural protections qualifies as bad faith.\nSection 4 of the EO instructs the FTC to \u201cconsider taking action, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\u201d Specifically, the EO suggests that if platforms \u201crestrict speech in ways that do not align with those entities\u2019 public representations about\u201d how they monitor content on their sites, these acts may qualify as unfair or deceptive practices under the FTC Act. The EO also directs the FTC to consider whether complaints of \u201conline censorship\u201d received by the White House \u201callege violations of law,\u201d and whether to develop a report on these complaints.\nThe other provisions of the EO assign additional tasks to more executive departments. Section 3 of the EO requires agency review of federal spending on advertising and marketing on online platforms, and Sections 5 and 6 contain instructions for the Attorney General to establish a working group and propose federal legislation to implement the policies announced in the EO.", "full_prompt": "System instructions: [Use only the provided context block to find answers to the user prompt.

Courts have ruled that allegations of anticompetitive motives can demonstrate bad faith, disqualifying sites from claiming Section 230(c)(2) immunity. There are, however, relatively few published federal court cases interpreting this provision.\nBecause Section 230(c)(2) contains a good-faith requirement and Section 230(c)(1) does not, some courts have recognized the importance of determining when each immunity provision applies. At least one decision suggests that Section 230(c)(2) applies when a service provider \u201cdoes filter out offensive material,\u201d while Section 230(c)(1) applies when providers \u201crefrain from filtering or censoring the information on their sites.\u201d But, as one scholar has noted, other courts have cited Section 230(c)(1) when dismissing claims predicated on takedowns. Another possibility is that Section 230(c)(1) does not apply when the plaintiff\u2019s own content is at issue\u2014that is, while Section 230(c)(1) immunity only applies if a third party created the disputed content, Section 230(c)(2) can apply when a person sues a site for taking down the plaintiff\u2019s own content. Again, however, other decisions suggest that courts may apply Section 230(c)(1) even when the suit involves the plaintiff\u2019s own content. Athird view is that Section 230(c)(2) might apply if the provider helps develop content and is therefore ineligible for (c)(1) immunity. In short, court rulings are inconsistent on the question of when each of the two immunity provisions governs.\nSection230(e)expressly states that the law will not bar liability in certain cases.Defendants may not claim Section 230 immunity in federal criminal prosecutions, cases involving intellectual property laws, suits under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act or \u201csimilar\u201d state laws, and certain civil actions and state criminal prosecutions relating to sex trafficking.\nIf Section 230\u2019s liability shield does not apply, the person being sued will not automatically be held liable. Instead, it means only that courts can continue to adjudicate the case. The EO begins by stating in Section 1 the President\u2019s belief that online platforms are engaging in \u201cselective censorship,\u201d harming national discourse and restricting Americans\u2019 speech. Section 2 turns to the interpretation of Section 230(c), arguing that the \u201cscope\u201d of this immunity provision \u201cshould be clarified\u201d and the law should not be extended to platforms that \u201cengage in deceptive or pretextual actions\u201d to censor \u201ccertain viewpoints.\u201d The EO maintains that Congress intended Section 230(c) to only protect service providers that engage in \u201cGood Samaritan\u201d blocking of harmful content. Section 2 further states that providers should not be entitled to Section 230(c)(2) immunity if they remove content without acting in \u201cgood faith,\u201d including by taking \u201cdeceptive or pretextual actions (often contrary to their stated terms of service)\u201d to suppress certain viewpoints.\nSection 2 also directs the Commerce Secretary, \u201cin consultation with the Attorney General, and acting through the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA),\u201d to request the FCC to issue regulations interpreting Section 230. Among other things, the EO, perhaps in response to the Section 230 jurisprudence discussed above, specifies that FCC\u2019s proposed regulations should clarify:\n(1) \u201cthe interaction between\u201d Section 230(c)(1) and (c)(2) to explain when a service provider that cannot obtain Section 230(c)(2) immunity is also ineligible for protection under (c)(1); and (2) the meaning of \u201cgood faith\u201d in Section 230(c)(2), including whether violating terms of service or failing to provide procedural protections qualifies as bad faith.\nSection 4 of the EO instructs the FTC to \u201cconsider taking action, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to prohibit unfair or deceptive acts or practices.\u201d Specifically, the EO suggests that if platforms \u201crestrict speech in ways that do not align with those entities\u2019 public representations about\u201d how they monitor content on their sites, these acts may qualify as unfair or deceptive practices under the FTC Act. The EO also directs the FTC to consider whether complaints of \u201conline censorship\u201d received by the White House \u201callege violations of law,\u201d and whether to develop a report on these complaints.\nThe other provisions of the EO assign additional tasks to more executive departments. Section 3 of the EO requires agency review of federal spending on advertising and marketing on online platforms, and Sections 5 and 6 contain instructions for the Attorney General to establish a working group and propose federal legislation to implement the policies announced in the EO.]"}

He envisioned a globally\ninterconnected set of computers through which everyone could quickly access\ndata and programs from any site.

While at DARPA he convinced his successors\nat DARPA, Ivan Sutherland, Bob Taylor, and MIT researcher Lawrence G. Roberts,\nof the importance of this networking concept.\nLeonard Kleinrock at MIT published the first paper on packet switching theory in\nJuly 1961 and the first book on the subject in 1964. Kleinrock convinced Roberts\nof the theoretical feasibility of communications using packets rather than\ncircuits, which was a major step along the path towards computer networking.\nThe other key step was to make the computers talk together. To explore this,\nin 1965 working with Thomas Merrill, Roberts connected the TX-2 computer in\nMass. to the Q-32 in California with a low speed dial-up telephone line creating\nthe first (however small) wide-area computer network ever built. The result\nof this experiment was the realization that the time-shared computers could\nwork well together, running programs and retrieving data as necessary on the\nremote machine, but that the circuit switched telephone system was totally\ninadequate for the job. Kleinrock\u2019s conviction of the need for packet switching\nwas confirmed.\nIn late 1966 Roberts went to DARPA to develop the computer network concept\nand quickly put together his plan for the \u201cARPANET\u201d, publishing it in 1967. At the\nconference where he presented the paper, there was also a paper on a packet\nnetwork concept from the UK by Donald Davies and Roger Scantlebury of NPL.\nScantlebury told Roberts about the NPL work as well as that of Paul Baran and\nothers at RAND. The RAND group had written a paper on packet switching\nnetworks for secure voice in the military in 1964. It happened that the work at\nMIT (1961-1967), at RAND (1962-1965), and at NPL (1964-1967) had all proceeded in\nparallel without any of the researchers knowing about the other work. The word\n\u201cpacket\u201d was adopted from the work at NPL and the proposed line speed to be\nused in the ARPANET design was upgraded from 2.4 kbps to 50 kbps.5\nIn August 1968, after Roberts and the DARPA funded community had refined the\noverall structure and specifications for the ARPANET, an RFQ was released by\nDARPA for the development of one of the key components, the packet switches\ncalled Interface Message Processors (IMP\u2019s).\nThe RFQ was won in December 1968 by a group headed by Frank Heart at Bolt\nBeranek and Newman (BBN). As the BBN team worked on the IMP\u2019s with Bob\nKahn playing a major role in the overall ARPANET architectural design, the\nnetwork topology and economics were designed and optimized by Roberts working with Howard Frank and his team at Network Analysis Corporation, and the network\nmeasurement system was prepared by Kleinrock\u2019s team at UCLA.6\nDue to Kleinrock\u2019s early development of packet switching theory and his focus on analysis, design\nand measurement, his Network Measurement Center at UCLA was selected to be the first node on\nthe ARPANET.

It does not apply to Supreme Court Justices, nor has the Supreme Court formally promulgated its own ethical code. As a result, there is presently no single body of ethical canons with which the nation\u2019s highest court must comply when discharging its judicial duties. The absence of such a body of canons does not mean that Supreme Court Justices are wholly unconstrained by ethical norms and guidelines. Even though the Code does not formally apply to Supreme Court Justices, the Justices \u201cconsult the Code of Conduct\u201d and other authorities \u201cto resolve specific ethical issues.\u201d Moreover, although Congress has not enacted legislation mandating the adoption of a Supreme Court code of conduct, several statutes do impose various other ethical requirements upon the Justices. For example, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 requires federal judges, including Supreme Court Justices, to recuse themselves from particular cases under specified circumstances, such as when the judge or Justice \u201chas a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party\u201d or \u201ca financial interest in the subject matter in controversy.\u201d Congress has also directed Supreme Court Justices to comply with certain financial disclosure requirements that apply to federal officials generally. In addition, the Court has voluntarily resolved to comply with certain Judicial Conference regulations pertaining to the receipt of gifts by judicial officers, even though those regulations would otherwise not apply to Supreme Court Justices. In response to calls to mandate a code of ethics for the Supreme Court, some Members of the 117th Congress introduced the For the People Act of 2021 (H.R. 1/S. 1), which, among other things, would require \u201cthe Judicial Conference [to] issue a code of conduct, which applies to each justice \u2026 of the United States.\u201d The Supreme Court Ethics Act (H.R. 4766/S. 2512) would impose the same requirement through standalone legislation. These proposals echo similar bills from past Congresses that would have likewise subjected the Supreme Court to a code of judicial conduct.\nLegal Considerations for Congress Legislative proposals to impose a code of conduct on the Supreme Court raise an array of legal questions. The first is a question of statutory design: Which institution would Congress charge with formulating the ethical standards to govern the Justices? A legislative proposal introduced in the 115th Congress would have entrusted the Supreme Court itself with the task of \u201cpromulgat[ing] a code of ethics\u201d and would have given the Justices substantial (albeit not unbounded) freedom to design the rules that would govern their own conduct. Similarly, a House resolution introduced during the 117th Congress would express \u201cthe sense of the House of Representatives that the Justices of the Supreme Court should make themselves subject to the existing and operative ethics guidelines set out in the Code of Conduct for United States Judges, or should promulgate their own code of conduct.\u201d The For the People Act and the Supreme Court Ethics Act, by contrast, would not allow the Court to design its own ethical code; those proposals would instead grant that authority to the Judicial Conference.\nA related question is whether legislative efforts to require the Supreme Court to abide by a code of judicial conduct would violate the constitutional separation of powers. To ensure that federal judges would decide cases impartially without fear of political retaliation, the Framers of the Constitution purposefully insulated the federal judiciary from political control. Chief Justice John Roberts invoked those ideals in his 2021 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary, asserting that the courts \u201crequire ample institutional independence\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Judiciary\u2019s power to manage its internal affairs insulates courts from inappropriate political influence and is crucial to preserving public trust in its work as a separate and coequal branch of government.\u201d Some observers have argued that imposing a code of conduct upon the Supreme Court would amount to an unconstitutional legislative usurpation of judicial authority. The House resolution discussed above notes that separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary \u201cmay be compromised by extensive legislative or executive interference into that branch\u2019s functions\u201d and would thus avoid imposing any binding requirement on the Court. On the other hand, some commentators emphasize the ways that Congress may validly act with respect to the Supreme Court, for example through its authority to impeach Justices and decide whether Justices are entitled to salary increases. By extension, according to this argument, requiring the Supreme Court to adopt a code of conduct would constitute a permissible exercise of Congress\u2019s authority. Because the Supreme Court possesses the authority to determine the constitutionality of legislative enactments, the Supreme Court itself would appear to have a critical role in determining whether Congress may validly impose a code of ethical conduct upon it. It is difficult to predict whether the Court would uphold the constitutionality of a legislatively mandated code of conduct, as existing judicial precedent offers minimal guidance on how the Court might resolve this constitutional question. For instance, the Supreme Court has never explicitly decided whether the federal statute requiring Supreme Court Justices to recuse themselves from particular cases is an unconstitutional legislative encroachment upon the judiciary, nor has the Court ever directly addressed whether Congress may subject Supreme Court Justices to financial reporting requirements or limitations upon the receipt of gifts.\nDistinct from this separation-of-powers issue is the question of whether Congress may authorize the Judicial Conference\u2014which is composed almost entirely of judges from the inferior federal courts\u2014to promulgate ethical rules to govern Justices on the High Court. The Constitution explicitly contemplates that the Supreme Court will remain \u201csupreme\u201d over any \u201cinferior\u201d courts that \u201cCongress may from time to time ordain and establish,\u201d such as the federal district and appellate courts. Some observers have therefore suggested that it would be unconstitutional, or at least inappropriate, for the Judicial Conference to make rules for the Supreme Court. As one example, Senior Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy has stated that it would raise a \u201clegal problem\u201d and would be \u201cstructurally unprecedented for district and circuit judges to make rules that Supreme Court judges have to follow.\u201d A Supreme Court code of conduct could also raise practical issues to the extent that it would require Justices to disqualify themselves from particular cases. Unlike in the lower courts, where a district or circuit judge from the same court may step in to take a recused judge\u2019s place, neither retired Justices of the Supreme Court nor lower court judges may hear a case in a recused Justice\u2019s stead. The disqualification of a Supreme Court Justice from a particular case could leave the Court with an even number of Justices to decide the case and thus increase the likelihood that the Court would be evenly divided and unable to create binding precedent for future litigants. Conversely, if the other Justices would otherwise be evenly divided, it may be even more critical for a Justice with an appearance of partiality to avoid casting the deciding vote.\nIf one or more Justices refused or failed to comply with a newly created code of conduct, Congress might also encounter difficulties enforcing its tenets. The Constitution forbids Congress from reducing Supreme Court Justices\u2019 salaries or removing them from office except via the extraordinary and blunt remedy of impeachment. Thus, Congress may lack precise tools to induce recalcitrant Justices to behave ethically. Ultimately, the foregoing questions related to a Supreme Court code of conduct may be largely academic. Promulgating an ethical code for the Supreme Court could establish norms for proper judicial behavior that guide the Justices\u2019 actions. Thus, if Congress sought to compel the Supreme Court to comply with a code of judicial conduct, the Justices might simply comply with its mandates without challenging Congress\u2019s constitutional authority to impose them. The Court has often acquiesced to congressional attempts to subject Justices to specific ethical standards. For example, when Congress decided to subject the Justices to financial disclosure requirements, the Justices opted to comply with those provisions rather than challenge their constitutionality in court. Justices have likewise implicitly accepted the validity of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455, discussed above, and recused themselves pursuant to that statute without questioning whether Congress possesses the constitutional authority to enact a judicial disqualification statute.\n", "full_prompt": "Question: What are the pros and cons of the Supreme Court having a Code of Conduct?\n\nSystem Instruction: Answer using only the information provided below.

As the original cryptocurrency, bitcoin has spurred an entirely new asset class that now has over $1 trillion in market capitalization. With the approval of 11 spot bitcoin ETFs in January 2024, traditional investors have an even easier way to invest in bitcoin.\n\nWhat Is a Spot Bitcoin ETF?\nOn January 10, 2024, the SEC approved 11 new spot bitcoin ETFs.\n\nETFs, or exchange-traded funds, are a type of security that tracks the underlying performance of a collection of assets or commodities. A spot bitcoin ETF is an exchange-traded fund that tracks the spot, or current price of bitcoin. By holding an equivalent amount of bitcoin to back every share of the ETF that is sold, the fund is actually backed by bitcoin itself.\n\nConsidering the hoops you have to jump through to own bitcoin\u2014exchange accounts, digital wallets, private keys, network transfers, etc.\u2014a spot bitcoin ETF is one of the easiest ways to add bitcoin exposure to your portfolio.\n\nSpot ETFs, such as the new spot bitcoin ETFs, allow for shares of the fund to be created or redeemed based on market demand.\n\nIn this way, a spot bitcoin ETF allows investors to gain exposure to the current price of bitcoin without having to hold the asset itself.\n\nThis is in contrast to bitcoin futures ETFs, which were approved for trading by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in October 2021 and can only trade bitcoin futures.\n\nFutures are complex derivatives instruments that track potential future prices of the underlying asset.\n\nHow Do Spot Bitcoin ETFs Work?\nSpot bitcoin ETFs purchase a select amount of bitcoins that are held in a secure digital wallet by a custodian. These custodians offer bitcoin storage in a secure vault. Most of these vaults are\u2014as crypto insiders call\u2014air gapped in \u201ccold storage,\u201d which means the bitcoins\u2019 keys are stored offline and cannot be accessed through the internet.\n\nThe ETFs then issue shares that represent the bitcoins held by the fund. These shares are priced to reflect the current spot price of bitcoin and can be traded on traditional stock exchanges.\n\nSpot bitcoin ETFs make it easier for retail investors and traders to buy and sell an asset tied to the current value of bitcoin without needing to hold bitcoin itself. They also allow investors seeking exposure to bitcoin in retirement accounts to have a much simpler option than opening a self-directed IRA that could hold bitcoin directly.\n\nHow Does a Spot ETF Maintain Its Price?\n\nThe price of a spot ETF can depart from the actual value of the underlying asset.\n\nTo bring the fund back in line with the asset\u2019s actual value, authorized participants, otherwise known as APs, are allowed to create or redeem large blocks of shares. APs are typically large financial institutions that profit from the arbitrage opportunity presented when an ETF\u2019s price is higher or lower than the underlying asset\u2019s value.\n\n11 Spot Bitcoin ETFs\nHere are the 11 SEC-approved Spot Bitcoin ETFs as of January 31, 2024:\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETF\tExpense Ratio\tFee Waiver\nARK 21Shares Bitcoin ETF (ARKB)\n0.21%\n0% fee for six months (or until $1 billion in assets)\nBitwise Bitcoin ETF (BITB)\n0.20%\n0% fee for six months (or until $1 billion in assets)\nFidelity Wise Origin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC)\n0.25%\nFees waived until July 31, 2024\nFranklin Bitcoin ETF (EZBC)\n0.19%\n0% fee until August 2, 2024 (or until $10 billion in assets)\nGrayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)\n1.50%\nNo fee waiver\nHashdex Bitcoin ETF (DEFI)*\n0.90%\nNo fee waiver\nInvesco Galaxy Bitcoin ETF (BTCO)\n0.25%\n0% fee for six months (or until $5 billion in assets)\niShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)\n0.25%\n0.12% fee for 12 months (or until $5 billion in assets)\nValkyrie Bitcoin Fund (BRRR)\n0.25%\n0% fee for three months\nVanEck Bitcoin Trust (HODL)\n0.25%\nNo fee waiver\nSee More\n* The Hashdex Bitcoin Futures ETF (DEFI) will convert to a spot bitcoin ETF at a later date.\n\nNow That They\u2019re Here, What\u2019s the Future of Spot Bitcoin ETFs?\nFor years, the SEC had rejected all applications for a spot bitcoin ETF, with over 20 thumbs down between 2018 and 2023.\n\nThe SEC\u2019s approval of 11 spot bitcoin ETFs on January 10 marks a shift in how regulators treat cryptocurrencies. A flurry of new applications has been sent to the SEC for approval, suggesting even more spot bitcoin ETFs may be coming.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that just because spot bitcoin ETFs have been approved, that does not mean the SEC is certain to approve additional crypto ETFs.\n\nGary Gensler, chairman of the SEC, said in the SEC\u2019s announcement of the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, \u201cImportantly, today\u2019s Commission action is cabined to ETPs holding one non-security commodity, bitcoin. It should in no way signal the Commission\u2019s willingness to approve listing standards for crypto asset securities.\u201d\n\nWill Spot Bitcoin ETFs Affect the Price of Bitcoin?\nIn the short term, more investors will find it easier to invest in bitcoin through these spot ETFs. This could mean more demand for bitcoin, as funds purchase from crypto exchanges to meet the demand of the spot ETFs.\n\nBitcoin\u2019s price was already rising in the weeks leading up to the spot bitcoin ETF announcement\u2014and a \u201csell the news\u201d moment happened in the wake of the approval. Many bitcoin holders became sellers, with the price of bitcoin dropping over 10% in just a few weeks.\n\nOver the long term, however, demand could increase for Bitcoin, as retirement plans, 401(k) plans and financial advisors start offering spot bitcoin ETFs as a way to diversify portfolios into \u201calternative assets.\u201d\n\n\u201cI personally believe that it will positively impact Bitcoin\u2019s price because of increased adoption, easier access to \u2018normies\u2019 and increased liquidity in the marketplace,\u201d says Marko Zlatic, founder of Whiteboard Finance. \u201cSince the Bitcoin protocol dictates a finite supply of 21 million bitcoin ever, this should drive prices up over time, as long as there is adequate demand.\u201d\n\nRisks of Investing in Spot Bitcoin ETFs\nInvestors should understand the risk of investing in a spot bitcoin ETF before allocating any funds toward one.\n\n\u201cInvestors should approach cautiously and look at previous price movements of bitcoin to make sure they can stomach the volatility before they dive in,\u201d says Christopher Johns, founder and wealth advisor at Spark Wealth Advisors, LLC.\n\nGold had a similar trajectory when spot gold ETFs were introduced. The assets under management, or AUM, of spot gold ETFs quickly rose to about $1 billion. Since then, total holdings have grown to over $50 billion.\n\nThis\u2014along with other macroeconomic factors\u2014has helped push the price of gold up to new highs.\n\nSpot Bitcoin ETFs: Pros And Cons\n\nPros\nBitcoin legitimacy. With the approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, the original cryptocurrency is now seen as a more legitimate asset class. Investors from all walks of life can gain exposure to bitcoin in almost any type of investment account they own, including individual retirement accounts, or IRAs, and 401(k)s.\nMore liquidity. With ETFs buying and selling large blocks of bitcoin based on demand, this could increase liquidity and help stabilize prices over the long term.\nIncrease prices. While a spot bitcoin ETF does not directly affect the price of bitcoin, the increased demand and purchasing of bitcoin by these ETFs could boost the price over time.\nLower trading fees. With more adoption and ease of access through a spot ETF, investors may be able to access bitcoin with lower trading fees than some crypto exchanges.\n\nCons\nMore regulation. Spot bitcoin ETFs are highly-regulated securities that are now tied to the price of bitcoin. Any regulatory actions against bitcoin could affect the price of spot bitcoin ETFs\u2014and bitcoin itself\u2014as well.\nInvestors don\u2019t take custody of bitcoin. While investing in a spot bitcoin ETF gives you exposure to the price of bitcoin, you can\u2019t take custody of the asset itself. \u201c[You\u2019re] trusting a third party custodian to \u2018HODL\u2019 your bitcoin. Not your keys, not your bitcoin,\u201d Zlatic says.\nAnnual fees. While trading spot bitcoin ETFs might cost less in the short term, the annual expense ratios may make it more expensive to own versus purchasing and storing bitcoin yourself.\nVolatility. While spot bitcoin ETFs will help increase bitcoin adoption, it is still a volatile asset that wildly fluctuates in price, which can hurt investors who aren\u2019t prepared for the risk involved in owning bitcoin.\nAlternatives to Spot Bitcoin ETFs\nWhile investing in a spot bitcoin ETF can give you direct exposure to the price of bitcoin, it\u2019s not the only way to invest in bitcoin. Here are a few alternatives to consider:\n\nPurchase bitcoin directly. If you want to own the actual asset yourself, you can purchase bitcoin from an online exchange. This gives you the ability to own bitcoin\u2014or at least a portion of bitcoin\u2014and take it into custody. There is a higher barrier to entry to owning bitcoin, as you\u2019ll need to create a crypto exchange account, open a digital wallet and perhaps even transfer your bitcoin keys to a hardware wallet for safekeeping.\nBitcoin futures ETF. Bitcoin futures ETFs have been around for a while, although they operate a bit differently than a spot ETF. These ETFs do not hold any bitcoin and only hold futures contracts based on the future price of bitcoin. This makes them potentially even more volatile than bitcoin itself.\nBitcoin mining stocks.

All we need is a smartphone with an internet connection.\n Mobile phones have become part of our daily lives and besides communication, we have available a vast variety of apps that can make our daily life a lot easier. Though the cost of app development is rising, the number of apps in app stores is increasing. Some of these apps had been optimized for mobile apps stores so that we can find them easier.\n However, being in the business of making apps, we must question what\u2019s the impact of mobile phones in our lives and society? In this article, we\u2019ll look into what are the positive and negative effects of using mobile phones on a daily basis.\n Negative effects of mobile phones in our lives\n 1. Waste of time\n As much we love what nowadays smartphones can do for us, this technology also has a downside.

One day, that\u2019s right!\n \n\n 2. Addiction\n Phones addiction has a name: nomophobia, the fear of being out of cell phone contact. Therefore, not just spending too much time on our devices is a sign of addiction, but the fear of not having them on us as well. Like any other form of addiction, studies show that people that are addicted to their phones often show signs of depression, anxiety, and other forms of mental health problems.\n \n\n 3. Distraction\n Another study, this time from Florida State University, says that smartphones notifications can impair our concentration, even being short in duration they cause enough of a distraction to affect your ability to focus on a given task, decreasing your performance by prompting task-irrelevant thoughts and mind-wandering. This can be very dangerous in some specific situations, like driving, for instance, a simple notification can cause really serious accidents.\n \n\n 4. Affecting social skills\n Besides the problems mentioned above, it also has a huge impact on people\u2019s social lives, people are getting more disconnected from the real world, they put their phones ahead of human interaction, it\u2019s getting harder to see people talking to each other in public places, they\u2019re always too busy with their mobile devices, checking notifications, sending messages or just sharing a new video.

Communication \n Besides the dark part of mobile technology, in the form of phones, tablets, and notebooks, is making our lives better than ever before.

Sharing seemingly trivial information like where we are, what we are doing, and what that looks like significantly impacts our relationships with friends and loved ones.\n Mobile technology has given a voice to those otherwise cut off from the world during cataclysmic events. That voice can reach out for help when local tragedy strikes, and for the first time, these people are not alone. They can share their plight using mobile communication through text, voice, and, most importantly, images, and bring about real change.\n 2. Daily utilities \n Mobile phones have changed the way we live our lives. Now, not only can they help us stay connected with friends and family over social media or talk to someone on a video call without paying for data usage, but they also make everything from booking hotels and cabs to capturing memories easier than ever before thanks to their built-in cameras! We have more information in our hands than at any time in history. It has become second nature to quickly lookup helpful resources for whatever activity we need to do. Our gadgets can even anticipate what information we need and present it to us when it is most useful.\n 3. Healthcare services\n While mobile phones has improved our daily lives on many levels, it has profoundly raised the quality of life for many. Healthcare is an area that has embraced mobile technology, and while it\u2019s still in the infancy of adoption of this technology, it is already making profound improvements for many.\n Healthcare providers get a quick medical opinion, through medical apps like this one, or they can review home medical tests from anywhere and make crucial changes to the patient\u2019s care. Medical staff members can receive pacemaker tests remotely using a phone and change the programming of the device to address changes in the patient\u2019s condition. Doctors can see intricate diagnostic images on phones and find conditions that need immediate treatment, all while the patient is comfortable at home.\n \n\n Villagers in third-world countries who have no local healthcare can be diagnosed and have treatment prescribed by distant healthcare providers. Patients in areas experiencing significant problems with counterfeit medications can use a phone at the point of purchase to confirm if a medication is legitimate. This is saving lives and improving healthcare every day for those affected.\n Children with ailments such as autism are using tablets to help them focus and communicate with those around them. Patients recovering from strokes and brain injuries are using tablets to great effect in their recoveries. Patients of all ages are using mobile devices to communicate with healthcare providers and loved ones as they never could before.\n People born without hearing are having implants that can be programmed by wireless technology that allows them to hear their children speak for the very first time. Text messaging on phones has made a tremendous impact on communication for the deaf.\n Diabetics can monitor their glucose level and have it wirelessly transferred to a small insulin pump that injects just the right amount to keep them where they need to be.\n Blind individuals can use mobile phones to not only improve their lives but also help achieve an incredible level of independence. Not only do these phones speak to the blind so they know what is displayed on the screen, but they also have software that can safely guide them out in busy cities.

", "user_request": "What are two trends in Sudan's banking regulations that need to be encouraged in order to make the actual financial stability match the health indicated by the banking system's EM-Z score model results?", "context_document": "The analysis of the statistical results obtained from the univariate financial ratios model and Ahmed (2003) model indicate that the Sudanese banks are not financially sound. The liquidity ratios show that there has been deterioration in the liquidity position of the banking industry in Sudan. Since banks depend heavily on lending to generate revenues, the shortage in liquidity weakens their financing capability, which in turn negatively affects their earnings. Furthermore, the lack of liquidity may force banks either to sell assets or pay a premium on borrowed funds. The indebtedness measures reveal that banks are highly leveraged and thus are of high risk. This asserts that the banks will find it hard to get further financing from both national and international financial markets. This high credit risk also suggests that the bank is no longer attractive for the depositors. This is confirmed by the deposits structure of banks, which are mainly demand ones. This result is expected because the Marabaha margin, which indicates the return on investment deposits, almost remains fixed at 12% over the period examined and this percentage is far below inflation levels. This explains the shrinkage in investment deposits through time and signalizes the inability of\r\nbanks to earn satisfactory profits. Additionally, the profitability measures indicate that banks do generate sufficient profits from their operations. Due to the high level of inflation, the bank's managements find it difficult to pay dividends and also secure internal fund to sustain any growth strategy. The turnover financial metrics indicate that\r\nthe management of banks are inefficient in employing their working capital to generate revenues and are generally not optimizing the utilization of assets. This inefficient use of assets justifies the low level of profitability realized by those banks.\r\nThe results obtained from the analysis of the depositors\u2019 confidence index indicate that the depositors slightly trust the banks operating in Sudan. This finding is highly expected as the previous studies provide evidence that factors such as slumping economy, turbulent political climate, high inflation, inconsistent policies and regulations, weak transparency, undercapitalization of banks, which are all prevailing in Sudan, negatively affect the confidence of depositors in their banks. This weak trust implies that the depositors are not sure that their banks can safely secure their deposits and thus are skeptical that their banks are able to pay them back their money. The low confidence in banks also indicates that the depositors are doubtful about the competency, integrity and transparency of their banks\u2019 management. Further, the undercapitalization of banks triggers a fear of banks failure and thus loss of depositors\u2019\r\nmoney. Additionally, the inconsistent and ever-changing government policies, especially the monetary and credit ones, the weak legal and regulatory systems and laws, the deteriorating economic conditions of the country and the political instability and erratic country foreign relationships, signal that banks will suffer from financial difficulties in\r\nthe near future and initiate a strong tendency towards cash withdrawal from banks.\r\nThe analysis also shows that the privately-owned banks do not perform better than the government-owned ones. This result may be attributed to the fact that the government-owned banks are supported by the government. That is to say, the government usually injects funds in those banks that are in bad need for financing.

Regulators also need to set rules that protect depositors and safeguard their money.", "full_prompt": "Use only the provided information to generate responses, do not use any information not found within the question and context given. \n\nWhat are two trends in Sudan's banking regulations that need to be encouraged in order to make the actual financial stability match the health indicated by the banking system's EM-Z score model results?\n\nThe analysis of the statistical results obtained from the univariate financial ratios model and Ahmed (2003) model indicate that the Sudanese banks are not financially sound. The liquidity ratios show that there has been deterioration in the liquidity position of the banking industry in Sudan. Since banks depend heavily on lending to generate revenues, the shortage in liquidity weakens their financing capability, which in turn negatively affects their earnings. Furthermore, the lack of liquidity may force banks either to sell assets or pay a premium on borrowed funds. The indebtedness measures reveal that banks are highly leveraged and thus are of high risk. This asserts that the banks will find it hard to get further financing from both national and international financial markets. This high credit risk also suggests that the bank is no longer attractive for the depositors. This is confirmed by the deposits structure of banks, which are mainly demand ones. This result is expected because the Marabaha margin, which indicates the return on investment deposits, almost remains fixed at 12% over the period examined and this percentage is far below inflation levels. This explains the shrinkage in investment deposits through time and signalizes the inability of\r\nbanks to earn satisfactory profits. Additionally, the profitability measures indicate that banks do generate sufficient profits from their operations. Due to the high level of inflation, the bank's managements find it difficult to pay dividends and also secure internal fund to sustain any growth strategy. The turnover financial metrics indicate that\r\nthe management of banks are inefficient in employing their working capital to generate revenues and are generally not optimizing the utilization of assets. This inefficient use of assets justifies the low level of profitability realized by those banks.\r\nThe results obtained from the analysis of the depositors\u2019 confidence index indicate that the depositors slightly trust the banks operating in Sudan. This finding is highly expected as the previous studies provide evidence that factors such as slumping economy, turbulent political climate, high inflation, inconsistent policies and regulations, weak transparency, undercapitalization of banks, which are all prevailing in Sudan, negatively affect the confidence of depositors in their banks. This weak trust implies that the depositors are not sure that their banks can safely secure their deposits and thus are skeptical that their banks are able to pay them back their money. The low confidence in banks also indicates that the depositors are doubtful about the competency, integrity and transparency of their banks\u2019 management. Further, the undercapitalization of banks triggers a fear of banks failure and thus loss of depositors\u2019\r\nmoney. Additionally, the inconsistent and ever-changing government policies, especially the monetary and credit ones, the weak legal and regulatory systems and laws, the deteriorating economic conditions of the country and the political instability and erratic country foreign relationships, signal that banks will suffer from financial difficulties in\r\nthe near future and initiate a strong tendency towards cash withdrawal from banks.\r\nThe analysis also shows that the privately-owned banks do not perform better than the government-owned ones. This result may be attributed to the fact that the government-owned banks are supported by the government. That is to say, the government usually injects funds in those banks that are in bad need for financing. The same logic applies for the better performance of the specialized banks as compared to the nonspecialized ones. The specialized banks are highly propped by the government. For instance, the Central bank has decreased the legal monetary reserve required\r\nfor the banks that provide finance to agricultural, industrial and mineral mining projects, in an attempt to boost exports. With regards to the comparison of the financial health of the foreign banks with that of the national banks, the analysis indicates that the financial health of both groups is similar, which led to the reasoning that the foreign banks have not benefited from their developed expertise, overseas existence and access the international financial market to strengthen their financial positions.\r\nThe contrary conclusion arrived at by the employment of EM Z-score model that banks operating in Sudan are generally healthy and financially viable may be in the context that, though the banking sector in Sudan is not financially sound, within the near future of two years most of the banks will not be bankrupt.\r\nSeveral practical implications can be derived from the results of this study.

IT leaders should understand the following\nreasons why legacy systems should be prioritized for modernization.\n1. The system creates an unacceptable security risk\nMany IT teams can't patch some legacy systems because vendors don't release new patches. Other systems have significant security.\n\nvulnerabilities IT can't address for another reason.\n\nAny such system with \"security vulnerabiltties that could bring the [organization] to its knees should be a high priority for replacement,\u201d said\nDave Powner, executive director of the Center for Data-Driven Policy at Mitre Corp., a nonprofit research and development organization,\nbased in McLean, Va., that provides technical and cybersecurity support to U.S. government agencies.\n2.

The system costs too much to maintain\nAl systems come with run costs. In some cases, a system\u2019s maintenance costs might exceed its business value, including the cost of\nmodernizing the system.\nExcessive run costs draw resources away from pursuing innovation and new opportunities, Patel said.\n\nCIOs need to do that math and know when they're approaching or have gone past that point so they can take appropriate action.\n5. The system is at a high risk of failure\nSystems with no vendor support, that depend on obsolete programming languages or are highly customized with scant documentation and\nno remaining institutional knowledge of its buildout are highly fragile. Organizations could have a difficult time recovering if the system\nshould fail.\nFor example, some businesses have needed help with IT systems but couldn'tfind IT talent to service the systems. It's best to replace those\nsystems before that happens to ensure business continuity.\n3 reasons to maintain legacy systems\n\nCompanies can maintain legacy systems under the right circumstances. Here are three reasons to maintain a legacy system that IT leaders\nshould understand.\n\n1. The system has an acceptable level of risk\nAsystem no longer supported by a vendor or built on an obsolete programming language does have security vulnerabilities. But it might not\ncreate unnecessary risks.\nFor example, a company might rely on the system for a noncritical back-office function. There would be minimal effects on daily operations if\nthe system failed.\nOr the CIO might have or could easily access the talent needed to keep it running at a reasonable cost.\n\nIn such cases, the CIO might reasonably opt to make modernizing that system a lower priority.\n2. The system still supports the organization's needs\nAsystem that meets the organization's needs, while not hindering its ability to pursue new competitive opportunities, is a strong candidate to\nstay in place.\nOrganizations might do themselves a disservice by replacing legacy systems with modern versions they're not ready to use or optimize,\nPatel said.\n\nFor example, replacing an existing system with a modern app featuring Al might seem like a good strategy. Still, a company needs to have\nthe maturity required to use the Al component successfully to get ROI that justifies the modernization.\n3.

These costs include the opportunity cost of time spent searching, as well as associated expenditures such as driving, telephone calls, computer fees, and magazine subscriptions. Similarly, sellers face search costs in identifying qualified buyers for their products, such as market research, advertising, and sales calls\r\nSeveral Internet-based technologies lower buyer search costs. Many sites help buyers identify appropriate seller offerings: for example, search engines like Alta Vista, Yahoo!, or Google.com; business directories like the one provided by Yahoo!; or specialized product and price comparison agents for specific markets, such as Pricewatch and Computer ESP for computers and components, Expedia and Travelocity for airline tickets and other travel products, Shopper.com and Yahoo Shopping for electronics, and Dealtime for books and music. Online agents like the one provided by R-U-Sure.com monitor consumer behavior and help buyers identify the most desirable prices and product offerings without requiring them to take specific action. Internet technology can also lower the cost to buyers of acquiring information about the reputations of market participants. Such reputations may be provided as part of the marketplace (for example, on eBay), or through specialized intermediaries, such as Bizrate, which rates retailers on specific attributes (like service, product quality, and delivery promptness) by surveying consumers who have recently purchased products from these retailers.\r\nThe Internet lowers seller search costs as well, by allowing sellers to communicate product information cost-effectively to potential buyers, and by offering sellers new ways to reach buyers through targeted advertising and one-on-one marketing.\r\nBy reducing search costs on both sides of the market, it appears likely that buyers will be able to consider more product offerings and will identify and purchase products that better match their needs, with a resulting increase in economic efficiency. But the reduction in search costs combined with new capabilities of information technology can set off more complex market dynamics, too.\r\n\r\nThe Impact of Lower Search and Information Costs on Market Competition\r\nIt may seem clear that lower search and information costs should push markets toward a greater degree of price competition, and this outcome is certainly plausible, especially for homogeneous goods. On the other hand, online retailers can use Internet technology to provide differentiated and customized products, and thus avoid competing purely on price. I will explore these possibilities in turn.\r\n\r\nThe Benefits to Buyers of Greater Price Competition\r\nLower search costs in digital markets will make it easier for buyers to find low-cost sellers, and thus will promote price competition among sellers. This effect will be most pronounced in commodity markets, where lowering buyers\u2019 search costs may result in intensive price competition, wiping out any extraordinary seller profits. It may also be significant in markets where products are differentiated, reducing the monopoly power enjoyed by sellers and leading to lower seller profits while increasing efficiency and total welfare (Bakos, 1997).\r\nSome online markets may have lower barriers to entry or smaller efficient scales, thus leading to a larger number of sellers at equilibrium, and correspondingly lower prices and profits. In particular, certain small-scale sellers may have a brighter future in a wired world if they can identify appropriate niches, because they can more easily be searched for and discovered, as search costs online are less determined by geography.\r\nIt may thus be expected that online markets will have more intense price competition, resulting in lower profits as well as the passing to consumers of savings from lower cost structures.

If you can't answer the question with information extracted from the context block only, output 'I can't answer due to lack of context'.\n\nReducing Search Costs For Buyers and Sellers\r\nBuyers face search costs in obtaining and processing information about the prices and product features of seller offerings. These costs include the opportunity cost of time spent searching, as well as associated expenditures such as driving, telephone calls, computer fees, and magazine subscriptions. Similarly, sellers face search costs in identifying qualified buyers for their products, such as market research, advertising, and sales calls\r\nSeveral Internet-based technologies lower buyer search costs. Many sites help buyers identify appropriate seller offerings: for example, search engines like Alta Vista, Yahoo!, or Google.com; business directories like the one provided by Yahoo!; or specialized product and price comparison agents for specific markets, such as Pricewatch and Computer ESP for computers and components, Expedia and Travelocity for airline tickets and other travel products, Shopper.com and Yahoo Shopping for electronics, and Dealtime for books and music. Online agents like the one provided by R-U-Sure.com monitor consumer behavior and help buyers identify the most desirable prices and product offerings without requiring them to take specific action. Internet technology can also lower the cost to buyers of acquiring information about the reputations of market participants. Such reputations may be provided as part of the marketplace (for example, on eBay), or through specialized intermediaries, such as Bizrate, which rates retailers on specific attributes (like service, product quality, and delivery promptness) by surveying consumers who have recently purchased products from these retailers.\r\nThe Internet lowers seller search costs as well, by allowing sellers to communicate product information cost-effectively to potential buyers, and by offering sellers new ways to reach buyers through targeted advertising and one-on-one marketing.\r\nBy reducing search costs on both sides of the market, it appears likely that buyers will be able to consider more product offerings and will identify and purchase products that better match their needs, with a resulting increase in economic efficiency. But the reduction in search costs combined with new capabilities of information technology can set off more complex market dynamics, too.\r\n\r\nThe Impact of Lower Search and Information Costs on Market Competition\r\nIt may seem clear that lower search and information costs should push markets toward a greater degree of price competition, and this outcome is certainly plausible, especially for homogeneous goods. On the other hand, online retailers can use Internet technology to provide differentiated and customized products, and thus avoid competing purely on price. I will explore these possibilities in turn.\r\n\r\nThe Benefits to Buyers of Greater Price Competition\r\nLower search costs in digital markets will make it easier for buyers to find low-cost sellers, and thus will promote price competition among sellers. This effect will be most pronounced in commodity markets, where lowering buyers\u2019 search costs may result in intensive price competition, wiping out any extraordinary seller profits. It may also be significant in markets where products are differentiated, reducing the monopoly power enjoyed by sellers and leading to lower seller profits while increasing efficiency and total welfare (Bakos, 1997).\r\nSome online markets may have lower barriers to entry or smaller efficient scales, thus leading to a larger number of sellers at equilibrium, and correspondingly lower prices and profits. In particular, certain small-scale sellers may have a brighter future in a wired world if they can identify appropriate niches, because they can more easily be searched for and discovered, as search costs online are less determined by geography.\r\nIt may thus be expected that online markets will have more intense price competition, resulting in lower profits as well as the passing to consumers of savings from lower cost structures. For instance, online shoppers may expect a 20 to 30 percent discount for items normally priced $30-500 (Tedeschi, 1999).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\nHow does lowering the search costs in digital markets impact the price competition of online retailers?"}

{"system_instruction": "Use only the details found in the text above to inform your answer.", "user_request": "Which composers are credited with creating and expanding the framework for aleatory composition in its early days? ", "context_document": "8 \r\nIn section 4 we discussed various tendencies that began to emerge during and after the phase of punctual music. Around 1956 these became much clearer and enabled composers to draw certain conclusions. \r\n1. The statistical approach to music came to the foreground. The primary consideration became the ordering of higher categories of form rather than the organisation of detail. This was already indicated by use of the term 'group' to refer to what is really the smallest unit, characterised by the detailed effect of pitch, duration, timbre, etc.; within the group, however, a certain freedom was possible without encroaching on the characteristic of the group. This freedom was also evident in an easier use of interval proportions than was ever conceivable in classical dodecaphony. It was no longer a question of 'this and this' or 'so and so many notes, but of a certain degree of density. Density, register, direction of movement, degree of periodicity and many other concepts emerged as aspects of music that could be ordered serially. Attention to elements of detail made way for a more global determination, and thus for the concept of form. \r\n2. In this process the series became increasingly neutral, functioning more and more as a regulatory factor. Proportions became decisive: a 3rd from a pitch series is a 5/4 proportion that can be manifest in any other musical ele- ment. In so far as pitch series were still employed, they likewise had a neutral character and were naturally no longer bound to the twelve notes. The series in Gruppen still had twelve notes, and indeed a pronounced shape of its own, presumably to attain large proportional contrasts in the macrofield. The Klavierst\u00fccke I-IV however, dating from 1954, retained only the rudiments of the 12-note series. In the second and third pieces, respectively, they are as fol- lows: \r\nNono's Il Canto sospeso (1956) was based on the all-interval series shown in \r\nExample 109. Something similiar occurred in Messiaen's Livre d'Orgue (see Example 16). \r\n3. The outstanding scholar Gy\u00f6rgi Ligeti, who has already been mentioned, introduced the concept of interval permeability. In section 4 we have already observed how the interval, and indeed other musical elements too, lost its own existence by being taken up in higher, statistically determinable quanti- ties.4 This desensitisation evoked new problems and new possibilities. The music became manifest in layers, no longer characterised by the detail but by a global 'material state' (rough, granular, smooth, etc.). Such layers could be combined, and exact synchronisation was obviously no longer relevant. Indeed, exactness acquired a certain margin: synchronism was not essential, but rather the spatial distribution of 'material states'. Something of the sort had already been achieved by Messiaen, among others, with his modality, in which a certain indifferentiation likewise arose in terms of sequence of notes and intervals. In serial music composers went further: different tempos were combinable, and the new concept of field magnitude emerged, heralding another important phase in new music that is usually described as aleatory composition. \r\n9 \r\nThis did not appear out of thin air. Directly after the rigorously punctual style of the Structures, Boulez reacted with his Marteau sans Ma\u00eetre, completed in 1954, in which the tempo in particular fluctuates through the many changes, directions such as 'tempo et nuances tr\u00e8s instables', etc. The work breathes a freedom and suppleness that reminds one immediately of Debussy. The many short notes, separate or clustered, and the irrational values create a sort of written-out rubato (see Example 35). This differentiation, which was also manifest, though somewhat differently, in Stockhausen's work of the same period, moved the latter to express the following thoughts (freely cited): 'An inaccuracy factor arises in performance. The areas within which this factor is \r\n\r\nmanifest are time fields, and their dimensions are field magnitudes. In the past too this margin existed in performance, but was coincidental. Now we wish to capture these inaccuracies functionally. A series of field magnitudes, rather than a traditional series of fixated durations, can now be determinant.' \r\nThis meant the abandonment of our quantitative system of fixed-value notation and the creation of a way of indicating the boundaries within which indeterminacy may occur, something that could be done in many ways. In Example 67 Boulez used the sign to indicate the boundaries within which a number of short notes may be freely placed. Stockhausen developed a different method to indicate action duration, based on the principle that note duration is no longer counted, but determined during performance by means of a particular action prescribed by the composer. Thus, the time between two notes, for instance, may depend on that required by the player to move his hand, on the degree of complexity of a given touch or pedal movement, or on breathing considerations, etc. Once again, such physiolog- ical reactions had always existed; but Stockhausen wished to incorporate them functionally in his music. Although it sounds paradoxical, all this revealed a desire to control musical elements that cannot be accurately com- mitted to paper. It is clear, therefore, that it was not a question of the absolute values of these elements, but of their mutual relationships. \r\nThe rapidity of these innovations was remarkable. While the correspon- dence between macro- and micro-areas discussed in the previous sections was still hardly formulated, new territory was being explored. And each discovery required years of elaboration! Perhaps it was this hurried course of events that caused problems in Stockhausen's first composition in this field. Let us take a closer look at the Klavierst\u00fcck XI of 1957. \r\nNineteen groups are written down on a large piece of paper, all of very dif- ferent length and without any suggestion of sequence; some are illustrated in Example 110. According to the composer each group is in itself the result of serial ordering, based on different series to organise field magnitude propor- tions. We must take his word for it, since we have arrived at a situation in which serial manipulation can no longer be reconstructed without the help of the composer. Some groups include the familiar notes in small print that are to be played as fast as possible'. Action duration is taken into account, for the composer says that 'difficult chords and large leaps with one hand obviously require more time than simple chords and smaller intervals'. Although the notes in normal print have the customary quantitive notation of duration, an unexpected element is to play a role. Stockhausen prescribes the following: the performer is to glance unintentionally at the page and play the first group that catches his eye, in the tempo, dynamics and touch of his choice. The lat- ter, however, are classified by the composer beforehand: there are six tempos, for instance, ranging from tempo I, very fast, to tempo 6, very slow. Subsequently, the player's eye is caught unintentionally (without any attempt to connect particular groups) by another group which he now plays in accor- \r\n\r\ndance with directions given at the end of the previous group. Each group can be connected to any of the other eighteen, and all nineteen groups can there- fore be performed in the prescribed degrees of tempo, dynamics and touch. The characteristics of all groups are therefore variable within the chosen boundaries. The field magnitude of a following group is determined by indi- cations at the end of the preceding one. \r\nA performance does not necessarily include all the groups. If a group is repeated, indications are given for small modifications in the second render- ing, usually in the form of somewhat elementary octave transpositions. If a group occurs for a third time, it also brings one of the possible realisations of the whole piece to an end. The work is an example of open form, without direction or termination. The groups are spatially juxtaposed and can be com- bined in countless ways. In the many commentaries on this composition two aspects have been neglected or confused. \r\n1. The action duration - a decidedly positive element. Instead of \u2018counting' with a margin of inaccuracy, a spontaneous reaction arises, a realisation of the time structure at the moment of the action itself. Such music can therefore no longer be approached from the score, since the time structure is now deter- mined by the perception time of the performer himself, which is inseparable from physical reactions and abilities. Such freedom is therefore ostensible. Nothing is added to an existing structure (unlike jazz or basso continuo tech- nique); on the contrary, the player remains entirely bound to the composer's directions, but he becomes involved right down to his physical reactions. Notice that this action duration takes place within the boundaries of each group. The mutual bond between the groups is quite a different matter; it is created by means of what one could call: \r\n2. the spontaneous decision. The player is required to glance 'unintention- ally' and to link the very first group that catches his eye with the preceding one. The word 'chance' crops up here and is indeed to stay with us, whether relevant or not. But it is not a question of chance, for the performer may choose from no more than the 18 options determined by the composer. All possibilities are already enclosed in the concept. At best there is mention of an unconsidered decision at the last moment - freedom, indeed, but a free- dom without sense. The actual time experience of the action duration is absent, as is the considered decision of the composition process. It is a free- dom that is only possible thanks to another concept of form, that of the open form without causality. These new concepts of form have already been dis- cussed at several points, especially in relation to the theory of musical space. In this light Stockhausen's Klavierst\u00fcck XI is hardly new, but merely a confir- mation of a concept of form already found in Debussy. \r\nStockhausen's step was to transfer choice from the composer to the per- former; instead of a single notated version, many realisations of a piece become feasible. \r\n\r\n- \r\nBoulez was the first to recognise the real problem of the Klavierst\u00fcck XI. In the same period, but independently of Stockhausen, he worked on his Third Piano Sonata; at the same time he was confronted by the work of Mallarm\u00e9, whose literary preoccupations ran remarkably parallel despite the great dis- parity in time. In Boulez, too, the player gains a more important role, but this does nothing \r\nthe composer believes - to change the problem of form. He felt the necessity to develop a new form that adapts to the material available to the serial composer, which was constantly becoming more elastic. But form to Boulez was something more than the mosaics of Stockhausen's music, which were really nothing other than constantly changing combinations from millions of options. If the performer was free to choose, then his choice should preferably be made after some consideration, and with only a very lim- ited number of possibilities that were precisely determined by the composer. \r\nAn example is the overall structure of the Sonata (comprising five move- ments in the first concept): Antiphonie, Trope, Constellation, Strophe, S\u00e9quence. The sequence of the movements is free, providing that Constellation is always in the middle. The internal structure reflects the same approach. One of the movements, Trope, has four components: two so-called structures complexes (Parenth\u00e8se, Commentaire) and two structures simples (Glose, Texte). In the 'complex structures' the performer is again free to include or omit certain additional variants (given between brackets). \r\nThe sequence of these components is indicated in an ingenious manner. The unnumbered pages of the score are in a ring binder, and the player may begin where he wishes. The sequence is therefore directed - we usually read from front to back - but not predetermined (Boulez speaks of a forme circu- laire). There are normally four options, therefore, depending on the starting point: \r\n- \r\nP, C, C, \r\nG, T \r\nG, T, P G, T, P C \r\nT, P, C, G \r\nBut since the Commentaire section is included twice, four other possibilities become available, depending on where this section is placed (it may only be performed once); this can be represented as in Figure 7. Altogether eight dif- ferent sequences are therefore available; compared to the millions in Stockhausen, this illustrates just how much more control the composer has retained over the final outcome. \r\nThe Trope from Boulez's Third Piano Sonata provided only a first and simple answer to the new problems of form. Although the composer already estab- lished new structural concepts, the territory as such was as yet hardly explored. This is particularly evident if we bear in mind that the free sequence \r\nof sections, which caused the most sensation in the beginning, was merely one aspect of the complex concept of form that awaited exploitation. \r\nHowever the case may be, through these preoccupations, form acquired unprecedented autonomy, despite the astonishing authority granted (for the time being) to the performer. This is already observed in the work of Mallarm\u00e9, who concentrated far more on the structure of language than on its significance, or, in other words, attempted to convert this significance into a symbolism of absolute value. Form had a life of its own, bringing the artist to an attitude of anonymity, since the intrusion of purely personal incidents was undesirable. Those with some knowledge of Asian culture will hardly be surprised by this. But in Europe relationships are different, and particularly for those less gifted than Boulez it is fitting to recall the words of Paul Val\u00e9ry, a confidant of Mallarm\u00e9. Concerning the latter's ambitions he spoke later (in his Lettre sur Mallarme) of 'diviniser la chose \u00e9crite' (divining that which is written). But, he went on, 'ce n'est point l'\u0153uvre faite et ses apparences ou ses effets dans le monde qui peuvent nous accomplir et nous \u00e9difier, mais seule- ment la mani\u00e8re dont nous l'avons faite (it is not the finished work and its appearances, or its effects on the world, which can fulfill and edify us, but only the manner in which we have accomplished it). \r\nIO \r\nThe concept of aleatory music has now broadened considerably, and we must certainly mention one other composer under this heading. \r\nWe have already examined two aspects: action duration and the sponta- neous decision in Stockhausen, and intervention possibilities in Boulez. In the latter the performer is like a driver who may choose from a limited num- ber of roads, while the road map itself remains the domain of the town plan- ner. Boulez described Stockhausen's solution as chance, while Stockhausen used the term gelenkter Zufall (guided chance); but as we have seen, in reali- ty the element of chance was less present than one might imagine. All this only made the problem of form most acute, and the composer who was to draw particularly radical conclusions was the American John Cage. Cage came to Europe in 1958 - I remember a momentous concert at the World Exhibition in Brussels - and was quick to cause the necessary stir. From his \r\npoint of view our controversy between tonality and atonality was long out- dated. He believed that modern serialists kept far too much to traditional paths, exposing themselves to a constant risk of academicism. \r\nA number of similarities, however, can also be found. Like Boulez, Cage's music reveals a pursuit of objectivity, or rather anonymity, which helps the sound to 'come to itself'. But his conclusions were much more radical. Instead of trying to bind the notes, his school attempted to soak off their adhesive, formed as it was by centuries of convention. If one hangs on to the notes, if one has 'musical' ideas, one cannot allow the notes to be themselves. And 'being themselves' means that there is no superimposed expression. (Many modern composers would go along with him up to this point, and the much older Var\u00e8se, with his 'liberation of the sound', was even a precursor.) And it also means that there is no man-made organisation. Thus, Cage reached a conclusion diametrically opposed to our early serialists: not com- plete determination, but rather complete indetermination was essential. (One of the most shocking experiences of recent times is to discover that both points of departure lead to the same degree of indetermination.) In order to achieve this indetermination, Cage used to make particular use of chance actions such as the tossing of coins, etc. Other means may also be employed, such as the oracle of the staves from the ancient Chinese book I-Ching (which illustrates the influence of Zen Buddhism on this composer), or mathemati- cal methods. \r\nMore recently, however, the accent has shifted towards the unforeseeable- ness of the performance itself, involving the actual performers. It is remark- able how completely different paths form striking parallels with modern European composers! Fifty years earlier Charles Ives, following quite a differ- ent line of thought, created the same sort of music as that of the young Sch\u00f6nberg and Stravinsky. Despite the shift towards live performance, a score was naturally still required as an instruction for the players. But the score must not be viewed as a ready-made, notated form. And this is where Cage differs: the composition is not an autonomous object, but a performance process. Obviously, this process has its boundaries - determined by the action of the players and by a number of characteristics - but essentially the music has no precedence above either note or noise. While it does have its own exis- tence, it remains 'transparent' in relation to its surroundings. Its boundaries become diffuse, and counting is not required, for we exist in time'. Stopwatches rather than bars serve to indicate when an occurrence of sound must take place within this time. Christian Wolff, a composer from the Cage group, replaced Stockhausen's eye ('unintentional glancing') with the ear: cer- tain occurrences of sound, caused by the one player, evoke reactions from the other (Duo for Pianists II). The outcome is determined by the performers themselves; finally, musical form may be conceived as 'the length of the pro- gramme'.7 \r\nCage is among those Westerners who have listened to the Japanese bow- \r\n\r\n8 \r\nman in chapter 6. Just how far his interpretation is correct, we will leave to the experts. Is this still music? Surely we see an influence on contemporary music that cannot be underestimated. Can everybody do the same? But not everybody does, is Cage's reply. Strong differences of opinion emerge. It is impossible to imagine the fascinating whirlpool of new developments with- out Cage. Whether the music comes from inside or outside, we cannot escape it. \r\n'One day when the windows were open, Christian Wolff played one of his pieces at the piano. Sounds of traffic, boat horns, were heard not only during the silences in the music but, being louder, were more easily heard than the piano sounds themselves. Afterwards, someone asked Christian Wolff to play the piece again with the windows closed. Christian Wolff said he'd be glad to, but that it wasn't really necessary, since the sounds of the environment were in no sense an interruption of those of the music.' \r\nII \r\nThe above discussion helps us to clarify the concept of aleatory music. It is a generic term for all aspects of music that are not predetermined. The rela- tionship between determined and undetermined elements plays a role in all types of music. The undetermined element brings unforeseeableness with it, and can occur both in performance and during the process of composition. \r\nUnforeseeableness can be manifest in differing degrees. In the perform- ance of a classical composition, for example, the degree to which the fixated notation can be deviated from is limited. Performance of a piece by John Cage, on the other hand, can involve a high degree of unforeseeableness. But even here general patterns of expectation can be formulated. \r\nFinally, with regard to developments in the music of the period 1950-60, the following aspects are of importance: \r\nmore \r\n1. In Cage's work the element of chance to use this dubious word once - was a means to obtain indetermination and to escape from the human grasp of the music. Young European composers, on the other hand, were con- cerned with gaining even stricter control of the musical material: even this indeterminable area of free choice was consciously incorporated in the of composition. \r\nprocess \r\n2. Bearing in mind changing concepts of musical form, we can say that part of what once belonged to the individual and 'unique' work of art is now ascribed to the material employed by the performers. There is a certain incli- nation to make matters absolute, which corresponds logically to the excessive attention given to musical material that we have observed from 1950 onwards. 3. Expansionism, moreover, is not foreign to serial technique, in the sense that there is an inclination to exploit all the possibilities of the chosen mate- rial. The limited means of dodecaphony of the past have been extended to \r\n\r\nbecome an all-embracing permutation procedure; it soon became apparent, however, that this again was not sufficient to harness the wealth of resources that had been rallied. A written serial score realises only a few of the count- less possibilities, and the free choice of the performer can at least compensate this to a certain extent. The element of chance becomes a wider margin in the realisation of the (unforeseeable) permutation process. Far from coincidental is the attendant departure from the unique, once-and-for-all determined work of art. A remarkable dichotomy seems to arise between the realised con- dition of a single work of art and the 'possibly realisable' that is potentially present in the same. Here creative expansionism collides with ultimate boundaries. \r\n4. The element of chance can serve to fill another gap. With all due respect for their sometimes brilliant ideas, one can nonetheless consider that both Stockhausen and Boulez have maintained an only too simple notion of the role of what they call 'surprise' in the musical process. The former wrote: \"The degree of information is therefore at its highest when at any point in a musi- cal discourse the moment of surprise is at its strongest: the music constantly has \"something to say\". (Just before this he specifies: 'Surprise only occurs when the unexpected happens.')\" Boulez shares this opinion: \"... for any music that is a masterpiece is a music that allows the capacity to surprise at any moment. \r\nThis is not the place to contradict these ideas, but it is clear that from this point of view too, the involvement of the spontaneous decision of the per- former is most welcome: the 'surprise' within the boundaries of a work may increase, and the same goes for each subsequent performance. \r\n5. Increasing differentiation posed considerable problems with regard to traditional notation, which was not at all equal to its task. By involving the performer, this difficulty was eased on the one hand, while on the other new symbols had to be introduced to indicate players' actions. It was inevitable that this issue also had to be tackled once more, as is described in section 14. \r\n12 \r\nIn the reaction against abstractions, serial music lost more and more influence after 1960. Boulez has remained a bastion of serial academicism, but Stockhausen has changed enormously. He is no longer the great renewer, but continues to react with great flexibility to any external stimulus that he encounters. He is long past the stage of solving problems of form and tech- nique. From Carr\u00e9 (1960) and Originale (1961) onwards his work comprises. ever more heterogeneous elements including happenings, pop, quotations, indeterminate sound production (contact microphones), etc. \r\nThe use of contact microphones has now become very widespread, and this opens up a new direction in the application of electronic resources. In days past, electronic music was accurately recorded on tape in a studio. Many \r\nconsidered this an advantage: the composer exercised maximum control, while the inconstancies of live performance were eliminated. But this strict view could not be maintained, and in a next step (discussed in section 9) aleatory techniques were introduced, at first very cautiously among Europeans but after 1960 much more freely. Improvisation groups even appeared on stage working with electronic apparatus. The principle is simple: microphones attached to 'instruments' (that may or may not be recognisable as such) pick up vibrations that are normally neither audible nor usable and feed them to loudspeakers via amplifiers and possibly modulators. A new and hitherto unknown world of sound is brought to life. Unexpected surprises may occur too, and with them an immediate response from the performer. This was a typical feature of the post-1960 period. \r\nexper- \r\nOnce again it was Cage who led the way with such experiments. More important, however, was his awareness of the situation. For in his first iments with chance phenomena he discovered that he was still attempting to drag 'successful' results out of chance actions. Realising later on that this atti- tude was equivocal, he came to accept the induced results of chance. The result was no longer important, but rather the attitude of open-mindedness. Thus, he came to distinguish between chance actions and indetermination. In the first case the composer employs chance as a means, but to a limited degree such that he remains within a self-determined global circle. Indetermination, on the contrary, exceeds this circle: the result is in every respect indefinite; such music crops up out of time, undefined and inciden- tal, only to disappear once more without a trace. All things are interrelated,' Cage said, and taken up in the stream of time. Any (human) pursuit of a stat- ed \"aim\" is a simplification, and a departure from reality.' The lessons of Cage were developed further by an American \u2018second generation' around 1960. And once again the aesthetic consequences of the concept of indetermination were applied more radically than in Europe. In the work of La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Robert Ashley and the Fluxus Movement, almost all existing values and concepts relating to music were turned well and truly upside down. \r\nLa Monte Young (1935) worked with long chains of chords that developed systematically. His material is economical, and naturally comprises all that is 'sound', including that produced by nature, machines, and electronic resources. Performances may last a week or more and incorporate other ele- ments such as light, movement and theatre. His contemporary Terry Riley followed the same course. His music consists of long chains of repeated motifs, usually in elementary diatonic note patterns. Tape loops and feedback systems provide the characteristic tone colours; electronic and instrumental resources merge. These and other Americans shared a broad interest in wide- ly different idioms including jazz, pop and non-Western music. \r\nChance action - indetermination: many composers throughout the world now work within these borders. Only few are conscious of the background so brilliantly evoked by Cage in his writings. What is clear, however, is that serial concepts are disappearing; there is a growing reaction to their abstrac- tions and a tendency towards greater directness in music making. This is also expressed in the instrumental works of Berio, Ligeti, Kagel and others: music that is tailor-made for certain specialists, musicians who are required to make a creative contribution of their own rather than only faithfully reproduce a more or less authoritarian score. Such music renounces serial, abstractly deter- mined sound differentiation in favour of a more direct form of expression. Not only the actual notes, but sighs, scratches, shouts and moans become part of music making. The instrument literally becomes an extension of the human body. \r\nSimilar tendencies are found in music theatre. This rather vague term embodies so much variety that a comprehensive definition can hardly be given. In general, it can be viewed as a reaction to traditional theatrical and operatic forms, which have caused the nineteenth century to live on, leaving current issues to the realm of film. The 'raree show' idea has also been aban- doned, since divisions between audience and stage, between different partic- ipating disciplines, required abolition. Various directions emerged, from the political engagement of Nono (Intolleranza, 1960) to the more light-hearted or autonomous approach of Kagel (Sur Sc\u00e8ne, 1960) and Ligeti (Aventures, 1962). Nono connected with traditional opera, while Ligeti created a 'com- position with scenic, verbal and musical means'. Unlike the traditional Gesamtkunstwerk there is a tendency to grant the incorporated elements a life of their own, independent of one another and only joined by a common peri- od of time. Once again, vocal and instrumental techniques are extended to such a degree that the two flow together. \r\nAll such innovations amount to repeated attempts to break through exist- ing boundaries! From the beginning of the twentieth century, the failure of instrument making to keep pace with musical developments made itself increasingly felt. Factories were usually highly industrialised, geared to the mass production of traditional instruments and leaving no room for altruis- tic research in an artistic sense. Today's composer must still make do with instruments developed hundreds of years ago: thus the continual expansion of playing techniques towards the boundaries of human endeavour; thus the contact microphones; and thus the ongoing specialisation of the few players devoted exclusively to new music. ", "full_prompt": "8 \r\nIn section 4 we discussed various tendencies that began to emerge during and after the phase of punctual music. Around 1956 these became much clearer and enabled composers to draw certain conclusions. \r\n1. The statistical approach to music came to the foreground. The primary consideration became the ordering of higher categories of form rather than the organisation of detail. This was already indicated by use of the term 'group' to refer to what is really the smallest unit, characterised by the detailed effect of pitch, duration, timbre, etc.; within the group, however, a certain freedom was possible without encroaching on the characteristic of the group. This freedom was also evident in an easier use of interval proportions than was ever conceivable in classical dodecaphony. It was no longer a question of 'this and this' or 'so and so many notes, but of a certain degree of density. Density, register, direction of movement, degree of periodicity and many other concepts emerged as aspects of music that could be ordered serially. Attention to elements of detail made way for a more global determination, and thus for the concept of form. \r\n2. In this process the series became increasingly neutral, functioning more and more as a regulatory factor. Proportions became decisive: a 3rd from a pitch series is a 5/4 proportion that can be manifest in any other musical ele- ment. In so far as pitch series were still employed, they likewise had a neutral character and were naturally no longer bound to the twelve notes. The series in Gruppen still had twelve notes, and indeed a pronounced shape of its own, presumably to attain large proportional contrasts in the macrofield. The Klavierst\u00fccke I-IV however, dating from 1954, retained only the rudiments of the 12-note series. In the second and third pieces, respectively, they are as fol- lows: \r\nNono's Il Canto sospeso (1956) was based on the all-interval series shown in \r\nExample 109. Something similiar occurred in Messiaen's Livre d'Orgue (see Example 16). \r\n3. The outstanding scholar Gy\u00f6rgi Ligeti, who has already been mentioned, introduced the concept of interval permeability. In section 4 we have already observed how the interval, and indeed other musical elements too, lost its own existence by being taken up in higher, statistically determinable quanti- ties.4 This desensitisation evoked new problems and new possibilities. The music became manifest in layers, no longer characterised by the detail but by a global 'material state' (rough, granular, smooth, etc.). Such layers could be combined, and exact synchronisation was obviously no longer relevant. Indeed, exactness acquired a certain margin: synchronism was not essential, but rather the spatial distribution of 'material states'. Something of the sort had already been achieved by Messiaen, among others, with his modality, in which a certain indifferentiation likewise arose in terms of sequence of notes and intervals. In serial music composers went further: different tempos were combinable, and the new concept of field magnitude emerged, heralding another important phase in new music that is usually described as aleatory composition. \r\n9 \r\nThis did not appear out of thin air. Directly after the rigorously punctual style of the Structures, Boulez reacted with his Marteau sans Ma\u00eetre, completed in 1954, in which the tempo in particular fluctuates through the many changes, directions such as 'tempo et nuances tr\u00e8s instables', etc. The work breathes a freedom and suppleness that reminds one immediately of Debussy. The many short notes, separate or clustered, and the irrational values create a sort of written-out rubato (see Example 35). This differentiation, which was also manifest, though somewhat differently, in Stockhausen's work of the same period, moved the latter to express the following thoughts (freely cited): 'An inaccuracy factor arises in performance. The areas within which this factor is \r\n\r\nmanifest are time fields, and their dimensions are field magnitudes. In the past too this margin existed in performance, but was coincidental. Now we wish to capture these inaccuracies functionally. A series of field magnitudes, rather than a traditional series of fixated durations, can now be determinant.' \r\nThis meant the abandonment of our quantitative system of fixed-value notation and the creation of a way of indicating the boundaries within which indeterminacy may occur, something that could be done in many ways. In Example 67 Boulez used the sign to indicate the boundaries within which a number of short notes may be freely placed. Stockhausen developed a different method to indicate action duration, based on the principle that note duration is no longer counted, but determined during performance by means of a particular action prescribed by the composer. Thus, the time between two notes, for instance, may depend on that required by the player to move his hand, on the degree of complexity of a given touch or pedal movement, or on breathing considerations, etc. Once again, such physiolog- ical reactions had always existed; but Stockhausen wished to incorporate them functionally in his music. Although it sounds paradoxical, all this revealed a desire to control musical elements that cannot be accurately com- mitted to paper. It is clear, therefore, that it was not a question of the absolute values of these elements, but of their mutual relationships. \r\nThe rapidity of these innovations was remarkable. While the correspon- dence between macro- and micro-areas discussed in the previous sections was still hardly formulated, new territory was being explored. And each discovery required years of elaboration! Perhaps it was this hurried course of events that caused problems in Stockhausen's first composition in this field. Let us take a closer look at the Klavierst\u00fcck XI of 1957. \r\nNineteen groups are written down on a large piece of paper, all of very dif- ferent length and without any suggestion of sequence; some are illustrated in Example 110. According to the composer each group is in itself the result of serial ordering, based on different series to organise field magnitude propor- tions. We must take his word for it, since we have arrived at a situation in which serial manipulation can no longer be reconstructed without the help of the composer. Some groups include the familiar notes in small print that are to be played as fast as possible'. Action duration is taken into account, for the composer says that 'difficult chords and large leaps with one hand obviously require more time than simple chords and smaller intervals'. Although the notes in normal print have the customary quantitive notation of duration, an unexpected element is to play a role. Stockhausen prescribes the following: the performer is to glance unintentionally at the page and play the first group that catches his eye, in the tempo, dynamics and touch of his choice. The lat- ter, however, are classified by the composer beforehand: there are six tempos, for instance, ranging from tempo I, very fast, to tempo 6, very slow. Subsequently, the player's eye is caught unintentionally (without any attempt to connect particular groups) by another group which he now plays in accor- \r\n\r\ndance with directions given at the end of the previous group. Each group can be connected to any of the other eighteen, and all nineteen groups can there- fore be performed in the prescribed degrees of tempo, dynamics and touch. The characteristics of all groups are therefore variable within the chosen boundaries. The field magnitude of a following group is determined by indi- cations at the end of the preceding one. \r\nA performance does not necessarily include all the groups. If a group is repeated, indications are given for small modifications in the second render- ing, usually in the form of somewhat elementary octave transpositions. If a group occurs for a third time, it also brings one of the possible realisations of the whole piece to an end. The work is an example of open form, without direction or termination. The groups are spatially juxtaposed and can be com- bined in countless ways. In the many commentaries on this composition two aspects have been neglected or confused. \r\n1. The action duration - a decidedly positive element. Instead of \u2018counting' with a margin of inaccuracy, a spontaneous reaction arises, a realisation of the time structure at the moment of the action itself. Such music can therefore no longer be approached from the score, since the time structure is now deter- mined by the perception time of the performer himself, which is inseparable from physical reactions and abilities. Such freedom is therefore ostensible. Nothing is added to an existing structure (unlike jazz or basso continuo tech- nique); on the contrary, the player remains entirely bound to the composer's directions, but he becomes involved right down to his physical reactions. Notice that this action duration takes place within the boundaries of each group. The mutual bond between the groups is quite a different matter; it is created by means of what one could call: \r\n2. the spontaneous decision. The player is required to glance 'unintention- ally' and to link the very first group that catches his eye with the preceding one. The word 'chance' crops up here and is indeed to stay with us, whether relevant or not. But it is not a question of chance, for the performer may choose from no more than the 18 options determined by the composer. All possibilities are already enclosed in the concept. At best there is mention of an unconsidered decision at the last moment - freedom, indeed, but a free- dom without sense. The actual time experience of the action duration is absent, as is the considered decision of the composition process. It is a free- dom that is only possible thanks to another concept of form, that of the open form without causality. These new concepts of form have already been dis- cussed at several points, especially in relation to the theory of musical space. In this light Stockhausen's Klavierst\u00fcck XI is hardly new, but merely a confir- mation of a concept of form already found in Debussy. \r\nStockhausen's step was to transfer choice from the composer to the per- former; instead of a single notated version, many realisations of a piece become feasible. \r\n\r\n- \r\nBoulez was the first to recognise the real problem of the Klavierst\u00fcck XI. In the same period, but independently of Stockhausen, he worked on his Third Piano Sonata; at the same time he was confronted by the work of Mallarm\u00e9, whose literary preoccupations ran remarkably parallel despite the great dis- parity in time. In Boulez, too, the player gains a more important role, but this does nothing \r\nthe composer believes - to change the problem of form. He felt the necessity to develop a new form that adapts to the material available to the serial composer, which was constantly becoming more elastic. But form to Boulez was something more than the mosaics of Stockhausen's music, which were really nothing other than constantly changing combinations from millions of options. If the performer was free to choose, then his choice should preferably be made after some consideration, and with only a very lim- ited number of possibilities that were precisely determined by the composer. \r\nAn example is the overall structure of the Sonata (comprising five move- ments in the first concept): Antiphonie, Trope, Constellation, Strophe, S\u00e9quence. The sequence of the movements is free, providing that Constellation is always in the middle. The internal structure reflects the same approach. One of the movements, Trope, has four components: two so-called structures complexes (Parenth\u00e8se, Commentaire) and two structures simples (Glose, Texte). In the 'complex structures' the performer is again free to include or omit certain additional variants (given between brackets). \r\nThe sequence of these components is indicated in an ingenious manner. The unnumbered pages of the score are in a ring binder, and the player may begin where he wishes. The sequence is therefore directed - we usually read from front to back - but not predetermined (Boulez speaks of a forme circu- laire). There are normally four options, therefore, depending on the starting point: \r\n- \r\nP, C, C, \r\nG, T \r\nG, T, P G, T, P C \r\nT, P, C, G \r\nBut since the Commentaire section is included twice, four other possibilities become available, depending on where this section is placed (it may only be performed once); this can be represented as in Figure 7. Altogether eight dif- ferent sequences are therefore available; compared to the millions in Stockhausen, this illustrates just how much more control the composer has retained over the final outcome. \r\nThe Trope from Boulez's Third Piano Sonata provided only a first and simple answer to the new problems of form. Although the composer already estab- lished new structural concepts, the territory as such was as yet hardly explored. This is particularly evident if we bear in mind that the free sequence \r\nof sections, which caused the most sensation in the beginning, was merely one aspect of the complex concept of form that awaited exploitation. \r\nHowever the case may be, through these preoccupations, form acquired unprecedented autonomy, despite the astonishing authority granted (for the time being) to the performer. This is already observed in the work of Mallarm\u00e9, who concentrated far more on the structure of language than on its significance, or, in other words, attempted to convert this significance into a symbolism of absolute value. Form had a life of its own, bringing the artist to an attitude of anonymity, since the intrusion of purely personal incidents was undesirable. Those with some knowledge of Asian culture will hardly be surprised by this. But in Europe relationships are different, and particularly for those less gifted than Boulez it is fitting to recall the words of Paul Val\u00e9ry, a confidant of Mallarm\u00e9. Concerning the latter's ambitions he spoke later (in his Lettre sur Mallarme) of 'diviniser la chose \u00e9crite' (divining that which is written). But, he went on, 'ce n'est point l'\u0153uvre faite et ses apparences ou ses effets dans le monde qui peuvent nous accomplir et nous \u00e9difier, mais seule- ment la mani\u00e8re dont nous l'avons faite (it is not the finished work and its appearances, or its effects on the world, which can fulfill and edify us, but only the manner in which we have accomplished it). \r\nIO \r\nThe concept of aleatory music has now broadened considerably, and we must certainly mention one other composer under this heading. \r\nWe have already examined two aspects: action duration and the sponta- neous decision in Stockhausen, and intervention possibilities in Boulez. In the latter the performer is like a driver who may choose from a limited num- ber of roads, while the road map itself remains the domain of the town plan- ner. Boulez described Stockhausen's solution as chance, while Stockhausen used the term gelenkter Zufall (guided chance); but as we have seen, in reali- ty the element of chance was less present than one might imagine. All this only made the problem of form most acute, and the composer who was to draw particularly radical conclusions was the American John Cage. Cage came to Europe in 1958 - I remember a momentous concert at the World Exhibition in Brussels - and was quick to cause the necessary stir. From his \r\npoint of view our controversy between tonality and atonality was long out- dated. He believed that modern serialists kept far too much to traditional paths, exposing themselves to a constant risk of academicism. \r\nA number of similarities, however, can also be found. Like Boulez, Cage's music reveals a pursuit of objectivity, or rather anonymity, which helps the sound to 'come to itself'. But his conclusions were much more radical. Instead of trying to bind the notes, his school attempted to soak off their adhesive, formed as it was by centuries of convention. If one hangs on to the notes, if one has 'musical' ideas, one cannot allow the notes to be themselves. And 'being themselves' means that there is no superimposed expression. (Many modern composers would go along with him up to this point, and the much older Var\u00e8se, with his 'liberation of the sound', was even a precursor.) And it also means that there is no man-made organisation. Thus, Cage reached a conclusion diametrically opposed to our early serialists: not com- plete determination, but rather complete indetermination was essential. (One of the most shocking experiences of recent times is to discover that both points of departure lead to the same degree of indetermination.) In order to achieve this indetermination, Cage used to make particular use of chance actions such as the tossing of coins, etc. Other means may also be employed, such as the oracle of the staves from the ancient Chinese book I-Ching (which illustrates the influence of Zen Buddhism on this composer), or mathemati- cal methods. \r\nMore recently, however, the accent has shifted towards the unforeseeable- ness of the performance itself, involving the actual performers. It is remark- able how completely different paths form striking parallels with modern European composers! Fifty years earlier Charles Ives, following quite a differ- ent line of thought, created the same sort of music as that of the young Sch\u00f6nberg and Stravinsky. Despite the shift towards live performance, a score was naturally still required as an instruction for the players. But the score must not be viewed as a ready-made, notated form. And this is where Cage differs: the composition is not an autonomous object, but a performance process. Obviously, this process has its boundaries - determined by the action of the players and by a number of characteristics - but essentially the music has no precedence above either note or noise. While it does have its own exis- tence, it remains 'transparent' in relation to its surroundings. Its boundaries become diffuse, and counting is not required, for we exist in time'. Stopwatches rather than bars serve to indicate when an occurrence of sound must take place within this time. Christian Wolff, a composer from the Cage group, replaced Stockhausen's eye ('unintentional glancing') with the ear: cer- tain occurrences of sound, caused by the one player, evoke reactions from the other (Duo for Pianists II). The outcome is determined by the performers themselves; finally, musical form may be conceived as 'the length of the pro- gramme'.7 \r\nCage is among those Westerners who have listened to the Japanese bow- \r\n\r\n8 \r\nman in chapter 6. Just how far his interpretation is correct, we will leave to the experts. Is this still music? Surely we see an influence on contemporary music that cannot be underestimated. Can everybody do the same? But not everybody does, is Cage's reply. Strong differences of opinion emerge. It is impossible to imagine the fascinating whirlpool of new developments with- out Cage. Whether the music comes from inside or outside, we cannot escape it. \r\n'One day when the windows were open, Christian Wolff played one of his pieces at the piano. Sounds of traffic, boat horns, were heard not only during the silences in the music but, being louder, were more easily heard than the piano sounds themselves. Afterwards, someone asked Christian Wolff to play the piece again with the windows closed. Christian Wolff said he'd be glad to, but that it wasn't really necessary, since the sounds of the environment were in no sense an interruption of those of the music.' \r\nII \r\nThe above discussion helps us to clarify the concept of aleatory music. It is a generic term for all aspects of music that are not predetermined. The rela- tionship between determined and undetermined elements plays a role in all types of music. The undetermined element brings unforeseeableness with it, and can occur both in performance and during the process of composition. \r\nUnforeseeableness can be manifest in differing degrees. In the perform- ance of a classical composition, for example, the degree to which the fixated notation can be deviated from is limited. Performance of a piece by John Cage, on the other hand, can involve a high degree of unforeseeableness. But even here general patterns of expectation can be formulated. \r\nFinally, with regard to developments in the music of the period 1950-60, the following aspects are of importance: \r\nmore \r\n1. In Cage's work the element of chance to use this dubious word once - was a means to obtain indetermination and to escape from the human grasp of the music. Young European composers, on the other hand, were con- cerned with gaining even stricter control of the musical material: even this indeterminable area of free choice was consciously incorporated in the of composition. \r\nprocess \r\n2. Bearing in mind changing concepts of musical form, we can say that part of what once belonged to the individual and 'unique' work of art is now ascribed to the material employed by the performers. There is a certain incli- nation to make matters absolute, which corresponds logically to the excessive attention given to musical material that we have observed from 1950 onwards. 3. Expansionism, moreover, is not foreign to serial technique, in the sense that there is an inclination to exploit all the possibilities of the chosen mate- rial. The limited means of dodecaphony of the past have been extended to \r\n\r\nbecome an all-embracing permutation procedure; it soon became apparent, however, that this again was not sufficient to harness the wealth of resources that had been rallied. A written serial score realises only a few of the count- less possibilities, and the free choice of the performer can at least compensate this to a certain extent. The element of chance becomes a wider margin in the realisation of the (unforeseeable) permutation process. Far from coincidental is the attendant departure from the unique, once-and-for-all determined work of art. A remarkable dichotomy seems to arise between the realised con- dition of a single work of art and the 'possibly realisable' that is potentially present in the same. Here creative expansionism collides with ultimate boundaries. \r\n4. The element of chance can serve to fill another gap. With all due respect for their sometimes brilliant ideas, one can nonetheless consider that both Stockhausen and Boulez have maintained an only too simple notion of the role of what they call 'surprise' in the musical process. The former wrote: \"The degree of information is therefore at its highest when at any point in a musi- cal discourse the moment of surprise is at its strongest: the music constantly has \"something to say\". (Just before this he specifies: 'Surprise only occurs when the unexpected happens.')\" Boulez shares this opinion: \"... for any music that is a masterpiece is a music that allows the capacity to surprise at any moment. \r\nThis is not the place to contradict these ideas, but it is clear that from this point of view too, the involvement of the spontaneous decision of the per- former is most welcome: the 'surprise' within the boundaries of a work may increase, and the same goes for each subsequent performance. \r\n5. Increasing differentiation posed considerable problems with regard to traditional notation, which was not at all equal to its task. By involving the performer, this difficulty was eased on the one hand, while on the other new symbols had to be introduced to indicate players' actions. It was inevitable that this issue also had to be tackled once more, as is described in section 14. \r\n12 \r\nIn the reaction against abstractions, serial music lost more and more influence after 1960. Boulez has remained a bastion of serial academicism, but Stockhausen has changed enormously. He is no longer the great renewer, but continues to react with great flexibility to any external stimulus that he encounters. He is long past the stage of solving problems of form and tech- nique. From Carr\u00e9 (1960) and Originale (1961) onwards his work comprises. ever more heterogeneous elements including happenings, pop, quotations, indeterminate sound production (contact microphones), etc. \r\nThe use of contact microphones has now become very widespread, and this opens up a new direction in the application of electronic resources. In days past, electronic music was accurately recorded on tape in a studio. Many \r\nconsidered this an advantage: the composer exercised maximum control, while the inconstancies of live performance were eliminated. But this strict view could not be maintained, and in a next step (discussed in section 9) aleatory techniques were introduced, at first very cautiously among Europeans but after 1960 much more freely. Improvisation groups even appeared on stage working with electronic apparatus. The principle is simple: microphones attached to 'instruments' (that may or may not be recognisable as such) pick up vibrations that are normally neither audible nor usable and feed them to loudspeakers via amplifiers and possibly modulators. A new and hitherto unknown world of sound is brought to life. Unexpected surprises may occur too, and with them an immediate response from the performer. This was a typical feature of the post-1960 period. \r\nexper- \r\nOnce again it was Cage who led the way with such experiments. More important, however, was his awareness of the situation. For in his first iments with chance phenomena he discovered that he was still attempting to drag 'successful' results out of chance actions. Realising later on that this atti- tude was equivocal, he came to accept the induced results of chance. The result was no longer important, but rather the attitude of open-mindedness. Thus, he came to distinguish between chance actions and indetermination. In the first case the composer employs chance as a means, but to a limited degree such that he remains within a self-determined global circle. Indetermination, on the contrary, exceeds this circle: the result is in every respect indefinite; such music crops up out of time, undefined and inciden- tal, only to disappear once more without a trace. All things are interrelated,' Cage said, and taken up in the stream of time. Any (human) pursuit of a stat- ed \"aim\" is a simplification, and a departure from reality.' The lessons of Cage were developed further by an American \u2018second generation' around 1960. And once again the aesthetic consequences of the concept of indetermination were applied more radically than in Europe. In the work of La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Robert Ashley and the Fluxus Movement, almost all existing values and concepts relating to music were turned well and truly upside down. \r\nLa Monte Young (1935) worked with long chains of chords that developed systematically. His material is economical, and naturally comprises all that is 'sound', including that produced by nature, machines, and electronic resources. Performances may last a week or more and incorporate other ele- ments such as light, movement and theatre. His contemporary Terry Riley followed the same course. His music consists of long chains of repeated motifs, usually in elementary diatonic note patterns. Tape loops and feedback systems provide the characteristic tone colours; electronic and instrumental resources merge. These and other Americans shared a broad interest in wide- ly different idioms including jazz, pop and non-Western music. \r\nChance action - indetermination: many composers throughout the world now work within these borders. Only few are conscious of the background so brilliantly evoked by Cage in his writings. What is clear, however, is that serial concepts are disappearing; there is a growing reaction to their abstrac- tions and a tendency towards greater directness in music making. This is also expressed in the instrumental works of Berio, Ligeti, Kagel and others: music that is tailor-made for certain specialists, musicians who are required to make a creative contribution of their own rather than only faithfully reproduce a more or less authoritarian score. Such music renounces serial, abstractly deter- mined sound differentiation in favour of a more direct form of expression. Not only the actual notes, but sighs, scratches, shouts and moans become part of music making. The instrument literally becomes an extension of the human body. \r\nSimilar tendencies are found in music theatre. This rather vague term embodies so much variety that a comprehensive definition can hardly be given. In general, it can be viewed as a reaction to traditional theatrical and operatic forms, which have caused the nineteenth century to live on, leaving current issues to the realm of film. The 'raree show' idea has also been aban- doned, since divisions between audience and stage, between different partic- ipating disciplines, required abolition. Various directions emerged, from the political engagement of Nono (Intolleranza, 1960) to the more light-hearted or autonomous approach of Kagel (Sur Sc\u00e8ne, 1960) and Ligeti (Aventures, 1962). Nono connected with traditional opera, while Ligeti created a 'com- position with scenic, verbal and musical means'. Unlike the traditional Gesamtkunstwerk there is a tendency to grant the incorporated elements a life of their own, independent of one another and only joined by a common peri- od of time. Once again, vocal and instrumental techniques are extended to such a degree that the two flow together. \r\nAll such innovations amount to repeated attempts to break through exist- ing boundaries! From the beginning of the twentieth century, the failure of instrument making to keep pace with musical developments made itself increasingly felt. Factories were usually highly industrialised, geared to the mass production of traditional instruments and leaving no room for altruis- tic research in an artistic sense. Today's composer must still make do with instruments developed hundreds of years ago: thus the continual expansion of playing techniques towards the boundaries of human endeavour; thus the contact microphones; and thus the ongoing specialisation of the few players devoted exclusively to new music. \n\nUse only the details found in the text above to inform your answer.\n\nWhich composers are credited with creating and expanding the framework for aleatory composition in its early days?
